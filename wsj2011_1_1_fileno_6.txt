KARACHI, Pakistanâ€”Pakistan's federal government Saturday increased prices of gasoline and diesel among other fuels, passing on the impact of rising international crude prices as a subsidy burden pinched its pocket. 

An official at the ministry of petroleum said global crude prices had witnessed an uptrend, making it imperative for the government to lift fuel prices. 

The government raised the price of gasoline, or petrol, by 6.71 Pakistan rupees per liter to 79.67 rupees ($0.93), a statement from the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority said. 

The price of kerosene oil was raised by 4.04 rupees per liter to 74.99 while the price for high speed diesel rose to 82.58, up by 4.25 per liter, it said. 

High-octane prices have been lifted by 7.69 rupees per liter to 94.36, while the price for light diesel has been increased by 4.36 per liter to 70.97. 

The official said the federal government's subsidy burden would have come to 4.7 billion rupees per month had fuel prices been left unchanged. 

Annual demand of petroleum products in Pakistan stands at about 20 million tons (400,000 barrels per day), of which only 13% is met internally. Pakistan imports crude and refined petroleum products such as motor spirit, high-speed diesel and furnace oil to meet its remaining requirement.
