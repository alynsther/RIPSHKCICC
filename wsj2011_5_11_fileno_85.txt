There's no denying Jorge Posada has looked lost at the plate this season. He has hit around .150 all year, and considering his age and background as a catcher, there is little historical evidence to suggest that will change all that much. But instead of fretting about Posada's miserable batting average, perhaps Yankee fans should be focusing on his home runs—his power surge is nearly unprecedented. 

Only 13 players in major-league history who were active for their age-39 season had caught more games than Posada has in his career (1,573). Their collective batting average that season was just .239, and six of them hit below .220, generally in part-time duty or as a designated hitter like Posada. Only one guy on the list hit more than six homers—the number Posada had through Monday—in his age-39 year: Hall-of-Famer Carlton Fisk. In 1987, he had by far the best season ever among 39 year-olds with that many games logged behind the plate. That year, Fisk played in 135 games for the Chicago White Sox, hitting .256 with 23 home runs and 71 RBIs. He ultimately played until 1993, retiring at the advanced age of 45. Incredibly, Fisk hit .266 with 72 homers and 282 RBIs after turning 40, playing the vast majority of his games at catcher.

But Fisk is the exception that proves the rule. The other 12 players on our list of comparable players to Posada hit a combined total of 27 home runs in their age-39 seasons, and at least six of them hit fewer than three. (Ivan Rodriguez, who is currently in his age-39 year for Washington, could become the seventh.) 

Only two of them drove in more than 30 runs. With 14 RBIs, Posada should surpass that total if he stays in the lineup the rest of the season.

Among the players who have caught more games than Jorge Posada, here are the ones who hit at least two home runs in their age-39 season.
