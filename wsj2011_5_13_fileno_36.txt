Sloppy. That's the only word that accurately describes the Yankees on Thursday night, as they handed the Kansas City Royals six runs in the second inning, and then played catch-up all night in an 11-5 loss.

Ivan Nova put a few men on the bases with some cheap hits, and the fielders did the rest. Robinson Cano threw away a potential double play ball, and Francisco Cervelli let a ball get away to let runners advance—and then threw away a pickoff attempt. By the time Nova was back in the dugout, it was 6-0 Kansas City. He allowed two more runs in the fourth, before departing with only three innings on his resume.

The Yankee offense was no-hit for 4.1 innings, and after that they couldn't do enough to get back into the game.

DENVER—The Mets needed a new source of power in Ike Davis' absence. They found one in Carlos Beltran, who did far more than compensate for Davis' injury.

Beltran hit a career-high three home runs and drove in six runs in the Mets' 9-5 victory over the Colorado Rockies. And after a rainout Wednesday and a two-hour rain delay Thursday, the Mets finally won the rubber game of the three-game series.

Beltran is increasing his value by the day. All three of his home runs were two-run shots. He became the eighth player in franchise history to hit three home runs in a game and the first since Jose Reyes did it on Aug. 15, 2006.

Mets starter Jon Niese allowed five runs in 6 1/3 innings, though he didn't pitch as poorly as his line suggests.
