What's not to like about perky, popular "Glee"? Musicians love how when their songs are performed on the show, the originals shoot up the iTunes charts. But some rockers are snarling that not everybody has to sing along.

 Foo Fighters 

Last week, frontman Dave Grohl told the Hollywood Reporter that it was "every band's right" to refuse to license its songs to the show. 

 Guns N' Roses 

Former lead guitarist Slash told EW in January that he is no fan of "Grease" or "Glee." The show's co-creator Ryan Murphy then told the Hollywood Reporter that he thinks people who make such comments are "uneducated and quite stupid." 

 Coldplay 

"Glee" music producer Adam Anders originally wanted "Viva la Vida" as the featured number in the show's pilot episode but Coldplay declined. The band later apologized and granted full access to its catalog. Now Gwyneth Paltrow, wife of Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, is a favorite guest. 

 Kings of Leon 

Mr. Murphy accused Kings of Leon of indirectly bashing arts education by not allowing the show to adapt their hit "Use Somebody." Drummer Nathan Followill tweeted that Mr. Murphy should "see a therapist." A spokesman for the band says its position remains, "this was never meant as a slap in the face to 'Glee.' "
