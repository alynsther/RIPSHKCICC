MUMBAI -- TA Associates Inc. of the U.S. will acquire a minority stake in Tega Industries, a Kolkata-based engineering company, for $40 million, said two people with direct knowledge of the matter.

Tega makes products for use in mineral processing, material handling and grinding. TA Associates, previously, has invested in companies such as mobile phone manufacturer Micromax Informatics Ltd.

"The investment will be used towards organic and inorganic growth options when the company decides to go in for large acquisitions," said one of the sources.

The company is looking for acquisitions in the Americas, the second person said.

Tega will deploy the money from TA Associates at its existing facilities in Chile, he added.

The company secretary did not want to comment on the transaction. TA Associates didn't respond to e-mail request for comment.

Tega's acquisitions earlier this year of Chile's Acotec SA and Australia's Losugen Pty are expected to take Tega's revenue to over 10 billion rupees.

"With these two acquisitions, Tega stepped up its presence in Australia, South America, Africa and Asia, critical areas for natural resource production," said  Preet Mohan Singh, executive director and head of industrials group at Avendus Capital Pvt. Ltd.

Avendus advised Tega on the transaction and on the two earlier acquisitions.

While Australian company Losungen designs products for the mining industry, Acotec focuses on abrasion and wear-resistant products.

The segments that the companies operate in are expected to grow, said  Mayur Patel, an analyst with Spark Capital Advisors (I) Pvt. Ltd.

"Additionally, the demand also comes from the replacement market," he said. "So the downside is limited and not subject to cyclical variations in the industry."
