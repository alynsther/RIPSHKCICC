 ON YOUR MARK... Coming of Age is a Philadelphia-based nonprofit that helps people age 50-plus explore possible new directions, as well as ways to connect with peers and contribute to their communities. The same thinking is behind the organization's new (free) book, "The Age for Change: An E-Book for People 50+." (You can read it online, download it to an e-reader or print it out.) Edited by journalist  Gloria Hochman, the book's nine chapters tackle, among other topics, transitions from first careers, dealing with adult children, the meaning of work in our lives, how friendships evolve and building new networks. Coming of Age describes "Age for Change" as a "living document," one that will add pages and issues based on feedback from readers. A good introduction to life beyond the office.

 BACK TO SCHOOL Many people approaching retirement are intrigued by the possibility of teaching and working with young people. Two reports from Civic Ventures, a San Francisco nonprofit, show how individuals and organizations across the country are doing just that. The first, "A New Equation: How Encore Careers in Math and Science Education Equal More Success for Students," highlights how older adults with varied professional backgrounds can make a difference inside schools. The second report, "Beyond the Classroom: Engaging Boomers in Encore Careers That Help Students Succeed," focuses on after-school programs and efforts to help young people get into college, among other initiatives. On both counts, instructive—and inspiring—reading.
