 Amanda Shires, 'Carrying Lightning,' Tuesday 

This singer-songwriter, now 29 years old, grew up in Lubbock and Mineral Wells, Texas, started playing fiddle with the Texas Playboys as a teenager, and now lives in Nashville, Tenn. Her strong, palpitating voice has drawn comparisons to Dolly Parton, but her work is less ethereal, more soulful and darker. There's some Tom Waits and George Jones in there, too. One new song: "When You Need a Train It Never Comes." Also wielding a ukulele, she's touring with guitarist Rod Picott (he co-wrote the modern classic "Broke Down" with Slaid Cleaves). See an exclusive video of "Shake the Walls" at WSJ.com/Speakeasy.

 Willem de Kooning, Pace Gallery, New York; opens Friday 

Willem de Kooning, who once said, "Flesh is the reason oil paint was invented," didn't stint on those skin tones in his celebrated 1969 "Montauk" paintings. Three works from that series, which show a woman morphing into landscape, go on display in this exhibit. "Willem de Kooning: The Figure: Movement and Gesture" showcases roughly 35 works by the abstract expressionist artist, including 6-foot oil drawings that have never before been displayed. Built around rarely viewed private loans, it's mostly for window-shoppers: just a handful of works are for sale.

 'The House of Blue Leaves,'  Walter Kerr Theatre, New York  

When the Tony Award nominees are announced Tuesday, Broadway-watchers will be listening for Edie Falco's name as a contender for best actress. Ms. Falco (left), who dons a grimy blonde wig and formless clothes to play the heavily medicated schizophrenic wife Bananas in John Guare's bleak comedy, won praise from many critics this week after the play's opening. But reviews were otherwise mixed about the production, which co-stars Ben Stiller as Ms. Falco's zookeeper-husband who aspires to be a songwriter, and Jennifer Jason Leigh as his hard-hearted mistress.
