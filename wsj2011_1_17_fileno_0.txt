In November, we wrote about the European Union's somewhat clumsy attempt to force Internet companies to obtain permission from users before placing cookies, small files then used to help deliver advertising and other targeted content, on their computers. 

The directive mandates "informed consent" by users. EU member states now have until late May to write the directive into their national legislation. Legal experts say the wording leaves plenty of room for interpretation, and that's caused Internet companies to fear that some countries could overzealously interpret the document and make websites obtain permission every time a computer user makes a visit, which could gridlock the functioning of ad-based sites. 

They needn't worry too much. Last week, a secret European Commission document written to offer formal guidance to EU member states implementing the directive surfaced. It sheds a bit of light on how EU regulators see the directive, and that's firmly on the side of business. 

There's no language at all endorsing any kind of "opt-in" clause, which would force users to give their consent explicitly before cookies are placed on their computer. "Settings of a browser or another application" are sufficient, the document says. 

"It is not necessary," the document says, "to obtain consent for each individual operation of gaining access to or storing of information on a user's terminal, if the initial information and consent covered such further use." 

The document also explicitly endorses the notion of self-regulation, which the industry is working on. "The Commission services consider that the industry is well placed to design innovative technical solutions," the document says. 

Says an industry lobbyist: "We're happy with what this says."
