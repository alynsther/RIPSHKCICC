MILWAUKEEâ€”The Knicks on Sunday played their worst quarter of the season and for the third time in a week allowed an opposing player to score his career high in points.

With their 100-95 loss to the Bucks, who never trailed, the Knicks fell to 7-8 since the Carmelo Anthony trade.

It's safe to say things aren't going as planned.

Bucks forward Carlos Delfino scored 30 points, and his 3-pointer directly in front of Anthony with 1:43 remaining gave the Bucks the 91-84 cushion they'd need to hold off the Knicks, who battled back after shooting 4 for 25 from the field while being outscored 32-9 in the first quarter. 

The Knicks outscored the Bucks 32-15 in the second quarter behind Chauncey Billups's 16 points and cut the lead to 73-72 after Anthony's 3-pointer with 26 seconds left in the third quarter. But they were never able to take the lead.

Amar'e Stoudemire finished with 25 points and Anthony had 23. For the Bucks, guard Brandon Jennings was one assist shy of a triple-double, with 13 points, 11 rebounds and nine assists.

"We did come back,'' Knicks coach Mike D'Antoni said. "We didn't come up with the plays at the end."

The offense again looked lethargic, despite the fact that the team met on Saturday to watch film and clear the air regarding their offensive problems. After the Knicks' loss on Friday in Detroit, Stoudemire criticized the newest Knicks for not buying into coach Mike D'Antoni's system. Anthony said he didn't take the comments personally, but the offensive problems carried into Sunday. Billups acknowledged that the team is "ways away" from where it needs to be. 

Stoudemire said the problems at the offensive end are being caused by a lack of execution and not getting into the team's set plays. 

Shelden Williams got his first start as a Knick at center, as D'Antoni cited the need for size. But the experiment failed as Williams played only six minutes and did not score a point.
