'Modernist Cuisine,' by former Microsoft chief technology officer Nathan Myhrvold, with Chris Young and Maxime Bilet, isn't for the timid. With over 2,400 pages and a price tag of $625, the six-volume cookbook set (to be published March 14) is a deep investigation into the science of cooking, filled with avant-garde techniques. Many of the recipes involve sous vide cooking (in which ingredients are sealed in airtight plastic bags and slowly cooked, often in water), and the book's list of "must-have tools" includes liquid nitrogen, a centrifuge and a tabletop homogenizer.

Take the book's hamburger. Prepping the lettuce and tomato requires a vacuum sealer. The cheese is restructured—heated with ingredients like carrageenan and cooled in a mold—for a gooier texture. And making the burger itself requires hand-grinding the beef and using half-cylinder molds to catch the strands and gently form the patties. 

Total time for the recipe: 30 hours, including time for the bun dough to rise, 2½ hours for preparation and 20 minutes for assembly.
