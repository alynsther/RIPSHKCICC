The Australian  Consul-General Phillip Scanlan is this weekend asking New Yorkers to rally around the country's flood-relief efforts and raise a drink at the Australian, a Midtown bar. 

The costs of cleanup throughout the region hit by the floods, which began last month and haven't let up, are likely to exceed $15 billion. 

On Saturday from noon until midnight and Jan. 20 from 6 p.m. until 10 p.m., the Australian bar will give a free drink to those who donate $20 to Queensland Premier  Anna Bligh's flood relief fund. The bar will also donate $2 from every drink sold to the fund and provide live Aussie music.
