The India-focused company said that the wind farms will be set up in two phases--500 MW and 2,500 MW--with the first phase priced at 47.5 million rupees a MW and the second phase at a base price of 50 million rupees a MW, implying a total contract value of at least 148.75 billion rupees. 

Caparo Energy has agreed to pay Suzlon Energy advances of up to 7.5 billion rupees in four installments over three years, according to the document. 

Also, Suzlon will take up the project development and construction risks, and will be responsible for regulatory clearances, land acquisition as well as for setting up the wind projects, Caparo Energy had said. 

The projects were to have generation capacities ranging from 50 MW to 100 MW each and will cover the states of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan and Gujarat.
