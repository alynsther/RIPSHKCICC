LOS ANGELESâ€”Maria, a neighborhood goose that recently pecked her way to national fame, has moved temporarily to the Los Angeles Zoo, and out of harm's way, while the lake she calls home is drained and cleaned.

The gray goose with a thick belly and proud neck had distinguished herself at Echo Park Lake here by attaching herself to humans, most notably a retiree named  Dominic Ehrler. Neighbors, and later a larger audience, noticed that she would walk or fly by Mr. Ehrler's side every morning. Mr. Ehrler called Maria his "best friend" and even stopped eating poultry as their relationship blossomed. But their friendship was threatened by a city rehabilitation project planned for the lake later this year, involving draining it and fencing it off.

Mr. Ehrler, Maria and their uncertain future were the subject of a Feb. 12 front-page article in The Wall Street Journal, which in turn drew other national media attention.

The city had originally planned to leave Maria and the dozens of other geese and ducks at the construction site to fend for themselves. But an outpouring of support for Maria nudged officials to take a different tack in her case.

City Council Member Eric Garcetti, who represents Maria's district, wrote on his blog Tuesday: "Maria is a special part of the Echo Park community and we want to make sure she is in a safe place during the restoration project."



He added that Maria would be returned "home" to Echo Park Lake after the reconstruction is complete.

Mr. Ehrler issued a statement saying he fully supported the move, although he would miss his daily walks together with Maria at the lake.

He said that in the next few weeks Maria would get a full checkup at the zoo.

"Maria's sex has never officially been determined," Mr. Ehrler said. "She may actually be Mario."
