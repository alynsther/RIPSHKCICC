Just two races into the new Formula 1 season, Sebastian Vettel is already an odds-on favorite to win a second straight world championship.

So far, Vettel has looked unbeatable. In both the opening races, he's been the fastest driver in practice, the fastest in qualifying, and has led each race from start to finish. Going back to the end of last season, he has now won five of the last six races and oddsmakers offer just 8/11 that he will finish this season as world champion.

But ahead of this season's Chinese Grand Prix, there may be reasons to avoid the 7/4 on Betfair for Vettel to win both qualifying and the race. 

Despite winning here in 2009, the Red Bull driver's bid for a third straight win could be undone by glitches in the team's Kers power-boost system.

Introduced this season to encourage more passing, Kers adds an extra 80hp for drivers to use on power. The Shanghai racetrack, where the longest straight is more than 1km long, should favor those teams with the best Kers system, such as McLaren.

Despite struggling in preseason, McLaren has been Red Bull's biggest challenger, with Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button combining for two podium finishes. It would have been three, but tyre damage and a collision caused Hamilton to finish eighth last time out in Malaysia. He should secure another top-three finish here, which can be backed at 4/5 with Stan James.
