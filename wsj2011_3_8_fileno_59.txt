New Yankees reliever Rafael Soriano has been very good in his career, but, by one measure he also appears to have been very lucky.

Overall, major-league hitters have about a .300 batting average once they put a ball in play, and baseball's stat geeks agree that a pitcher's allowed Batting Average on Balls in Play usually won't stray far, or for long, from that .300 mark. A pitcher that's much higher than that is assumed to be unlucky; much lower than that, he's thought to be living on borrowed time.

Soriano's career Babip allowed is .242, which ranks him 12th all-time, and behind only Troy Percival since 1980, among pitchers with at least 300 innings. In Soriano's six years in which he has pitched at least 47 innings, he has never allowed hitters to top .275 when they hit it in play. In three seasons, his Babip has been .241 or better. He has been under .200 twice.

Two Yankees have topped Soriano's career Babip: Andy Messersmith, who's most famous for his lawsuit that established free agency, and some guy named Babe Ruth. All-time career Babip leader Dick Hughes finished second to Tom Seaver in the 1967 Rookie of the Year voting and started two World Series games that year for the Cardinals. Less than a year later, a shoulder injury ended his career.

Soriano himself missed a year after tearing his elbow in 2004. Last year, with the Tampa Bay Rays, he led the American League in saves to earn a three-year, $35 million contract from the Yankees, where he'll be the late-inning bridge to Mariano Rivera. Lucky or not, if Soriano again posts a Babip anywhere near his career rate, he'd undoubtedly finish 2011 as one of baseball's best set-up men. 

New Yankee relief pitcher Rafael Soriano ranks below just 11 pitchers all-time (with a minimum of 300 innings pitched) in career allowed Batting Average on Balls in Play..
