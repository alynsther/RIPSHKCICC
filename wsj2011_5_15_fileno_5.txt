Jorge Posada, who precipitated one of the stranger incidents in recent Yankees history by removing himself from the starting lineup before a game Saturday night, apologized to manager Joe Girardi after arriving at Yankee Stadium on Sunday.

"I had a bad day," Posada said. "I reflected on it and all the frustration and stuff, and all the frustration just came out. I'm trying to move on."

A 17-year major-league veteran who has caught close to 1,600 games for the Yankees, Posada is off to the worst start of his career, batting .165 through his first 109 at-bats this season and struggling to adjust to being a full-time designated hitter.

Girardi had planned to bat him ninth in the Yankees' game Saturday against the Red Sox, but Posada told him an hour before the first pitch that he did not want to play. The demand led to something of a he-said-he said situation between Posada and general manager Brian Cashman, who told reporters during Saturday's game that Posada had not cited an injury in asking out of the lineup.

"I did tweak my back a little bit" before Saturday's game, Posada said. "I took that as an excuse, to tell you the truth."

Posada was not in the starting lineup Sunday night. Andruw Jones was the Yankees' designated hitter, and Russell Martin started at catcher.
