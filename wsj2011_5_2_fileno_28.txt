ATHENS—The Greek government outlined Monday a three-year plan to crack down on chronic tax evasion, hoping it will bring €11.8 billion ($17.46 billion) in additional revenue by 2013. 

"Tax evasion is a heavy crime against the country and one of the most serious forms of social injustice," Finance Minister  George Papaconstantinou said at a news conference. 

The government is pushing through a raft of new measures to overhaul its dysfunctional and sometimes corrupt tax system, some of which have been implemented already. 

The measures aim to use technology more effectively to stop tax evasion, reduce the scope of corruption in tax audits, and make tax collection more effective. 

In May last year, Greece narrowly avoided default with the help of a €110 billion bailout from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. In exchange for that loan, the Greek government has pledged to cut its budget deficit to below 3% of gross domestic product by 2014 from a record 15.6% of GDP in 2009. 

Since then the country has managed to cut its 2010 deficit by about a third, to 10.5% of GDP, despite consistent shortfalls in revenue collections that have failed to meet budgeted targets. 

Citing various international studies, the government says the country's untaxed shadow economy is equal in size to between 25% and 37% of the total economy. 

Greece has an annual GDP of about €230 billion. Based on current figures, the government estimates tax evasion costs the country €15 billion per year.
