Mumbai --India's Infrastructure Development Finance Co. Ltd plans to raise 2.5 billion rupees by selling bonds, two people familiar with the matter said. 

The state-run lender to the infrastructure sector plans to sell 15-year bonds with a call option at the end of 10 years, the people, who declined to be named, told Dow Jones Newswires. 

The note, which will be privately placed, will pay a yield of 9.33% at par, they said, without specifying what the money would be used for. 

The company may raise an additional unspecified amount if bids exceed the issue size of 2.5 billion rupees, they said.
