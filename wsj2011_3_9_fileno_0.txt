  Q: I am tired of pencil skirts. I have a waistline and wide hips, and I look better in a gathered or pleated skirt. I am finally seeing skirted shirtwaist dresses in stores. What ideas can you give me?  

— M.A., Chevy Chase, Md. 

A: Unlike tight pencil skirts, the full-skirted silhouette is forgiving and flattering to many women—not to mention youthful. So why aren't full skirts more ubiquitous? 

My theory: Straight dresses and pencil skirts are easier to manufacture and thus more profitable to sell. Just think: A shirtwaist dress needs to be fitted through the bustline and torso, often with an set-in waist, and is attached to a skirt that is probably gathered or pleated. Inexpensive versions always seem to be somewhat off. Some are too short-waisted. Others lack a fitted bodice. 

Yet this spring, apparel makers seem to be offering more shirtwaist variations. I've spotted versions online from Anthropologie, Jones New York, Michael Kors and Ann Taylor, for instance. 

Beware of the too-full skirt, with so much gathered fabric that you look like a wide lampshade. Narrower, twist-front shirt dresses or those with gored, bias-cut panels won't do that. The fuller the skirt, the more important it is that the dress is made of a crisp, sturdy fabric such as silk or rayon faille. Portrait or scoop necklines and short sleeves look very pretty against this hourglass silhouette. 

You can go retro (à la TV mom June Cleaver) by wearing a light crinoline petticoat that makes the skirt bell out gently across the bottom. You don't need stilettos: A tapered medium-height heel in a neutral shade will look light on your feet, as will low-slung ballet flats.
