JUPITER, Fla.â€”After a morning workout, Oliver Perez left the Mets' clubhouse shortly before noon Sunday. Halfway to his car, he stopped and sat on a picnic table near the parking lot, seemingly unsure whether to go home or stay a bit longer.

The decision will be made for him soon enough.

Mets officials will huddle Monday morning to discuss the fate of their beleaguered, $36 million left-hander. And while Perez remained in limbo Sunday, all indications are that he will be released.

There wasn't a hint of support for Perez in the Mets' clubhouse after his dreadful performance in an exhibition game Saturday in Port St. Lucie. And he was not listed among the pitchers scheduled to throw in games Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.

That Perez was not released Sunday appeared to have more to do with logistics than anything else. General manager Sandy Alderson was in Lake Buena Vista for a split-squad game Saturday. And manager Terry Collins had to catch a 9:30 a.m. bus for a game in Jupiter on Sunday, leaving little time to meet with Alderson and ax Perez.

"We talked on the phone, but again, we want to sit down and continue the discussion," Collins said.

Perez was booed when he entered Saturday's game against the Washington Nationals. And the jeers only grew louder when the ball left his hand. He served up two home runs, allowed a single and walked a batter on four pitches. His spring training ERA ballooned to 8.38.

Given that Alderson cited fans' distaste for Luis Castillo when the Mets released him Friday, cutting Perez should be an easier decision. Perez is more unpopular than Castillo. And the other candidates for the left-handed relief job, Tim Byrdak and Mike O'Connor, have outpitched Perez. "We have other guys in here that are working hard and doing a good job from the left side," pitching coach Dan Warthen said.
