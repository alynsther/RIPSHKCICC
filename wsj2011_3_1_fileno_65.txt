MUMBAI â€“ India will miss the current fiscal year's target of raising 400 billion rupees ($8.8 billion) by selling stakes in state-run companies but will aim to mobilize the same amount in the next fiscal year, Finance Minister  Pranab Mukherjee said Monday. 

"The government will raise about 221.44 billion rupees from disinvestment in 2010-11," Mr. Mukherjee said in the annual federal budget speech in parliament in New Delhi. "I intend to maintain the momentum of the disinvestment [process] in 2011-12 by raising 400 billion rupees." 

The federal government intends to use the proceeds raised from the divestment program to reduce its fiscal deficit and invest in social and infrastructure projects. 

Mr. Mukherjee said that higher-than-anticipated non-tax revenue, including receipts from the sale of radio bandwidth to telecom operators for third-generation services, led the government to reschedule some proposed share sales this fiscal year through March. 

He reiterated that the government is committed to retaining at least 51% ownership and management control of state-run companies as he had stated earlier in his budget speech in February 2010. 

So far this fiscal year, the government has sold stakes in power producer SJVN Ltd., Engineers India Ltd., Coal India Ltd., Power Grid Corp. of India Ltd., miner MOIL Ltd. and Shipping Corp. of India Ltd. 

The government is also looking to sell stakes in Oil & Natural Gas Corp. and Steel Authority of India Ltd., among other companies.
