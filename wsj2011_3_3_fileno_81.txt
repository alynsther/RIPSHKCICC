The Tribeca Film Festival on Wednesday announced that the world premiere of Cameron Crowe's documentary "The Union" will open the event's 2011 edition, with a free performance by the film's subject, Elton John, to follow the film. The outdoor screening is slated to kick off the festival's 10th edition on April 20 at the North Cove at the World Financial Plaza. The festival will run through May 1.

"The Union" centers on the recent collaborative album of the same name by Mr. John and his early career idol, songwriter Leon Russell. Begun in November 2009, the filming captures the entire writing and recording process of the album. 

"It's a special opportunity to open our 10th Festival in this distinct and unique way," said Jane Rosenthal, the festival's co-founder, in a statement. "To have Elton, whose music transcends generations, perform after is an extraordinary gift to our festival and more specifically the downtown community." 

The festival will announce its feature film slate on Monday and on March 14. Tickets will be $16 for evening and weekend screenings, and $8 for daytime weekday and late-night screenings. Advance selection ticket packages and passes go on sale for American Express cardmembers on Monday, and on the following Monday for the general public. They can be purchased online at tribecafilm.com, or by phone (866) 941- 3378.

Founded by Ms. Rosenthal, Robert De Niro and Craig Hatkoff in 2001 following the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, the festival aims to bolster the economic and cultural revitalization of lower Manhattan. Since its inaugural edition in 2002, it has screened more than 1,100 films.
