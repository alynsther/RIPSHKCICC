HONG KONGâ€” PetroChina Co., China's biggest listed oil producer by output, said Thursday its net profit rose 35% in 2010 after strong energy demand outweighed lower refining margins. 

The Beijing-based company said it plans to increase oil-and-gas output 5.4% this year. Part of the rise was due to its previous overseas expansion, spurred by China's dependency on energy imports. 

Net profit for the 12 months ended Dec. 31 was 139.99 billion yuan ($21.3 billion), up from 103.39 billion yuan in 2009. The result was in line with an average the 133.09 billion yuan forecast by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. 

Revenue rose 44% to 1.465 trillion yuan from 1.019 trillion yuan, boosted by higher contributions from the upstream exploration-and-production segment. 

Despite the strong performance, PetroChina still failed to match the hefty gains posted by global rivals such as  ExxonMobil Corp.

 and  Royal Dutch Shell PLC. Global oil majors have demonstrated the industry's ability to recover quickly from the global economic slowdown by passing along higher crude-oil prices to consumers at the pump, while PetroChina has less room to maneuver. 

Last year, high crude costs squeezed refining margins at China's major refiners, PetroChina and  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., or Sinopec, as China's domestic fuel-pricing system prevented them from fully passing on higher raw-material costs to motorists and other oil consumers. 

PetroChina, which is listed in Hong Kong and Shanghai, said it expects to raise its crude-oil output 3.3% to 885.8 million barrels this year in response to strong domestic demand. 

In addition, the company plans to raise its 2011 capital spending 27% to 350.6 billion yuan from 276.2 billion yuan in the previous year. 

Operating profit in the firm's exploration-and-production businesses surged to 153.7 billion yuan from 105.02 billion yuan, due to the average selling price of its crude oil jumping 35% to $72.93 a barrel from $53.90. 

However, operating profit from PetroChina's refining business fell to 7.85 billion yuan from 17.31 billion yuan due to rising fuel costs. 

PetroChina and Sinopec are often under pressure from the Beijing government not to make any price adjustments so as not to boost inflation. China last adjusted prices for diesel and gasoline Feb. 20, raising gasoline and diesel prices by 4.1% and 4.5%, respectively. 

Although China's oil-demand growth is set to slow this year from 2010 levels, it will likely be stronger than other major economies such as the U.S. and Europe. Coupled with North Sea Brent oil prices hovering near two-year highs, many analysts expect PetroChina's profit to rise further this year. 

PetroChina's 2011 net profit is likely to rise to 149.9 billion yuan, according to a poll of 15 analysts by Thomson Reuters. 

Crude oil was trading Thursday near $99 a barrel, off recent highs of close to $120 a barrel due to unrest in the Middle East and North Africa, particularly Libya, where nearly one million barrels a day of crude production was forced offline. 

PetroChina has been on a spending spree to expand its global presence. Its latest overseas acquisition came in February when it entered into a 5.4 billion Canadian dollar (US$5.43 billion) deal with  EnCana Corp.

 to develop natural-gas reserves in Canada. 

Also in February, it created the PetroChina Overseas Planning & Research Center to oversee the planning of its overseas-business strategy and conduct preliminary studies on foreign storage and refining projects.
