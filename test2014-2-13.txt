An emphasis on fewer menu items and fewer company-owned restaurants helped
push Burger King Worldwide Inc.'s fourth-quarter earnings up 37%.

The fast-food chain lowered costs in 2013 by selling 360 of its restaurants to
franchisees. Burger King also slowed the introduction of new menu items. In
the past it rolled out numerous new products each quarter, but executives
decided recently to focus on fewer products that it thinks will have...

BUENOS AIRES—Argentina released a new measure of inflation on Thursday aimed
at assuaging critics who accused the government of President Cristina Kirchner
of lying about the data.

Under the new calculation, the January consumer-price index rose 3.7% on the
month, according to the national statistics agency Indec, a reading that isn´t
far from independent estimates. According to private forecasts compiled by
opposition legislators,...

SEOUL—South Korea has addressed U.S. concerns about letting a Chinese
telecommunications company develop the country's advanced wireless network by
agreeing to route sensitive U.S. and South Korean communications over separate

China's inflation remained tepid in January, but economists said the country's
central bank still has little room to ease monetary policy as concerns over
growing debt overshadow slowing economic growth.

China's consumer-price index rose 2.5% year-over-year, data released by the
National Bureau of Statistics on Friday showed, matching December's pace.
Economists had expected a slightly lower figure, but on Friday said

The Knicks entered the All-Star break with yet another deflating loss in
what's already been an unimaginably painful season. But if there's one thing
the team can look forward to during its week off, it's that Carmelo Anthony
might finally get some rest. (At least, when he's not playing in the All-Star
Game.)

Yes, Anthony is shooting well from the field this season, and better than ever
from three-point range. His assist rate is up, and his turnover percentage is
down. He's getting a higher percentage of steals and blocks. And he's
rebounding better than he ever has in his 11-year career.

But he's also playing an NBA-leading 38.8 minutes per game, and as Knicks fans
have plainly seen recently—including on Wednesday, when he missed all five of
his shots, including a layup, in overtime against Sacramento—Anthony's all-
around effort is leaving him exhausted at the end of games when the Knicks
need him most.

Anthony is almost always at his best early in games. This season, he's
shooting a blistering 51.1% in first quarters. But like clockwork, he is
running out of gas late, shooting just 36.7% in fourth quarters. (That
discrepancy has been even worse in February, with Anthony shooting 56% in
first quarters and 36% in fourth quarters.)

Of the NBA's top 25 scorers this season, Anthony's 14.4% drop in field-goal
percentage from the first quarter to the fourth quarter is the steepest. In
fact, if you compare him to other players who have led the league in minutes
in the past 20 seasons, Anthony's shooting-percentage decrease from the first
to the fourth quarters is the biggest by far.

Whatever the cause, Anthony has come up empty nearly every time he's taken a
big shot in the past two years. This season, he has made just 8% (1-of-12) of
his potential game-winning or game-tying shots in the final 30 seconds—which
is even worse than last season, when he made 14% (1-of-7) of those shots.

Now consider that Anthony made an NBA-best 44.6% (29-of-65) of game-winning or
tying shots in the nine seasons from 2003-04 to 2011-12, according to Stats
LLC.

What's gone wrong in New York? Asked about Wednesday night's disastrous finish
against Sacramento, Anthony hinted that fatigue had set in, which might
explain why he went cold after a 17-point first quarter. He did, after all,
run a total of three miles in the game, according to SportVU player-tracking
technology.

"It could've been [fatigue]," said Anthony, who played 48 minutes and shot
just 1-of-8 from the fourth quarter onward. "But whether I was fatigued or
not, I don't think that's why I missed a wide-open layup."

Coach Mike Woodson, who played Anthony the entire second half and overtime
without a substitution, acknowledged leaving Anthony on the floor longer than
he wanted to. "That is a lot of minutes," he said. "But I didn't even get a
chance to give him a break based on how things were going into that fourth
quarter."

Equally concerning about Woodson's management of Anthony: A chronic lack of
creative play-calling in late-game scenarios.

It's not unusual for a team to rely on its star with the game on the line. But
it's become obvious that the Knicks will more often than not clear a path for
Anthony in the hope of getting him a jumper from the left side of the court.
Of those 19 potential game-winning or tying shots he has taken the past two
seasons, 14 have come from the left. And just one of them was closer than 10
feet from the basket, according to Stats LLC.

After the loss to Sacramento, Woodson said Anthony could have been more
aggressive than he was with his 16-foot jumper from the wing at the end of
regulation. "They couldn't foul him," Woodson said. "They'd already wasted
their foul, so I thought he could have gone a little quicker with it to try to
force the issue by putting it on the officials [to make a call]."

But considering all the energy Anthony had expended to that point in the
game—and the season—it's possible he was just too tired for one last drive to
the basket.

HOMS, Syria—The Syrian regime released some of the men detained upon

the relief mission marred by violence and detentions of hundreds of evacuees.

Valerie Amos, head of the U.N.'s global humanitarian relief operations, said
Thursday that the relief operation in Homs could only resume with the written
agreement of both sides of the Syrian civil war.

TAMPA, Fla.—The anticipation surrounding Hideki Irabu's Yankee debut in 1997
was unprecedented. Irabu wasn't the first Japanese pitcher to try his hand in
the major leagues (Hideo Nomo had joined the Dodgers in 1995), but he was the
first to try it with the Yankees, and the fan base demanded instant
excellence.

But Irabu's Yankee teammates were skeptical that he would be the savior Nomo
had been in Los Angeles. His rotation mate,...

SOCHI, Russia—A giant white glove with multicolored fingers rises above the
merchandise "superstore" at the Olympic Park here, an outsize advertisement
for a product meant to be Sochi's must-have souvenir.

But even if Olympic spectators wanted to shop for gloves with temperatures in
the mid-60s here this week, the Sochi Games have made it oddly difficult to
buy official merchandise.

The main Olympic Park features just one superstore, which is operated by
Russian retailer Bosco di Ciliegi, Sochi's primary Olympic licensee. The wait
to get inside is often an hour long and sometimes has been two hours.

[ ![](http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-

Merchandise stands at other Olympic locations are scarce, and can be hard to
spot—like a nondescript trailer at the extreme sports venue in the mountains
that looks almost identical to the ones used for food concessions and
restrooms.

In an age of hypercommercialization, it seems impossible that an event like
the Olympics would be under-merchandised. But this is Russia.

"We definitely underestimated the interest in this during the Games, and in
Russia generally," said  Olga Chernosvitova, Bosco's vice president of
marketing. "We didn't expect this demand. …It is far more than we would ever
have expected."

With a $51 billion investment in venues and infrastructure, Russia aimed high
when it came to building an Olympics-worthy facility. But the Sochi organizing
committee aimed surprisingly low when it came to licensing and merchandising.
A visitor might get the feeling that the Rolling Stones, if they played a
couple of weeks worth of dates at the Iceberg Skating Palace, would outpace
the venue's sales of Sochi 2014 merchandise.

Sochi organizers didn't comment on the size and scope of the merchandising
program or the difficulties consumers have faced buying souvenirs at the
Olympic Park.

The Sochi organizing committee has said it is aiming for retail sales of about
$500 million, which would bring it around $30 million in licensing revenue
from its 55 partners and a total of 5,000 products. Bosco—which is owned by
Russian mogul  Mikhail Kusnirovich—is the committee's central partner.

By contrast, the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics generated more than $50
million in licensing revenue for its organizing committee; and the 2012 London
Summer Olympics, with featured 10,000 licensed products, generated about $130
million in revenue for its organizers.

Ms. Chernosvitova said there were several reasons for the modest expectations
Bosco and the organizers set for Sochi. Russians "don't have as much of a
tradition to bring back a T-shirt from an event," she said.

The licensing business, she added, is generally less mature in Russia than in
the U.S. or Europe.

Bosco's expectations were on the money until just before the Games began last
week.

"It was almost like a switch" was thrown, Ms. Chernosvitova said. "Someone
just turned on the Games two or three days before."

"We can't keep up 100%," she added.

The superstore in the Olympic Park certainly was caught off guard. Bosco
planned to open just a third of the store for the first week of the Games,
with the rest opening later to serve the throngs expected during the hockey
competition.

But big crowds descended from the get-go, and they have been grouchy about the
relatively slim pickings they find after enduring the long wait to shop. The
rest of the store was opened a couple of days early.

Nikolai Klimov, a student from Murmansk, in Russia's north, visited the
superstore one afternoon this week. Mr. Klimov said he didn't find much of a
selection. He wanted to buy a track suit, but couldn't find his size. Colors
also were limited: blue was largely sold out, leaving purple and red.

"The prices are really high too," said his mother, Tatiana Klimov, adding that
she had seen a short red child's jacket inside for a whopping 24,000 rubles,
or about $682.

Instead, the family bought two backpacks—a red and a blue one—for 1,900 rubles
($54) each, "a normal price," Mrs. Klimova said.

"It's not worth the wait," said Sergei, a 55 year-old businessman from
Krasnodar who declined to give his last name after waiting an hour in line.
"It says 'superstore,' so it should be a special store, not something like
this," he said.

Of course, the Sochi merchandising program extends far beyond the Olympic Park
to the far reaches of Russia. About 50% of the sales are being rung up in
Moscow, the site of another superstore; about 15% of sales are in Sochi.

Ms. Chernosvitova predicts that Bosco will hit its sales targets regardless,
and perhaps exceed them. That's partly because some of the hottest-selling
items are pricey Russia team jackets, and the rainbow-like gloves are selling
briskly at about $14 a pair.

But with the crowds swelling as some of the higher-profile Olympic events
begin, Bosco is bracing for an even bigger challenge.

"We are as ready as we are," Ms. Chernosvitova said.

Hey, it's an authentic Russian experience: central planning, waiting in lines
and shopping for mostly scarce, poor quality goods. Just like shopping in 1964
in the old GUM department store in Moscow.  
  
I bet the Russian mafia could have made a killing (maybe even literally)
selling goods to the tourists.

Well, when you have an enterprise culture that was systemically beaten out of
the Russian people during the utterly destructive decades of the Soviet Union,
and a modern-day Russia which is reverting to statist oligarchy, what should

Sorry. This site does not accept the Cyrillic alphabet.  
  
In 1964 the standard of living in the post-war USSR and Europe was almost no
different. Look old movies. They drove on similar cars, dressed in similar
clothes. And this is despite the incommensurate damages and casualties during
the war. There is such a fact. Food stamps have been canceled in the USSR in
1946 (not in 1945 only because of the drought in 1945). But in Britain, that
has suffered disproportionately less, only in 1954. I bet you did not know
about it. Just like about very much other things....

Most host countries want to promote every aspect of their culture and also use
merchandise sales to offset the costs of hosting the games.  
  
It's also a major political event. Berlin - 1936, Munich - 1972, Moscow -
1980, Los Angeles - 1984 are remembered as much for politics as any sports.
Aside from Jesse Owens, Ralph Metcalf and couple of others, no one is likely
to recall the names of medalists in Berlin. Munich is remembered for its
massacre of the Israelis by terrorists and the jobbing of the U.S. basketball
team. Moscow and L.A. are remembered for reciprocating boycotts. And of
course, South Africa and its apartheid policies were a factor in several
Olypmics.

I like when interlocutor knows the history!  
  
But, you forgot that in 1936 there were not only winter Olympic Games but the
summer Olympics too. Both in Nazi Germany! And the West had no claims to these
both Olympics. )))  
Russia(USSR) was engaged in own problems therefore did not participate in
games and was not presented in the IOC of that time.  
  
So, tell me (and to all present): is this article(the same as almost
everything on this site) just a promoting of rusophobia? And nothing else?

**CENTURIES OF CRAFTSMANSHIP** may have made Europe's great luxury labels indomitable, but newness is what drives fashion. Brands like Céline, Hermès, Prada and Louis Vuitton have long served as incubators for talent, giving design assistants access to some of the most hallowed sources of technical and commercial knowledge. Besides learning the craft, these protégés are also taught how to innovate within the confines of a brand's DNA. "It's a subtle way of designing," said jewelry designer Annelise Michelson, who previously worked at Hermès. "You have to be creative with something that is very classic." Ultimately, that experience can help focus their own independent lines. In the past few years, a number of designers with big-name credentials, like Ms. Michelson, have set out on their own. Here, five labels worth getting to know.

Looks from Andrea Pompilio spring 2014 collection

Menswear | **Andrea Pompilio**

If Andrea Pompilio's printed blazers and chunky brogues look like the kind of
thing some men would wear on a fun night out, that might be because the
Italian designer gets inspiration from observing small flourishes of self-
expression in bars, restaurants and in the streets.

Mr. Pompilio's career as an independent designer began auspiciously—his 2011
debut collection earned him the Who Is On Next award in the Italian design
talent competition at the Pitti Immagine trade show. The designer, 33, chalked
his success up to his experience at the fashion industry's "military
academies." Mr. Pompilio cut his design teeth under Neil Barrett working on
Prada's menswear and under Tom Ford when he was designing Yves Saint Laurent,
before going it alone.

"We think he has all the potential to become a renowned Italian designer for
menswear," said Alessandra Rossi, commercial director for luxury e-commerce
company Yoox Group. "He is able to give a new twist to menswear classics,
reinventing and combining new silhouettes, textiles, colors and prints."

Mr. Pompilio's wares are not for the shy or conventional dresser. He describes
his ideal customer as a "madman." He added, "I'm thinking of a soul [that is]
full of energy, who lives as a protagonist and isn't afraid of being in the
spotlight."

Jewelry | **Annelise Michelson**

One of the first jewelry designers to devise the full ear cuff—an adornment
that fits onto the ear's outer curve—Annelise Michelson was surprised at how
her strange, new spike-edged bijoux quickly gained popularity. "I thought
[most] people wouldn't understand it. Maybe eccentric people and stylists…,"
said Ms. Michelson, who launched her collection in 2010. "But it became a hit
and a lot of very [classically inclined] people wear it."

After graduating from Paris's Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture
school—known for its emphasis on high-end technique—Ms. Michelson, 29, worked
locally at a variety of French brands, including Hermès. "I learned a lot
about the luxury industry and handcraft skills," she said. "You need those
experiences to have your own company, but I knew I couldn't work for someone
else all my life."

Ms. Michelson's creative independence has since found its expression in five
varied and inventive collections. She's created dainty collars made from
silicone-coated lace; sensuous metal pieces that appear to be melting into the
wearer's skin; and a collection for men. It's no wonder she's found fans in
fashion-lovers ranging from Lady Gaga to the Kills' singer Alison Mosshart and
Man Repeller blogger Leandra Medine. Since last year, she has made inroads in
the U.S. Her wares are now stocked in boutiques in New York and Miami—a trans-
Atlantic exchange that she finds completely natural. "My jewelry is very
French. I do all my production in Paris with people working in the Place
Vendôme," she said. "But American women really get the feeling of my line."

Handbags | **Kzeniya**

An admirer of architect Zaha Hadid's futuristic forms, Ukrainian designer
Kzeniya Oudenot gives her bags a space-age glamour. Her sculptural clutches
often have cartoonishly oblique angles and tough-chic adornments.

Ms. Oudenot, 30, had something of a dream job with Alexander McQueen in 2006,
researching embellishments, dyes and prints. "When I was studying, McQueen was
one of my biggest inspirations," she explained. Her most valuable experience
was when the late designer would suddenly—thrillingly—discard Ms. Oudenot's
efforts. "We'd be working on one idea and he'd come in and say 'We're changing
everything,' " she recalled. "It was nice to see how open-minded you need to
be to come up with new ideas."

Ms. Oudenot launched her label in 2010. It is now stocked in 13 countries,
producing around 1,000 bags a year in limited editions for luxury department
stores like Selfridges and Harvey Nichols, as well as capsule collections of
more youthful styles for mass-market retailers like Urban Outfitters. Now
running her own small team, Ms. Oudenot said that she tries not to change
things at the last minute but reserves the right to do so.

Knitwear | **Le Moine Tricote**

To showcase her fall 2013 collection, Paris-based designer Alice Lemoine
photographed Joffrey Ballet dancer Jenny Sandler performing airborne
arabesques while wearing Ms. Lemoine's sculptural knitwear, which swirled
around her.

Choosing a ballerina as model made perfect sense. The garments Ms. Lemoine,
28, has produced since 2011 under her label, Le Moine Tricote, evoke movement
with flaring skirts and peplums, and gracefully tailored waists.

The French native began researching handknits in 2009 when she started working
for Rick Owens on his Palais Royal line. The designer hired Ms. Lemoine full
time after seeing her graduate collection at Parisian fashion school Esmod.
"It was a real laboratory," she recalled of her time in Mr. Owens's studio. "I
had an atelier with a lot of wool and could use the kitchen to dye, to boil,
to burn things."

Ms. Lemoine's designs are still driven by curiosity. She knits intuitively,
creating swatches with various textures, then positioning them on a fit model.
However, she also learned from Mr. Owens the importance of bringing creativity
to heel. "When you're a young designer, you always want to show that you can
do a lot," she said. "[Many] young designers do something completely different
each season, and we cannot understand who they are. When I started to do my
knits, Rick said, 'You've done half the work: You have found what you are good
at. Now you have to try to develop this, but don't change.' "

Looks from Cédric Charlier spring 2014 collection

Womenswear | **Cédric Charlier**

Cédric Charlier's work history reflects a wide aesthetic spectrum, ranging
from the fresh-scrubbed glamour of Michael Kors at Céline to the smoky French
sophistication of Alber Elbaz at Lanvin. In 2009, he was hired as artistic
director at French label Cacharel, where he explored that brand's girlish
heritage.

But when Mr. Charlier, 34, launched his eponymous label in 2012, he settled on
sleek simplicity. The Belgian designer said he sees himself as part of a new
generation defined by restraint. "Before, [fashion] was about excess," he
said. "Everything was too shiny, too expensive, maybe too much of the
designer's self-expression. Now, we are more about accuracy."

Accuracy, however, needn't be boring. Mr. Charlier's tailoring is sharply
inventive, as are his prints—paint-smeared, crackled, marbled—and provocative
color mixes. "I'm interested in sophistication, but I like when it's
subversive," he said, citing Tilda Swinton and Charlotte Rampling as ideal
customers. His time with Mr. Elbaz, said Mr. Charlier, taught him to "never
forget to see the personality of the woman more than the dress."

This month Mr. Charlier will open a pop-up shop at French department store
Printemps and will offer a less expensive capsule collection via French
catalog company La Redoute.

Aquazzura Carlo Furgeri Gilbert for The Wall Street Journal

Footwear | **Aquazzura**

An ultrafeminine strappy sandal might not sound revolutionary, but in 2011,
when Edgardo Osorio founded his brand, it was. The prevalent shoe at the time
was a hefty platform pump. "Nobody was making beautiful, modern shoes that a
woman could actually walk in and not look ridiculous," he says.

To fill that void, Mr. Osorio, 28, launched Aquazzura, which did away with
overly conceptual design and heavy soles. "My shoes aren't minimalist," he
says, "but they are about a new simplicity."

The Colombian native studied accessory design at Central St. Martins in
London, and consulted for brands like Rene Caovilla and Sigerson Morrison
before taking a post as the shoe designer at Roberto Cavalli in 2009. "I got
to meet the most incredible people that laser-cut and print leather," says Mr.
Osorio of his time at the Italian brand. That experience was certainly a boon
when he decided to launch his line. "I knew the best factories and tanneries."

Aquazzura's reputation began to take shape when fashion editor Giovanna
Battaglia wore a cutout suede sandal from his debut collection during Paris
fashion week. "It's the shoe that began the success of my brand," says Mr.
Osorio. "It encompassed everything I wanted to communicate." Within a year and
a half, Aquazzura was available in 35 countries. Mr. Osorio says both his
sales and staff tripled last year, and that success seems likely to continue.
"We're forecasting to do over 50,000 pairs next year," he says.

MEXICO CITY—Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto gave his backing Thursday to
the country's newly created telecommunications regulator after broadcaster
Grupo Televisa SAB legally challenged the regulator's authority to order the
free distribution of its channels on pay-television systems.

The Federal Telecommunications Institute, or IFT, sought the intervention of
the president after a Mexico City judge notified the institute this week that
it doesn't have the power to order the free transmission of Televisa channels,

MARKETS AT A GLANCE

(Data as of approximately 5 p.m. ET)

...

Updated Feb. 13, 2014 7:12 p.m. ET

**LAST SUMMER**, with a new baby in tow, instead of meeting friends for a drink we would invite them over for a lunchtime picnic. One of the best tips I received from a sommelier about entertaining at home is to have the wine open and ready before your guests arrive. Once they are over the threshold, simply hand them a glass. Last summer, it was bone-dry Riesling from the Pfalz, Germany's driest and sunniest wine region. It went down a treat, particularly when I revealed its price.

I'm sure if I had given my friends the option of a dry German Riesling, a New
Zealand Sauvignon Blanc or a California Chardonnay, they would have plumped
for the last two every time. Therein lies Riesling's problem—it's hopelessly
unfashionable. Will it ever become fashionable? Who knows and, really, for
those who love it (and I urge you all to love it), who cares? So long as it
remains out of fashion, its price will continue to be very attractive.

[ ![](http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-
BM894_DN0213_D_20140213092451.jpg) ENLARGE  ](/news/interactive/DN0213)

I love dry Riesling from Alsace and Germany, but there is another country on
the wine map that arguably makes some of the best examples in the world:
Australia. When you think of Australia, you naturally think of big, expressive
Shiraz blends or creamy, oaked Chardonnay, so it's easy to overlook the fact
that Riesling is one of the country's principal grape varieties.

The ancient German variety was introduced into Australia in the early 19th
century by Central Europeans. It found a natural home in South Australia
where, in the Clare and Eden valleys, it acquires floral notes of lime and a
searing, pinpointed acidity that when young is firm and bracing and, compared
with counterparts in Germany, very dry. With age, these wines evolve to give
more toasty notes.

This steely, dry style is achieved by two means. One is by planting at
altitude; the Eden and Clare valleys are actually areas of quite high, open
land, which enjoy relatively cool evenings in the growing season. The other
factor is that the must is put through a full fermentation, thereby burning
off any residual sugar.

But perhaps more than any other grape variety, Riesling is defined by the soil
it is grown on. In Germany, this is primarily schist, slate and granite, which
you can almost taste as you chew the wine in your mouth. In the Clare and Eden
valleys, we find a mixture of soils, including limestone and slate, which goes
some way to explain the success of the variety there.

Australian specialist writer Matthew Jukes argues that these vineyards produce
the best dry Rieslings in the world. Wineries such as Dandelion Vineyards,
Grosset, Kilikanoon, Langmeil, Leeuwin, Mac Forbes, Mount Horrocks, Pewsey
Vale, Pikes and Wynns are all worth looking out for.

That these wines are undergoing something of a renaissance is also down to
their compatibility with food, especially the lighter Asian dishes that are so
popular in Australia just now. Chef  Roger Jones, founder of the Michelin-
starred Harrow in Little Bedwyn, U.K., lists more than 300 Australian wines in
his restaurant. He says ingredients like chili and ginger are a natural
pairing with Australian off-dry Riesling as the spice takes away the natural
kerosene perfume of the wine.

Which brings me back to entertaining at home. I always like to serve an off-
dry Riesling with a fresh crab and chili dish as a first course. I pour out
the wine and watch the reaction as the sweetness interacts with the food. I
find the residual sugar always lifts the mood. Do I tell them what's in the
glass? Only after they've tasted it.

**ON THE SECOND FLOOR **of Yay contemporary art gallery, a two-story sandstone structure in Baku, the artist  Faig Ahmed is peeling bubble wrap off several medium-size carpets hung in frames. The top half of one rug resembles the centuries-old weaving tradition that's helped make his native country, Azerbaijan, famous across the Caucasus. Outside, vendors are hawking similar patterns to tourists in the _Ichari Shahar_, or Old City, a nest of cobbled streets, mosques and caravan stops at the capital's medieval center. In 2000, the entire walled area was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site, though gazing toward the palace of the Islamic Shirvanshah dynasty—the gallery's terrace overlooks the ruin of the royal hammam—one can also see the 600-foot Flame Towers arcing up from the hills ringing the city, three curvilinear structures outfitted with 10,000 LED lights that blaze, at night, like enormous licks of fire.

Ahmed, 31, has a pointy beard and almond-shaped eyes. Scanning down the
carpet, something interesting begins to happen. Each decorative
flourish—ancient symbols, he explains, for horses, birds, dragons—begins to
pixilate and then dissolve into blurred blocks of color. The artwork turns out
to be a clever deconstruction of traditional craft, incorporating digital
disruption into the literal fabric of its design. (Ahmed spent months finding
artisans who would undertake the laborious process of hand-weaving his
tradition-meets-tech designs.) With its provocative blend of rich historicism
and hyper modernity, the carpet is also a potent symbol of Baku itself.
Pointing at the rug, he says, "There are some things we are used to seeing,
and when they change you can feel how strange it is—suddenly, change is here."

Azerbaijan's ancient capital curves along a crescent-shaped bay on the Caspian
Sea. If the country has a single defining characteristic, it's an ability to
harmoniously absorb diverse cultural influences. Its tangled traffic is
comprised of Soviet-make Ladas, Mercedes S-Classes and purple London-style
taxis nicknamed "aubergines." Women like to wear their hair waist-length while
men opt for western jeans paired with traditional flourishes: a beard, a
skullcap, prayer beads. (Like its southerly neighbor, Iran, the country is
predominately Shia Muslim.) Baku's spate of recently opened luxury
shops—Céline, Dior,  Tom Ford—are clustered along a waterfront byway called
Neftchilar Avenue that's also home to fin de siècle oil-boom mansions, Soviet
government buildings and an imposing 12th-century stone landmark known as the
Maiden Tower.

Situated at the base of the Caucasus Mountains, Azerbaijan has been conquered
over the millennia by Alexander the Great, the Mongols, the Ottomans, the
Persians and the Russians. It has been squeezed between East and West, old and
new, Islam and Christianity, Europe and Asia for so long that to say it exists
at a cultural crossroads—as people have for centuries—is to resort to cliché.

Only during its very recent history has Azerbaijan's cross-cultural
flourishing been put on hold. In 1991, along with most of the former USSR,
Baku emerged from more than 50 years of repressive communist rule, an era that
replaced the city's syncretic broadmindedness with monolithic totalitarianism.
Since the thaw—and for the second time in its long history—Azerbaijan has been
applying its petro dollars to become an economic engine for the region. Its
cultural capital is rising, too.

Ruled for the past decade by President  Ilham Aliyev, who inherited the
presidency from his father and one-time KGB general  Heydar Aliyev, the
current government has been accused of corruption, holding unfair elections
and limiting free speech. "Unfortunately, corruption exists in every society
around the world and the government of Azerbaijan is making every effort to
address this problem in Azerbaijan," says Fakhraddin Ismayilov, press attaché
at the Embassy of the Republic of Azerbaijan. Rights groups and analysts say
that much of the country's corruption is related to revenues from the state-
run oil industry—some of which Aliyev uses to fund the ongoing Nagorno-
Karabakh War with bordering Armenia. (Other potentially hostile neighbors are
Iran and Russia, which has become increasingly assertive in its sphere of
influence.) Azerbaijan has taken several concrete steps toward democratic
reform, such as joining the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, a
global coalition of governments, companies and NGOs working to create
accountability for revenues stemming from natural resources.

It's impossible to overstate the importance of oil to Azerbaijan. At the turn
of the last century, when Baku's population growth outpaced that of London and
New York, the city was a heady blend of European metropolis and Wild West
frontier. It was known for its Philharmonic Hall, inspired by Monte Carlo's
grand casinos, which housed the first opera house in the Muslim world. The
Rothschilds and the Nobel brothers built opulent mansions underwritten by
fortunes made from Azeri oil, as did dozens of Muslim "oil barons," who
aspired to transform Baku into the grandest city in the Islamic world through
civic philanthropy. As the writer  Tom Reiss details in The Orientalist,
Azerbaijan thought of itself as Europe's easternmost outpost—even if the rest
of Europe didn't necessarily know it. "Even today it is possible to imagine
that one has wandered into some unusually sooty Right Bank neighborhood in
Paris, mysteriously abandoned by its inhabitants," writes Reiss.

Though efforts to restore the country to its pre-Soviet stature began
immediately after the Iron Curtain lifted, the pace of regeneration has hit
warp speed in the last few years. On the one hand, the government is pouring
millions of dollars into civic improvements, much of it tellingly centered on
cultural infrastructure like the recently opened Zaha Hadid–designed Heydar
Aliyev Center. The concert hall and exhibition space resembles a swooping
space-age Bedouin tent perched on a hill, its sinuous design a reference to
Islamic calligraphy. There's also the soon-to-open relocation of the State
Museum of Azerbaijan Carpet and Applied Art, the design of which evokes a
massive rolled-up rug.

While architectural pyrotechnics like the HOK-designed Flame Towers and the
Heydar Aliyev Center—both completed in 2012—serve as bids for international
attention, the not-for-profit arts organization Yarat is the force behind the
city's nascent but fast-growing contemporary art scene. Since its founding in
September 2011, Yarat has produced an astounding 42 projects, from "Love Me,
Love Me Not"—a special pavilion at the 55th Venice Biennale of art from
countries that share a border with Azerbaijan, including Iran, Turkey, Russia
and Georgia—to a site-specific exhibition of 29 emerging artists housed inside
the Baku Air Condition Plant. It has produced a pop-up film festival;
collaborations with galleries in New York, Paris and London; and an annual
Public Art Festival that last year brought the Dutch artist  Florentijn
Hofman's giant globe-trotting rubber ducky, previously moored in Hong Kong's
Victoria Harbour, to Baku.

"The idea was to have a group of artists who support each other, a platform
that puts everyone together," says Yarat's founder,  Aida Mahmudova, who plans
to move Yarat's current headquarters in the Old City to a multistory former
Soviet naval base in 2015. "You gather, and it's power already."

Part of Yarat's mandate is to promote Azerbaijani artists internationally as
well as at home. In September 2012, it helped organize the first Christie's
exhibition in Baku. "It was a combined exercise which showcased international
art alongside a very vibrant local art scene," says  Paul Hewitt, managing
director of growth markets at the auction house. "It was an important first
step of a developing relationship." Held at the Four Seasons, one of several
brand-new five-star hotels in the capital, the show featured works by
Picasso, Warhol and DeLempicka and was attended by a troop of high-powered
collectors from Mexico, China, Switzerland and India—a bellwether for a city
on the verge of becoming an art-world destination for the private jet set. At
the same time, Yarat opened the exhibition "Commonist," with works by its
artists, including Ahmed and 18 others.

NEW TRADITION | Aida Mahmudova, founder of Yarat, an organization dedicated to
the support and promotion of Azerbaijani artists Photography by Jamie
Hawkesworth for WSJ. Magazine

**AT THE CENTER** of this transformation is Mahmudova, a 32-year-old with a slight gym-toned frame and a broad smile who has become the link between official culture and subculture in Baku. Her aunt Mehriban Aliyeva is the country's first lady. Her cousin  Leyla Aliyeva (Mehriban's daughter) is the editor-in-chief of the Condé Nast–owned _Baku_ magazine, a glossy dedicated to all things luxurious in the capital. "The idea [for Yarat] came to me a long time ago, way before I founded the organization," she says. With her familial wealth and desire to help artists of all generations, she approximates a very young, very glamorous godmother of art.

Mahmudova is herself a commercially successful artist. After earning a degree
in fashion merchandising from the American InterContinental University, she
studied painting at London's prestigious Central Saint Martins. She says her
time in the British capital shaped her sense of how an arts organization in
Baku might be structured. But it wasn't until after she'd finished school in
London, married an Iranian entrepreneur and had a daughter, now 3 years old,
that she focused her energies on getting the organization off the ground.

Moving back to Baku in 2010, she became close with other young artists—such as
Ahmed and  Farid Rasulov, who creates life-size installations out of carpets
and surreal plastic animals. Together, they realized there was no single
organization in Baku for artists looking to show work or collaborate—much less
gain international traction. Furthermore, any such organization would have to
actively generate a homegrown audience for the kinds of abstract or conceptual
art they make, which looks radically unfamiliar to most Azerbaijani eyes. "I
wouldn't call it a plan," she says of Yarat's early days. "It was a dream and
a passion and then it turned into a reality. It was spontaneous, based on an
emotional level. Now, of course, we make plans two or three years ahead of
time."

"I think I'm really at the right place at the right time," she adds.  "The
whole country is emerging, for the West especially. It's opening up and it's
growing, and Yarat is growing at the same time."

Though she surely benefits from her family connections, Mahmudova is not
involved in politics—and given the controversy surrounding her aunt's husband,
she has every reason to downplay her political connections. She structured
Yarat as a not-for-profit, with a creative board made up of artists. Money is
raised by petitioning local businesses like banks and telecommunications
companies for support, typically for specific projects, like the Public Art
Festival, a citywide event that lasts six months and showcases several dozen
works of art. Yay gallery serves as the commercial wing of the organization,
with half of the profits going to the artist and the other half to Yarat,
which employs seven people full time.

Last December, Yarat held its first general fund-raiser, a presentation
followed by cocktails at the JW Marriott Absheron hotel. According to Davud
Gambarzade, Yarat's international program director, Azerbaijani companies are
beginning to recognize that being associated with the arts can have a positive
branding effect. Money that once went to chess competitions or sports like
wrestling—both popular in Azerbaijan—is now funding artistic patronage.

In 2012, for the Public Art Festival, Mahmudova made an artwork installed in
the Seaside Boulevard, a landscaped promenade that runs between the Caspian
Sea and Neftchilar Avenue. The work is derived from the ornate window frames
of an abandoned building across the avenue. Mahmudova rescued the frames and
repurposed them in a fragmented, paisley-like pattern, replacing the glass
with reflective material. The artwork, called _Recycled_, now shows a
splintered version of the new Baku. "Four years ago, I wasn't changing as fast
as I'm changing now. Everything was slower. It's crazy. And it's difficult,"
says Mahmudova. "Sometimes I don't like the fast changes, even inside
myself—but I can't help it because I change my surroundings and my
surroundings change me."

In 2013, Mahmudova was appointed curatorial director of the four-year-old Baku
Museum of Modern Art. Next year, she plans to narrow the scope of its rotating
exhibition space to focus on Azerbaijani artists, particularly emerging ones,
like the 34-year-old painter  Rashad Babayev.  Babayev's large-scale canvases
use color and shadow to create powerful abstract forms. Schooled as a lawyer,
he considers himself "street educated" by an older generation of artists such
as  Rasim Babayev (no relation), a Soviet-era painter whose politically
provocative work became nationally recognized only after his death. "I spent a
lot of time speaking with the artistic community, talking with other artists,
so I have a kind of training," says Rashad Babayev. He has been working with
Yarat since its inaugural group exhibition, "On Soz"—meaning "forward" in
Azeri.

The museum is perhaps the least ostentatious example of Baku's drive to build
blue-chip architecture. Though the city's construction frenzy draws
comparisons to Dubai and Abu Dhabi, Bakuvians recoil at the implications:
Where those Emirate cities often import a kind of rootless western
architecture, Baku's structures reference the country's cultural heritage.
Even the glittering Flame Towers are a nod to the country's past as a
spiritual center for Zoroastrians—practitioners of Persia's pre-Muslim
religion, who were drawn to the flames that still spontaneously erupt from the
landscape thanks to natural gas leaks.

Gas is unavoidable in Azerbaijan. The world's first mechanized rig struck big
here in 1871, and by 1901 the country's fields pumped half the world's crude.
The most powerful gushers were given names, such as Wet Nurse and Golden
Bazaar. During Soviet rule, the industry languished, but in 1994, Heydar
Aliyev signed the so-called Contract of the Century, a series of deals with
multinational energy companies that paved the way for Azerbaijan's offshore
oil fields to be developed, and returned vast, if unevenly distributed, wealth
to the county. The opening of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline in 2006 and a
gradual shift in resources from oil to natural gas are helping to keep the
industry strong. Early this year, Yay gallery showed a series of paintings
called _Girls Prefer Oilmen_ by the Russian-born painter  Irina Eldarova. The
works depict candy-colored versions of  [Marilyn
Monroe](http://topics.wsj.com/person/M/Marilyn-Monroe/6597) demurely flirting
with Azerbaijani rig workers.

**THE AVERAGE ART STUDENT** in Baku will graduate with excellent technical skills, learning to sculpt from life or paint in the Soviet Realist style that still dominates academic art. What's not on offer, however, is the kind of conceptual art that most western schools have favored over the last 50 or so years—art that considers process and ideas and may not even look like art to someone outside the field.

Yarat tries to address some of these gaps through its educational initiative,
Artim ("progress" in Azeri). Artim offers workshops, lectures and master
classes that are open to the public. "We try to add something that's missing,"
says Mahmudova. "Photographers have to take workshops outside of university,
so we teach that." Yarat also hosts international artists residencies, luring
working artists and professors from institutions like the Wimbledon College of
Art and the Royal College of Art in London. Last November, Mark Dunhill, the
dean of art at Central Saint Martins, held a four-day sculpture workshop at
the arts academy with his partner, Tamiko O'Brien. "What I think is good about
the Yarat foundation is that they are really serious about education and
trying to bring about change through changing the way people think about
things," says Dunhill. "Culture is a powerful force, and while it may not be
overtly political, I think that encouraging people to open their eyes to
different ways of seeing things is good, and I'm keen to support that."

There have been unmistakable successes for Yarat: The Venice pavilion; "Fly to
Baku," a traveling exhibition of Azerbaijani artists' work co-organized by the
high-profile Swiss auctioneer  Simon de Pury; "Merging Bridges," a 2012 show
at the Baku MoMA of work by Yarat-supported artists and international names
like  James Turrell, Idris Khan and Olympia Scarry; and Ahmed, who last year
was short-listed for the Victoria and Albert Museum's Jameel Prize 3 for
artists inspired by the Islamic tradition. This month, the exhibition "Love
Me, Love Me Not," which includes work by New York–based  Ali Banisadr and the
international collective Slavs and Tatars, travels from Venice to the Heydar
Aliyev Center's tiered galleries. At the same time, Yarat will travel to Art
Dubai as part of its Marker section, focused this year on Central Asia and the
Caucasus.

One chilly afternoon, Mahmudova visits the crumbling three-story studio space
she shares with Ahmed, Rasulov and other friends. "I'm just very tired
constantly because we've been working so hard for the past two years," she
says. There are dark stains on the floor where rainwater has overflowed from
wineglasses placed beneath leaks in the skylight. Canvases tilt against the
graffiti-covered walls. The voice of a man reciting passages of the Koran
drifts up from the street outside, where a Muslim funeral is taking place.

This is an older, less gentrified section of Baku, where the streets are
narrow and difficult to navigate. Mahmudova doesn't come here very often
anymore. She's set up a studio in her apartment across town, where she can
paint in the evenings when the mood strikes her and see her daughter anytime.
It's just as well. Soon, much of the neighborhood will succumb to
modernization, making way for a new highway or parkland or gleaming office
towers—monuments to Azerbaijan's future.

Azerbaijan is a hidden jewel. A very safe country with the most well mannered
people I have ever met; haggling at a local bazaar should be part of any sales
person curriculum; the locally grown food outranks the 'organic' food mania
(best tasting honey, best butter, best cucumbers, best tomatoes, best lamb,
you name it). Visit it before Walmart and other capitalistic filth arrives in
full swing. Bring cash; it isn't that cheap. The article is skewed towards the
arts, but there is a lot for a globe trekker to explore.

It is good to see the Azeri culture flourishing after the suffocating rule of
the Soviets, especially since the Azeri culture in neighboring Iran is still
suffocated by the mullahs.

SOCHI, Russia—In the hours after gold-medal favorite Shani Davis finished
nowhere near the podium, the U.S. speedskating team pored over data through
the early morning Thursday, questioning everything from race strategy to skate
blades.

After an equally disastrous outcome in the women's 1,000-meter race later on
Thursday, a suspect emerged: the high-tech racing suits the team adopted for
the Winter Olympics.

After a disastrous outcome for heavily favored U.S. men and women
speedskaters, a suspect has emerged: the high-tech Under Armour racing suits
the team adopted for the Winter Olympics. Joshua Robinson reports from Sochi
on Lunch Break. Photo: AP.

These suits—designed by apparel sponsor  [Under
Armour](http://quotes.wsj.com/UA)[ UA 2.07 % ](http://quotes.wsj.com/UA) and
billed before the Games as a competitive advantage—have a design flaw that may
be slowing down skaters, according to three people familiar with the U.S.
team.

Vents on back of the suit, designed to allow heat to escape, are also allowing
air to enter and create drag that keeps skaters from staying in the low
position they need to achieve maximum speed, these people said. One skater
said team members felt they were fighting the suit to maintain correct form.

Kevin Haley, the senior vice president of innovation for Under Armour, which
has sponsored the U.S. team since 2011, said he was confident the suits were
fast, but, in the absence of medal-winning performances, "we'll move heaven
and earth to make them better."

[ ![](http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-
BN347_sochig_NS_20140213185842.jpg) ENLARGE  ](http://graphics.wsj.com/sochi-
contest/?mg=inert-wsj)

Several skaters, including Heather Richardson, ranked No. 1 in the 1,000
meters, sent their suits to an Under Armour seamstress Thursday to have the
panel modified with an extra piece of rubber. After the alteration, Ms.
Richardson finished seventh—more than a second slower than the winner.

As of Thursday night, no American has finished better than seventh place in
any of the six long-track speedskating events held so far. Another six long-
track events remain. In the 2010 Vancouver Games, the U.S. won four medals in
speedskating.

"I would like to think that it's not the suit," said Mr. Davis, a two-time
gold medalist, who finished eighth in the 1,000 meter despite dominating this
season's World Cup circuit. "I would never blame the suit. I'd much rather
blame myself. I just wasn't able to do it today, but other people were."

####

Bert van der Tuuk, the designer of the Dutch Olympic team's suits, said
Thursday he had tried a similar ventilation panel on the back of a prototype
three years ago, but it slowed his skaters by letting in air and creating
drag. "The suit was blowing itself up," he said.

There were other possibilities. The U.S. team trained at higher altitudes on
an outdoor track in Collalbo, Italy, with ice conditions different from the
track in Sochi. Plus, said Brittany Bowe, the world-record holder in the 1,000
meters who finished eighth behind Ms. Richardson, "other countries are just
getting really fast."

Ted Morris, the executive director of USA Speedskating, said, "The evidence
does not suggest that the suits have contributed to the disappointing results
so far…We're working with our athletes, coaches, trainers and Under Armour to
figure out what we can do to produce better results for Team USA."

Matt Powell, an industry analyst for SportsOneSource, said the benefit of
Under Armour's sponsorship of the U.S. speedskating team at the Games is
global exposure and product credibility. The $11.5 billion Baltimore-based
sportswear maker went public in 2005 and derives its core business from sales
of performance apparel, rather than from sports footwear like Nike Inc. and
Adidas AG.

Under Armour developed the skintight aerodynamic suit for the Sochi Games and
it was pretested for specific conditions, including the sea-level altitude,
that athletes would face there. The company billed the so-called Mach 39
outfit as "the fastest speedskating suit in the world." The suits, made from
five synthetic fabrics, went through 300 hours of wind-tunnel testing and
incorporated the design expertise of Lockheed Martin's aircraft engineers, the
company said. Even the zippers were a special design.

The suits were delivered to the team in January, when preliminary adjustments
for fit and comfort were made for each athlete, Mr. Haley said. The company
also sent a team of specialists to Sochi to make adjustments as needed. The
U.S. team wore the suits in the past month for simulated race conditions, but
the Games marked the first time in competition.

The new U.S. suits were a topic of conversation among rival teams at the Adler
Arena's morning practice Thursday. Overhearing a conversation about them, a
Dutch coach shouted, "Are you talking about the suits? They're slower!"

[ ![](http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OG-
AA793_SOCHI__D_20140204163228.png) ENLARGE  ](http://olympics.wsj.com/)

U.S. national long-track team coach Ryan Shimabukuro declined to discuss the
suits or Under Armour. "I'm not going to criticize them, even if I was allowed
to," he said. "They're a great partner. And it'd be stupid to criticize a
company that has backed us completely."

This isn't the first time the U.S. speedskating team has had issues with an
experimental suit going into the Winter Olympics. In 2006, when the team was
sponsored by Nike, it reverted to older Nike suits before the Games.

Mr. Davis said his start in Wednesday's losing 1,000-meter race was one of the
fastest of his career. Normally after such a strong start, he said, "there's
no way, no way in hell, that I would post a 25.4 [second] lap."

On Saturday, Mr. Davis will compete in the 1,500-meter race, an event in which
he has twice won silver medals. But he tempered expectations for the longer
race. If the suit was the problem in the 1,000 meter, he said, "then it's
probably going to be worse because it's more laps to skate under the thing."

Peter Mueller, a one-time Olympic gold medal winner in the 1,000 meters who
went on to coach such U.S. greats as Bonnie Blair and Dan Jansen, said that a
suit affects a skater two ways. There is the impact on speed. And there is
comfort, which can affect a skater's confidence.

Mr. Mueller, who watched the race on TV, said he had never seen Mr. Davis
start so quickly. He couldn't explain why he slowed down, but he thought the
suit might have played a part.

"If I was Shani, I'd talk to Under Armour and I'd see if I could use my Nike
[suit] and put an Under Armour sticker on it."

I wonder of the lack of adequate testing of the new suits is an expression of
the same good old-fashioned paranoia we saw with the America's Cup race, where
the Yanks and Kiwis did everything short of having minisubs torpedo the scout
boats that they were using to snoop on each others' latest design tweaks.
Presumably Under Armour's competitors know how to use telephoto lenses.

This story apparently is about the American skaters trying to get an unfair
advantage in speed by using a "special" suit and now complaining that they
are, instead, getiing an unfair disadvantage!  
  
It's always something isn't? But whatever it is it's not the fault of the
person doing it.  
  
A perfect reflection of our times, it seems.  
  
By the way, why aren't all skaters required to wear the same suit so that no
one gets an advantage? Isn't this event about which skater is fastest, not
which suit is?  
  
One other thing, has anybody else noted that all these skaters with suits on
look like the sperm in Woody Allen's "Everything You Always Wanted to Know
About Sex, But Were Afraid to Ask"?

The whining among the Americans is a national embarrassment. Is this just a
manifestation of the culture (it's somebody else's fault; just trying is
supposed to get me a gold, like it did on the playground)?  
  
American Shaun White whined about [some facility], and withdrew, to focus on
other things. He ended up with zip. He'll be remembered for his whining.  
  
Now, "it's the suit's fault." They had plenty of time to figure out the suit.
These whiners aren't as good as they thought they were. Life is tough, when
you step outside the bubble.  
  
I hope the whiners watched Evgeny Pleshenko the other night. He's endured
multiple surgeries, and hadn't planned to compete this year (his 4th Olympic
competition). He didn't whine and moan. He just skated, for the last time as
it turned out (he was in pain and had to withdraw before the short program
today), helping his team win a gold. Beautiful. Gorgeous. Classy. World class.  
  
For the whiners, an old American proverb: man up!

I am not reading this in responses: why would the coaches have failed to have
our athletes practice for months in these same suits instead of having them
delivered and worn just before the games? To me if there is any issue it is
the failure of the coaching staff to test out the equipment well in advance of
the games. This is like having the Navy Seals practice for an assault with one
type of gun for months, then change guns two days before the assault.  
  
There may be something wrong with the suits, but I find it hard to believe. It
might be that the fit for some athletes is all wrong and the material has
stretch issues. Even so, the teams should have been practicing in this stuff
for months in advance.

Maybe, just maybe, Davis lost because there were other Olympic skaters that
were better that day. With the myriad of factors that go into a single
performance, cherry-picking just one to blame failure is sounding more and
more American (read - Obama) every day!

Do other countries use latex in their suits? Since the US has stopped using
latex nothing stretches like it used to. It is the lack of latex that has
caused women to abandon nylon stockings as just too uncomfortable. I would bet
that these suits have no latex and that the vents were added for ease of
motion as much as for cooling.

I've never been a speedskater, but as soon as an athlete can believe that
his/her equipment is the problem, it is near impossible to change that belief.
Conversely,, if you believed your equipment made you faster, there is no way
this will be attributed to your time, but if it's threatened to be taken away
--that's another story.

Wait a second. UA has time to consult with Lockheed aerospace engineers and
wind-tunnell test the suits, BUT there's no time to test them under
competitive conditions? What am I missing? Doesn't it seem like a bad idea to
go into battle with totally new gear?

"The U.S. team wore the suits in the past month for simulated race conditions,
but the Games marked the first time in competition."  
  
They had four years... why wait until the last minute, and have no testing
under competitive conditions if these suits are so important?  
  
Seems crazy. Is Obama running this show? Sure seems like it.

Be assured they were tested. More likely is that it is easier to blame a large

not meeting expectations.The ice skaters blame the suits, the half-pipe riders

Just because you have egghead PhD's sitting around dreaming these things up on
paper doesn't mean they will work. Most of these folks have never been on a

Suits do make a difference but it is much more likely that racers who peaked
perfectly are just winning. That is the nature of sport. It is rarely one
easily identifiable thing that will point out the loss, rather a series of
small mistakes that cascade as the race goes on.

I think it would surprise you how much a suit can impact the drag coefficient
at this level of competition. These speed skaters are traveling a high rate of
speed and it's the best athletes in the world. Take the same athlete and have
him run a lap wearing two different types of suits and he'll have different
times. Multiple that across many laps... and you are out of the medal if not
wearing the right suit.

Presumably the US coaches time the practice runs and would know well in
advance of the actual Olympic events if the whole team was slower as a result
of the new suits. The would also know if the best team members were slower. I
find this article very hard to believe.

This is the official ranking of the 2014 Winter Olympics:  
1\. Germany: 7 gold medals.  
2\. Switzerland: 5 gold medals  
3\. Canada: 4 gold medals, 5 silver.  
4\. Norway and US: 4 gold medals, 3 silver.  
  
Germany, Switzerland, Canada and Norway are smaller countries than US.

I don't doubt that the suit makes a difference. But if the suit can make a
difference, can't other things also make a difference? And if so, are we then
to believe that all those other things are equal in this case? It seems
implausible.  
  
Also it is perfectly normal for people to look around for something to blame
when things don't work out as expected. The only way to find out if the suits
are the problem is to conduct a randomized clinical trial under race
conditions. This should have been done before the American skaters were asked
to don these suits in competition.

The Allman Brothers Band was grieving in the fall of 1972. Their prior two
albums—"At Fillmore East" and "Eat a Peach"—had pioneered a new sound by
blending roadhouse blues and long, improvised rock guitar solos. But the
motorcycle death a year earlier of Duane Allman—the band's co-founder and co-
lead guitarist—was a blow that left the band's future uncertain.

In need of material for their next album, "Brothers and Sisters," guitarist
Dickey Betts offered up "Ramblin' Man," a song he had written and hoped to
sell in Nashville. The band liked the upbeat country song about wanderlust,
but all agreed it would need an arrangement more in keeping with their blues-
rock sound.

![](http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-
BL789_0214RA_DV_20140211120730.jpg) ENLARGE

When "Ramblin' Man" was released as a single in Sept. 1973, the song became
the band's biggest all-time hit—climbing to No. 2 on Billboard's pop chart and
helping "Brothers and Sisters" remain at No. 1 on the album chart for five
straight weeks. Mr. Betts left the band after a dispute in 2000. Shortly after
news in January that the Allman Brothers would cease touring after 2014, Mr.
Betts, 70, guitarist Les Dudek, 61, and pianist Chuck Leavell, 61—the latter
two also former band members—spoke about "Ramblin' Man" and the influence Hank
Williams, Benny Goodman and Eric Clapton's "Layla" had on the song. Edited
from interviews.

**Dickey Betts:** In 1969, I was playing guitar in several rock bands that toured central Florida. Whenever I'd have trouble finding a place to stay, my friend Kenny Harwick would let me crash at his garage apartment for a few days in Sarasota. Kenny was a friendly, hayseed-cowboy kind of guy who built fences and liked to answer his own questions before you had a chance. One day he asked me how I was doing with my music and said, "I bet you're just tryin' to make a livin' and doin' the best you can."

I liked how that sounded and carried the line around in my head for about
three years. Then one day in 1972, I was sitting in the kitchen of what we
called the Big House in Macon, Ga.—where everyone in the band lived—and
decided to finish the lyrics. The words came fast, like I was writing a
letter. When [producer] Johnny Sandlin asked later if I had any songs for our
upcoming album, I ran down "Ramblin' Man" on my acoustic guitar. Everyone in
the room went nuts.

My inspiration was Hank Williams's "Ramblin' Man," from 1951. His song and
mine are completely different but I liked his mournful, minor-chord feel.

Except for Kenny's line, the rest of the lyrics were autobiographical. When I
was a kid, my dad was in construction and used to move the family back and
forth between central Florida's east and west coasts. I'd go to one school for
a year and then the other the next. I had two sets of friends and spent a lot
of time in the back of a Greyhound bus. Ramblin' was in my blood.

But the song, as I originally wrote it, had a country flavor and needed to be
Allmanized—given that rock-blues feeling. I thought of Eric Clapton's
"Layla"—which had come out a year earlier—with its long jam at the end. I
figured something like that might work. When we went into Capricorn Sound
Studios in Macon in October '72, "Ramblin' Man" was the first song we
recorded—and it would be [bassist] Berry Oakley's last song before he died in
a motorcycle crash a month later.

I knew "Ramblin' Man" needed a solid intro to grab the listener. My daddy had
been a fiddler and I heard a lot of fiddle music as a child. I had a ukulele
and had played along with him. What I came up with for the intro was a fiddle-
like opener built on a pentatonic scale—but with me on guitar and Chuck
[Leavell] on piano exchanging lines.

**Chuck Leavell:** Dickey had a cool country-rock lick for the intro and he and I created a call-and-response on guitar and piano to round it out. I came up with my line answering Dickey's, and then we worked on the harmonies on the lines we played together.

AF097_RAMBLI_P_20140213104744.jpg) ENLARGE

**Mr. Betts:** After we had the intro down, I played rhythm and sang the song's verse and chorus, and Chuck played bluesy piano fills. On the break between the song's verses and chorus, I took a solo. Then I had an idea that threw everyone for a loop. For that "Layla"-like instrumental part, I asked everyone to play the same line over and over again as I sang, "Lord, I was born a ramblin' man." This set up the next part. I wanted to overdub guitars in harmony—two playing high notes and two playing low notes. Then I planned to overdub a solo over all those guitars stacked together.

**Mr. Leavell:** I played rhythm piano on the studio's 9-foot Steinway grand, listening to drummers Butch [Trucks] and Jaimoe [Johanson] so I'd be in sync with what they were doing. I was also trying to complement Dickey's vocals, answering him with a line or two on piano and singing the lower harmony parts on the chorus. 

**Les Dudek:** I was up in Macon that fall when Dickey invited me to the studio. When I entered the control room, the band was rehearsing "Ramblin' Man." They'd record parts and listen back to hear how the song was developing. Dickey kept asking what I thought of his overdubs and I'd tell him. Finally he said, "Hell, why don't you come out in the studio and play it with me." So I did. I played the high harmony parts and Dickey played the low ones. After we recorded the first set in the lower register, we overdubbed the same harmonies in the higher register. Then they stacked them all together on the tape. You hear us where the riff starts to repeat and there's a wall of guitars playing harmonies in two octaves. Quite cool, actually. 

A transition was needed entering the instrumental section, so I suggested a
drum fill to introduce the higher octave guitar parts. The section itself had
four guitar parts playing harmonies in two octaves. Toward the end, Dickey
overdubbed a slide guitar solo by placing his guitar flat and playing it like
a lap steel.

**Mr. Betts:** All of it together had a big, symphonic sound. It was like Benny Goodman's stuff in the '30s. His band was arranged so it would have this big, broad sound, with Benny's high clarinet weaving in and out. The contrast was exciting. Once we had all the guitar parts recorded, I did the same. I put on a headset and added my solo weaving in and out.

**Mr. Dudek:** The control room was packed the night we listened to the final playback. Phil Walden and all the executives from Capricorn were there along with the band's road crew. It was Duane's band, and everyone was just trying to survive his death. The band's signature sound was the double guitar harmony thing, with Duane and Dickey—and Dickey and I had just carried on the tradition, with the guitar harmonies—a salute to Duane. When the playback stopped, you could hear a pin drop. Then Red Dog [roadie Joe Campbell] said, "Damn. That's the best I've heard since Duane."

It's an interesting story, but I wonder if Dickey isn't forgetting something.

  

Blind Blake, a renowned blues musician, recorded "Police Dog Blues" in 1929.
"Police Dog Blues" opens with the lines:

  

 All my life I've been a travelin' man  
   All my life I've been a travelin' man  
   Stayin' alone and doin' the best I can  

  

Which certainly prefigures Dickey's:

   Lord, I was born a ramblin' man,

   Tryin' to make a livin' and doin' the best I can.

  

The lyrical similarity doesn't end there.  Where Dickey sings:

   Leaving out of Nashville, Tennessee,  
   They're always having a good time down on the bayou, Lord  
   Them Delta women think the world of me.  

  

Blind Blake sang:

   I shipped my trunk down to Tennessee  
   I shipped my trunk down to Tennessee  
   Hard to tell about a man like me  

  

Blake's song also includes lines about a woman's dog (named.... Rambler):

   His name is Rambler, when he gets a chance

   He leaves his mark on everybody's pants

  

Now maybe this is all just coincidence, but I suspect not.

Ramblin' Man, Jessica, In Memory of Elizabeth Reed and Blue Sky, all the best
of the Allman Brother's Band. I especially liked he piano solo on Jessica by
Chuck Leavell.  
  
These songs are staples on my iPod, and they bring back fond memories of an
ill spent youth.  
  
Today's youth have pablum music to listen to. The blues and jazz, both
indigineous forms of American music, have fallen out of favor in the mass
audience and at least two generations have lost out on what really is "cool"
music.

I saw "them" a few years ago. No Allmans. I now refer to them as "The Allman
Brothers Brand". I'm guessing soon there will be franchises touring.  
  
But an interesting musical article, for sure. Thanks for that. It always
fascinates me how "pop" music is created. I still listen to Bowie... always
intrigued with how he comes up with so many unique sounds, from album to
album, song to song, and (especially) within songs. He says he always writes
the music first. I find that amazing, because so many songs seem to take on
the musical personality of the lyrics. Really interesting stuff. Can't tap
your foot to a widget.

Thanks for this moment ... a tune brings us back to another time ... returning
to dorm rooms on the campus of Boston College ... across the hall ... Ramblin
Man come from the massive speakers ... the Allman's are not dead ... the
legend of Duane lives on.  
Saw the Allman Brothers (with Dickey) play this at their induction into the
Rock N Roll Hall of Fame ... perhaps 20 years its release .... great then,
great now. .. A classic.

I like the song. I like Blue Sky the best. I liked being 20 something then. I
don't like most of the techo garbage rap and stuff we have to endure from
cheap no-talent celebrities all over the place. And I don't like being 60
something now.

What was most wonderful to hear is how much thought and effort went into all
the different parts of this song. It reminds you how "REAL" musicians work....
I'm sure Snoop Dog has the same level of discipline and in 40 years the WSJ
will have an article such as this on how long it took Snoop to find words that
rhymed with witch and wore! /s

The history of a song is so unique for many. A blend of capturing lyrics and
snappy music with instruments so well chosen and played that it achieves a
life long existence.

Mr. Myers; a sincere "Thank You" for this. Amazingly, just yesterday I was
trying to remember the 3rd line of the 2nd verse, and clearly recall singing
this one out loud walking home from school as an 8th grader. For some reason,
the lyrics, melody, and arrangement just had the ability to make a 14-yr. old
kid dream big. I received "Brothers and Sisters" from my parents for Christmas
that year, and although "Southbound" and "Jessica' were a close 2nd, I wanted
it for "Ramblin" Man"

Jason, elaborate. No Gregg in the band? No Jaimoe? No Butch?

Ditto. I first saw the Brothers when they were the Allman Joys (I kid you
not).  
  
Hard to pick a favorite, though. My guess is most would say Liz Reed.  
  
Me? I'd have to go with Statesboro Blues. For hard rocking blues, it doesn't
git much better than that.

were armed men on motorcycles who support Mr. Maduro's government. The

SOCHI, Russia—U.S. speedskaters missed the podium again on Thursday in the
women's 1,000 meters. Heather Richardson and Brittany Bowe had both been
considered extremely likely to earn medals and even contend for gold. But at
the Adler Arena, neither one could approach the time set early on by China's
gold medalist,  Zhang Hong. She won in 1 minute 14.02 seconds and both
Americans were over a second slower.

Ireen Wust of the Netherlands, already a gold-medal winner in the women's
3,000 meters, took the silver. And her countrywoman Margot Boer was third.
That means that the Netherlands have now won a total of 12 of 18 possible
medals in men's and women's speedskating at these Winter Games.

Zhang's success marked China's second gold medal of the Olympics in a matter
of hours. Earlier in the day, Li Jianrou earned short-track gold in the 500
meters.

Sadly, a recurring theme: If it involves a stop watch or a tape measure, the
US isn't very competitive these days. A probable answer is the current
emphasis of participation over excellence in all school sports programs.
Fortunately, with our current population base of 315 million, the US can still
come up with a few competitors so match up against countries like Slovenia (2
million) or Sweden (9.5 million).

That has little to do with it. We are losing to competitors from countries
with cold weather all year long, in events they consider their national
sports. America cannot be expected to dominate as they would in our own
national sports.

I respectfully disagree. There are abundant alpine ski areas in the US.
Speedskating takes place at dedicated indoor facilities and the dry-land
training is very accessible to everyone these days. A similar analysis applies
to cross-country skiing, where there is 9 month snow accessibility and
excellent dry-land training. I would hold on to my argument in the summer
Olympics sports involving stop watches and tape measures. Based on our
population and resources, US athletes don't measure up very well. It is great
when we have exceptions: Galen Rupp and Leo Manzano come to mind, but the
overall trend is downward.

Gold prices rose to their highest level in three months Thursday, as weaker-
than-expected U.S. economic data bolstered the case for a slower rollback of
the Federal Reserve's bond-buying program.

Retail sales fell in January, marking the second straight monthly decline.
Meanwhile, the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits
rose last week, the latest sign of rockiness in the labor market.

Taken together,...

Updated Feb. 13, 2014 11:00 a.m. ET 

SOCHI, Russia—The men's U.S. hockey team, irked at being considered gold-medal
underdogs in this Olympic tournament, made a statement Thursday in its first
game in Sochi, steamrolling Slovakia 7-1.

Team USA got off to a slow start in the first period and failed to take
advantage of an early power play against a Slovakian team not expected to be
too formidable, despite a lineup of mostly NHL players.  

USA defenseman John Carlson scored the only goal of the first period. The
Slovakians tied the game 1-1 with a goal by the Detroit Red Wings' Tomas Tatar
in the opening minute of the second period. Had the Russian team been watching
(they were playing, too, against Slovenia), they would have taken comfort in
their rivals' sluggish performance to that point.  

But that Slovakian goal jump-started the U.S. team, which then scored two
goals in quick succession and then began pouring it on in a monster second
period that ended with Team USA leading 7-1.

"It slapped us in the face and we said, 'We've got to get going or else this
is going to be a highflying game,'" said St. Louis Blues forward David Backes.

Things quieted down in the third as the U.S. held on to its healthy lead. By
game's end, six different Americans had scored, with the Colorado Avalanche's
Paul Stastny netting two.

Up next for the U.S. is its much-anticipated game against Russia. The winner
of that game will likely win the group, barring an unexpected loss from either
in the third game of round-robin play.

Team Canada is the favorite of the games, and Sweden is a hockey powerhouse.
But Russia, which beat Slovenia 5-2 on Thursday, is riding the excitement of
playing on its home turf. Judging from the large, loud contingent of Russian
fans even at games that don't involve their country, Saturday's sellout crowd
will be a force.

Olympic Games are being played on a bigger rink than the NHL arenas of the
U.S. and Canada. Those North American teams haven't medaled while playing on
international-sized ice since NHL players were first allowed to play in the
Olympics in 1998.

Team USA was still adjusting to the ice on Thursday. A few times, Slovakian
players used the extra space to slip by the U.S., once nearly producing a
breakaway goal.

"There are so many more passing lanes out there, you have to manage the puck
really well because you don't want to have to give it up," said the Toronto
Maple Leafs' James van Riemsdyk.

If there was ever a country that you would expect to do well at the Winter
Olympics, it's the one with "ice" in its name. But in 16 previous trips to the
Games, Iceland has never won so much as a medal.

The Summer Olympics are more Iceland's thing. There, at least, the country has
won four medals, including a silver in team handball at the 2008 Beijing
Games.

The main reason Iceland fails to live up to its name is that it doesn't get
enough snow. The country far prefers sports that can be played in vast indoor
halls, like soccer and handball.

"For the winter sports, we are depending so much on the weather," said Andri
Stefansson, the head of Iceland's Olympic committee.

But the biggest impediment is probably Iceland's small population. With only
320,000 inhabitants, the pool of potential Olympians is shallow. Most of the
top athletes are drawn to more popular sports that can be played year-round.

Once Saevar Birgisson, one of Iceland's five athletes in Sochi, got serious
about cross-country skiing, he had to move to southern Sweden to train.

But in cases like Birgisson's, qualifying someone for the Olympics is the
reward. Birgisson is the first cross-country skier to qualify from Iceland in
two decades. This has turned him into a major celebrity in his country. The
president came to visit him in the athlete's village the other day. Birgisson
was training and kept him waiting for 30 minutes.

"I felt bad, but I had to train," he said.

###### Meet the World's Most Machete-Proof Athletes

![Two speedskaters crash during a 1,500-meter
race.](http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OL-
AA993_YS1_P_20140212181652.jpg) ENLARGE

When short-track speedskating resumes on Thursday, there's one thing to keep
in mind: Accidents are pretty much inevitable when five or so people skate
around curves in a cluster at over 30 miles an hour. The problem is that
they're using skates that come with blades barely a millimeter thick and more
than a foot long. In other words, the athletes are all wearing a pair of giant
knives in disguise. But by now the pros have plenty of tips on how to avoid
getting sliced up:

**1)** It's all about the suit. Since the last Olympics, cut-resistant suits made of ballistic nylon or Kevlar have become standard issue. They cover skaters from their necks to their extremities, which are protected by cut-proof gloves and boots. They also wear headgear similar to bicycle helmets. "So from head-to-toe, I'm cut-proof," Dutch skater Freek van der Wart said. "But my face isn't cut-proof."

**2)** Short-track can be pretty intimate. In the middle of the pack, skaters are constantly patting each other on the shoulder, the back and the rear end. But they aren't just being friendly. It's about letting your competition know where you are. Because deliberate obstruction moves are mostly illegal, giving the guy in front of you a warning is a good way to create some space and, more important, prevent him from cleaning you out.

**3)** If you have to fall, there's a right way to do it. Make sure your feet are up and you lead with your shoulder when you skid off into the padded wall. The last thing you want is an ankle turn and your own blade coming back at you. Worse still is crashing with someone else. "If you're going into the wall with someone, you don't know where your blades are," British skater Jon Eley said. He would know: in 2012, he had a blade go right through his boot in a crash and sever a tendon. "You can't predict what's going to happen."

###### Get Me One 'Manhatten' Dog, And Hold the Mayo—Please!

Please, please don't confuse me for a foodie—my current idea of fine dining is
eating my baby son's leftover sweet potato dinosaurs. But even this unrefined
palate draws the line at Sochi's Brooklyn and "Manhatten" hot dogs. Both
variety of hot dogs are available for 200 rubles, or about $5.75, at Rosa
Khutor Extreme Park. Both do culinary injustices to their New York namesakes.
The "Manhatten" hot dog is a mixture of fried onions and pickles, a
combination which has a crisp potential. But the experience is undone by the
hot dog itself, which is bland and neutral and tastes exactly like nothing.
The mayo—mayo!—didn't help. It is blah, which neither Manhatten nor Manhattan
ever is, except TriBeCa after 9 p.m.

Journal

And the Brooklyn dog? Don't get me started. My borough is the home to Nathan's
Famous, territorial about the hot dog game, home to the alarming Fourth of
July contest at the boardwalk in which strange people stuff themselves with
dog after dog after dog after dog. But this Sochi Brooklyn dog, flecked with
bacon and smothered in a cheese bath, was a challenging experience. The cheese
was ample and mysterious. My first bite was my last. It did not feel like
home.

Still, I don't want to be an ugly New Yorker, a crank, a hot dog pessimist. I
remain hopeful in Sochi, on the hunt for Bronx, Queens and Staten Island dogs.

###### The Sochi Know-It-All, Part 2: How to Be a Fake Luge Expert

Confess: As a typical U.S. sports fan, you know the luge involves a very fast
slide down a mountain track in a vehicle that is not a bobsled. Period. So
just in time for a new event borrowing a page from track and swimming relays,
we asked former U.S. Olympic luger Tony Benshoof for advice on how look smart
in front of fellow ignoramuses.

Luge requires athletes to paddle with spiked gloves at the start and lay flat
down an icy, one-mile track. The flatter they are, the better, as they steer
with shoulder and leg pressure. That poses a big challenge: lugers must steer
at speeds reaching 97 miles an hour without seeing where they're going.

Thursday's new team event will combine a men's race, a women's race and a
doubles run, in which two athletes lay flat, one on top of the other. Instead
of a finish light at the end of each leg, the athlete punches a rubber pad and
a gate opens back at the top and the next athlete starts. It's the first time
the team event has been an Olympic competition.

Watch for long, aggressive paddles at the start of a run. Even a 1000th of a
second advantage can translate into a medal. Obviously, brushing the walls
once the run starts is bad. Another mistake: if a luger "loops a curve," or
heads into a curve too high. The sled ends up coming out of the curve too high
once it reaches the next straightaway. "You're creating a longer distance to
the finish line," Benshoof says.

The doubles competition is even more challenging, because the person on the
bottom is the driver. The duo works together using body language. When the top
athlete rolls his head to the left for instant, it can be a signal that it's
time to steer.

###### Bike Bonanza: How Sochi Most Resembles Portland

######

The streets around the Olympic Park in Sochi may be filled with cars and
buses, but athletes prefer biking to work. Brian Costa talks to Jordan Malone,
an American short-track speed-skater, about why this is becoming the bike
Olympics.

Spotting an Olympian in Sochi doesn't require a ticket to an event. All it
takes is walking through the Olympic Park and watching for the bikes. In a
scene more reminiscent of coastal Oregon, many Olympic athletes have been
eschewing cars and buses by biking to and from their competition venues.

"If you look out in front of the [athletes'] cafeteria, it's stacked full of
bikes," said U.S. short-track speed skater Jordan Malone. "At any given time,
there are probably 50 or 60 bikes out in front of there."

Malone, who won a bronze medal in the 5,000-meter relay in 2010 and will
compete in the same event Thursday, said the bike craze is unique to Sochi. At
the Vancouver Games, biking around a larger urban area held less appeal.

BMW supplied 25 bikes to Team USA at the start of the Games, but the demand
for them inside the athletes' village quickly exceeded supply. The U.S.
Olympic Committee has since restricted athletes' use to two hours at a time
and only within the athletes' village. As a result, some athletes have bought
their own bikes to ride around Sochi.

With donations from friends and supporters, Malone, 29, spent $150 on a bike
that he now uses to get to and from practices and competitions. (He guessed it
might have cost $50 at a U.S. Wal-Mart.) When the Games end, Malone said he
and other athletes plan to donate the bikes to a nearby school.

Volkswagen workers in Chattanooga are voting this week on whether to become

The irony is that auto makers moved into southern right-to-work states in

Gerhard Heiberg, Norway's longtime International Olympic Committee member,
stirred the pot with his oil-rich countrymen by telling the NRK national
broadcasting service that the nation is known for being "arrogant." The
comments were a dominant fixture in Tuesday's news coverage back home, with
outlets ranging from Oslo-based VG (with 2.3 million readers) to the cozy
"News in English" website giving the comments considerable ink.

[ ![](http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OG-
AA793_SOCHI__D_20140204163228.png) ENLARGE  ](http://olympics.wsj.com/)

Heiberg, 74, can be a bit of a critic of his homeland and his comments have at
times in the past irritated Norwegians. Earlier this week, he inserted himself
in the controversy over Norwegian ski champ Marit Bjørgen's medals after it
became known that a Norwegian company called Ludo has used her in a
commercial. He has, however, been a major advocate of brining the Winter Games
to Oslo – a proposal that many Norwegians have said is too expensive.

A cross-country skier and tennis player who was once the chief executive of
large Norwegian industrial group, he headed the Lillehammer Olympic Organizing
Committee for the 1994 Games in Norway and has remained involved in the
Olympics ever since.

Controversy over his "arrogant" comments stem from an interview he did in
relation to the Norwegian cross country team's decision to wear black armbands
on Saturday during a 15 km race after one of their mates lost her brother. He
was also upset about Martin Johnsrud Sundby receiving a warning after a
controversial change of track just before the finish of a race in which he
took bronze.

Heiberg pointed out this broke IOC rules against protest or personal
statements by Olympians, and noted this was the second warning against the
Norwegians in Sochi after just a few days of events.

According to the NRK, Heiberg was suggesting Norway needs to "clean up" in
order to avoid more trouble. "Let's hope that things calm down," he said.

Norway has long been a dominant force in the Winter Games, and was predicted
by many – including The Wall Street Journal – to win the overall medal count
in Sochi due to its dominance on cross-country skis. Through Tuesday, Norway
has medaled seven times, including hauling in a pair of golds. But the
majority of the medals have been awarded for third place.

Heiberg isn't the only one complaining. The Russians have taken serious issue
with Sundby's change of track, suggesting he got off easy with only a warning
because he is Norwegian.

Bjørn Dæhlie, a former Norwegian ski champ who won multiple medals, told the
NRK Heiberg shouldn't be taken seriously. "I think the vast majority had great
understanding for why they did that," he said, referring to the armbands. He
also said most IOC members probably understand "deep down" why the women wore
them.

The General Secretary of the Norwegian Olympic and Paralympic Committee and
Confederation of Sports, Inge Andersen, met late Monday with the IOC, which
said it would consider changing the rules on mourning patches. "The IOC was
very humble," Andersen told Aftenposten, a Norwegian newspaper.

And Heiberg himself hasn't been absent of empathy with the mourning skiers. He
told Norway's TV 2 that "I think we'll find a solution to this, where rules
will be changed. Where we're showing a little more human compassion."

WASHINGTON—The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits

Department said Thursday. That was...

a 0.4%...

SOCHI, Russia—Russia banned adoptions by single people from countries where
same-sex marriage is legal, regardless of the prospective parent's sexual
orientation. The new measure comes into law in the middle of a Winter Olympics
already steeped in controversy over the country's attitude toward gays.

The decree, signed by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and posted on the
government's website Thursday, also reiterates a ban on...

A host of the world's largest gold miners slashed the size of their reserves
and announced further asset write-downs, highlighting the extent of the damage
that last year's 28% drop in the price of gold has inflicted on the sector.

But the revaluations came as gold hit its highest level in three months, as
weaker-than-expected U.S. economic data bolstered the case for a slower
rollback of the Federal Reserve's bond-buying program....

Good morning,

Turning of the Tide

After striking an interim nuclear deal that eased sanctions on Iran in
exchange for curbing its nuclear program, the Obama administration has played
down the economic impact of the move. But as talks between Iran and global
powers are set to resume in Vienna on Tuesday, we report that the Iranian
economy, though still crippled, has already begun to show signs of
improvement. The International Monetary Fund said it expects to see growth
there of up to 2% for fiscal 2015, after contracting...

In accepting a $45 billion merger proposal from Comcast Corp., Time Warner
Cable Inc. is ridding itself of an unwanted suitor, but it made some financial
trade-offs in the process.

The agreement marks an abrupt twist to an eight-month takeover battle for Time
Warner Cable waged by Charter Communications Inc. and its biggest shareholder,

Charter is unlikely to...

U.S. President Barack Obama's arrival in the Philippines this April should
lend fresh impetus to faltering talks over the deployment of U.S. military
forces to Subic Bay, a strategic location overlooking the disputed South China
Sea.

The bilateral discussions began last August, but are understood to have
stalled over the status of new "temporary" facilities, which would house
visiting U.S. forces without contravening a...

PepsiCo Inc. is throwing a bone to investors after deciding it will keep
trying to turn around slumping soft-drink sales instead of taking more drastic

including activist investor Nelson Peltz have been pressing management to
jettison the struggling...

OBAMACARE STILL NOT WORKING Liberals and their media allies are celebrating
the fact that more than one million people signed up for the Affordable Care
Act's new insurance plans in January, bringing the total so far to 3.3
million. But the new customers aren't young enough to make the economics of
ObamaCare work, and of course signing up doesn't mean that someone is a paying
customer. Or as former CBO Director Douglas Holtz-Eakin puts it in a recent
posting on Twitter: "Enrollment at 3.3 million. Those actually paying a
premium probably closer to 3.3." Writing in our pages today, Karl Rove argues
that...
