There could be worse places to fete Architectural Digest than in Ralph Lauren's Madison Avenue flagship. Guests in bow ties and tasteful pearls swanned up and down grand vanilla staircases all night.

The magazine's new editor in chief  Margaret Russell (formerly of Elle Decor) held court in a few spots because she was forced to wear an ankle brace following a recent accident. She said there are apps, a new website and, though Ms. Russell wouldn't comment, a reported peek into  Elizabeth Taylor's home in the works. 

Ms. Russell was asked if one could bribe his or her way into the magazine. "Of course, you can't," she said. "If a project deserves to be in the magazine, it deserves to be in the magazine." 

Meanwhile, over at the Marriott Marquis, the Ad Council and the United Negro College Fund held a glittery gala featuring a performance by  Roberta Flack. "I'm here because of my association as a Howard [University] graduate," Ms. Flack said. "Being a singer, they asked me to sing. So I'm going to do just that." 

Ms. Flack, who is working on a Beatles covers album, is inextricably linked to "Killing Me Softly," the ballad that won her three Grammy awards. The song has never disappeared from the public consciousness since she sang it in 1973. 

How does the singer feel when she hears others sing her song? "I feel good. It makes you think of me," she said. "How do I feel about 'the song' being sung by other people? I feel great. Because I did it first. If the song wasn't beautiful and important, it wouldn't last."
