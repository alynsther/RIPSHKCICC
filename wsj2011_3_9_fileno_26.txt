NEW DELHIâ€”Reliance Industries Ltd. may increase production of natural gas from April at the D6 block in the Krishna-Godavari basin, off India's east coast, the country's upstream regulator said Wednesday. The news lifted shares of India's largest private explorer by sales. 

"As per their [Reliance Industries'] plan submitted to us, the gas output from KG-D6 may rise to 67 million metric standard cubic meters a day in April," S.K. Srivastava, director general at the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons, told reporters. 

Mr. Srivastava said Reliance Industries is currently producing 53 MMSCMD of gas from the deep-water D6 block in the Krishna-Godavari basin, India's richest gas find so far. 

An increase in gas production at D6 will be good news for investors of Reliance Industries as the block is a significant contributor to its revenue and India's gas production. The company has so far lagged in its production target for D6. 

Reliance Industries, controlled by Mukesh Ambani, produced 60 MMSCMD of gas at D6 during April-June 2010. Production fell to 58 MMSCMD during July-September, but the company didn't give any reason for the decline. It also didn't disclose the output figure for the October-December quarter, but analysts pegged it at 54 MMSCMD-55 MMSCMD. 

Reliance Industries was initially scheduled to increase D6 gas production to a peak of 80 MMSCMD by March 2010. It later stretched the deadline to December 2010, but missed that target as well. 

The company is expected to achieve peak production of 80 MMSCMD in 2012-13. 

"As per their plans submitted to us, their output from D1 and D3 [gas fields] would be 59 MMSCMD and eight from MA [Mukesh Ambani field], which means 67 MMSCMD from D6 in April," Mr. Srivastava said. 

"Two new wells are already drilled and are to be connected and two more are to be drilled. We hope that it will be completed by April," he added. 

In February, Reliance Industries agreed to sell a 30% stake in 23 of its oil and gas blocks to BP PLC for $7.2 billion, plus another $1.8 billion linked to future exploration success. The D6 block is also part of the deal. 

The KG-D6 block was given to a consortium of Reliance Industries and Canada's Niko Resources Ltd. in April 2000, in the first round of auctions under India's New Exploration Licensing Policy. Reliance now has a 90% participating interest in the block and Niko has the remainder. 

Shares of Reliance gained as much as 1.97% to 1,003.8 rupees ($22), their highest level in about two weeks. They traded 1.25% higher at 997.4 rupees in afternoon trading on the Bombay Stock Exchange, outperforming a 0.23% rise in the main index.
