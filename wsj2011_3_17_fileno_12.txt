WASHINGTON—It may take weeks to cool and solve the problems plaguing several nuclear reactors in Japan, the chairman of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission said Thursday. 

NRC chief Greg Jaczko said at a briefing at the White House that the Japanese are dealing with a "very difficult" crisis in trying to prevent a disaster at several nuclear reactors damaged by an earthquake and resulting tsunami. He said at times the information regarding the nuclear reactors can be complex and confusing. 

He said the U.S. has 11 technical experts on the ground, collecting information and analyzing the situation. The U.S. is working closely with the Japanese government and the private sector, he added. 

The Obama administration has provided expertise, equipment and assistance to the Japanese in the wake of the earthquake. President Barack Obama paid an unannounced visit to the Japanese Embassy in Washington Thursday. Mr. Obama, who is scheduled to make a statement on Japan at the White House Thursday afternoon, arrived at the embassy to sign a condolence book.

Mr. Jaczko said it was "prudent" for U.S. citizens in Japan to evacuate beyond a 50-mile radius of the reactors. That recommendation, made Wednesday, stands in contrast to the 12-mile radius recommended by the Japanese. 

The recommendation for a 50-mile radius was based on new information, particularly about the lack of cooling water around spent nuclear-fuel tanks, Mr. Jaczko said. The administration said the differing recommendations doesn't mean the U.S. mistrusts information coming from the Japanese. 

"The Japanese government has tremendous long-standing capabilities in this area," said Daniel B. Poneman, U.S. deputy secretary of energy. 

When the administration was asked what might happen next, Mr. Jaczko said he didn't want to speculate.
