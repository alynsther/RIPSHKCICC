Information technology analyst Manik Taneja's best call in 2010 was a buy on outsourcing firm eClerx Services Ltd., which he maintained for the whole year. The stock was good for a 162% return.

"The company continues to deliver well," says Mr. Taneja, 28, "as the company has got recognized for its consistent financial performance, strong return ratios, good cash-generation profile and high dividend-payout policy."

Mr. Taneja, an analyst at Emkay Global Financial Services, also benefited from spotting a few underperformers in the Indian technology market. He put sell calls on Satyam Computer Services Ltd. in October and on Tech Mahindra Ltd. from late January through the end of April, saving investors heeding his advice 21% and 32%, respectively. He did miss on another underperformer, though, with a a buy call on education-services provider NIIT Ltd. It lost 18% in 2010.

"We expected NIIT to gain from the uptick in hiring from the Indian IT industry and expected improvement in financial performance ahead," Mr. Taneja said. "However, the company has disappointed."



Mr. Taneja's outlook for the Indian technology market in 2011 is somber, as higher interest rates and rising prices challenge the country's economy.

"Inflation will continue to inch up," he said. "We do not see markets turning the opposite way unless at least the outlook on inflation and interest rates reverses."
