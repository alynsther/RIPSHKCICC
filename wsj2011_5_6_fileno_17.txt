  Chen Show Mao, a partner in the Beijing office of the law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell, was billed as the Workers' Party's "star catch" upon his return to Singapore to contest this year's elections. Observers say the 50-year-old's degrees from Harvard, Oxford and Stanford universities and a work portfolio that includes the world's largest initial public offerings make him a valuable symbol of the opposition's strength and credibility.



 Wall Street Journal: Do you think Singapore is changing and or "liberalizing" in any meaningful way, and how might this coming election signify that?  Chen: During the campaign, we found people more willing than in the past to show their support for us in public. I guess we will have to wait till after polling day to find out if indeed any meaningful changes are under way.



 WSJ: In a rally speech, you spoke of helping the less fortunate. Is this call for inclusiveness a cornerstone of the Workers' Party's approach to governance?  Chen: We believe not only in economic growth, but also that the growth should benefit most Singaporeans.



 WSJ: How do you hope a strengthened opposition can change the current governance of Singapore?  Chen: I hope a stronger opposition presence in Parliament will help bring about more robust discussions and debate on government policies, and greater transparency, resulting in more responsive policymaking. I hope that more Singaporeans, both young and older, will come forward to help build a stronger opposition.
