B.J. Raji's touchdown in Green Bay's win on Sunday not only knocked Chicago out of the playoffs, it also knocked a beloved Bear out of the record books. According to Stats Inc., Mr. Raji is the heaviest player to ever score a postseason touchdown, based on his listed weight of 337 pounds. The previous record-holder?

Sunday night's Jets-Steelers game on CBS was the most-watched AFC Championship Game of all time, according to Nielsen data provided by the network. About 54.8 million people were watching, on average, as Pittsburgh held on for a 24-19 win, the network said. That ranks it behind only three NFC title games: 49ers-Cowboys in 1982, Saints-Vikings last year and 49ers-Cowboys in 1995. Over the final hour of Sunday's game, as the Jets attempted a comeback, more than 56 million people were watching.
