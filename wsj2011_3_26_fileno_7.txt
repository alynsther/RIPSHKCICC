There's only one good way to get a major-league hitter to bark an expletive, slam his bat and lazily jog to first base: Get him to hit an infield pop-up. And the two active pitchers who are most skilled at doing this happen to play in New York. 

It's no real surprise that the best active pitcher at inducing pop-ups is Mariano Rivera—after all, he is the best at many things. Since 2002, he has caused batters to pop up a startling 15.8% of all batted balls put into play. But new Mets righty Chris Young barely trails him at 15.3% and is the leader in this stat among active starters with at least 400 innings. Because they generate so many easy outs, Rivera and Young have extremely low batting averages against. At .208 for his career, Rivera is fourth best among active pitchers. Chris Young's .217 average allowed is tops among all major league starters with at least 400 innings.

Looking at both pitchers' career rates, it's clear that forcing pop-ups is more skill than luck. Young has been well above the major league average rate of about 9% in every season, with a low of 12.1% in 2005. Same for Rivera, whose career low is 11.1% in 2003. His career high was 26.2% the following year. 

A look farther down the list of pitchers who specialize in inducing pop-ups reveals that the new Mets front office may be tracking this infield flyball statistic. Three of their off-season pitching acquisitions are in the top 20. Jason Isringhausen is 15th (13.1%) and Chris Capuano 18th (12.9%).

Rivera and Young will face the ultimate test of their pop-up abilities this year. The Mets and Yankees each face the Reds and Joey Votto, who amazingly did not pop up once last season on his way to becoming the National League's Most Valuable Player.
