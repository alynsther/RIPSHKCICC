Every time Yankees general manager Brian Cashman has spoken with pitcher Andy Pettitte lately, it has only served to strengthen what he already thought—Mr. Pettitte is likely to retire, and the Yankees shouldn't count on him in 2011, Mr. Cashman said Wednesday. 

If the veteran does return, it will be with the Yankees, not his home-state Texas Rangers as some have speculated. Mr. Cashman said the Yankees will continue to scour the thin trade market for replacements, but could go into the season with in-house options Ivan Nova and Sergio Mitre rounding out the rotation. 

Mr. Pettitte, 38, went 11-3 with a 3.28 earned run average for the Yankees last year.

The Jets on Wednesday placed right tackle Damien Woody on season-ending injured reserve after he sustained an injury to his left Achilles' tendon in Saturday's win over the Indianapolis Colts. Coach Rex Ryan said Mr. Woody was scheduled to undergo surgery on Wednesday. 

His loss is a blow to the Jets heading into Sunday's divisional playoff game against the New England Patriots, though they were able to cope without him when he missed the last three games of the regular season with a right knee injury. Wayne Hunter will start in his absence.

"We're fortunate," Mr. Ryan said. "I've always said I feel like we have the best backup tackle in the league in Wayne Hunter.''
