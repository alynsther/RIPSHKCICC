After a winter of getting spurned by free agents who wouldn't take their money, the Angels finally found a way to use their bundles of cash and acquired outfielder Vernon Wells from Toronto. In picking up Mr. Wells, whose contract calls for a $23 million salary in 2011, the Angels have guaranteed themselves baseball's most expensive outfield—one that actually costs more than the entire payroll of several teams.

Along with Mr. Wells, the Angels will pay $18 million to Torii Hunter and $9 million to Bobby Abreu, giving them the game's most expensive trio of outfielders. The cash flow doesn't stop there, as they're still on the hook for the remaining $11 million on Gary Matthews Jr.'s contract—a player they jettisoned early last year. Once you include those payments, the outfielders on the Angels payroll cost 43% more than the next priciest group. 

As you might expect, the Angels aren't getting much bang for the buck, either. Last year their highly compensated foursome (even including the departed Mr. Matthews) combined for 9.7 Wins Above Replacement—a metric that measures a player's total value over a Triple-A call-up. That's roughly the same amount that the Red Sox quartet produced, but Boston is paying nearly $22 million less to Carl Crawford, J.D. Drew, Mike Cameron, and Jacoby Ellsbury. Even the much-maligned Chicago Cubs outfield of Alfonso Soriano, Kosuke Fukudome, and Marlon Byrd produced more value for significantly less money.
