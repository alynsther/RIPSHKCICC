BANGALORE -- Talwalkars Better Value Fitness Ltd. will consider raising funds through a share sale at its board meeting on May 12.

The company also says it plans to start a new business, it said in a filing to the stock exchanges. 

A local analyst said the news is positive as the funds could help the company finance its plans to tap the growth opportunities offered by India's wellness-services industry at a time when the penetration of health and fitness clubs in India is still low. He added, the company's plans to raise funds through the equity route would be welcome as it wouldn't add to its debt burden in a scenario where borrowing costs are on the rise. 

Talwalkars will consider raising money through institutional placement of equity.
