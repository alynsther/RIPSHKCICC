A rain of dead and injured red-winged blackbirds that fell over an Arkansas town on New Year's Eve was likely caused by a booming noise, potentially from fireworks, state officials said Monday.

A witness reported that the birds, which roost in the area in large numbers and don't see well at night, were scared by the noise and slammed into houses and trees, said Arkansas State Veterinarian George Badley. A study of several carcasses showed the birds died of internal bleeding.

"We're still checking for germs and poisons, but we believe it was just trauma," said Dr. Badley.

Between 1,000 and 5,000 birds died during the incident, which happened in Beebe, a town northeast of Little Rock.

An initial theory was that the birds had been struck by lighting or hit by a hail storm, but officials no longer think that is the case.

Some storms passed through the area, but that was at least 10 hours before the birds dropped from the sky, said Jeff Williams, spokesman for the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission.

"It looks like weather did not have an effect," he said.
