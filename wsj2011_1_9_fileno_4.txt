The scene where a congresswoman was shot Saturday was captured on surveillance video, according to law enforcement officials.

The video shows federal judge  John Roll chatting with an aide to Rep.  Gabrielle Giffords (D. Ariz.) moments before the violence erupts, according to officials. Judge Roll was killed in the attack, along with five others. Ms. Giffords remains in critical condition.

After the shooting, investigators searched a safe connected to the shooting suspect,  Jared Lee Loughner, and found a letter apparently sent to him by Ms. Giffords's office thanking him for previously attending a similar "Congress on your corner" event in 2007.

Much remains unknown about what motivated Mr. Loughner, who is in custody. But the initial evidence, including the constituent letter, has led law enforcement officials to think that the suspect had been thinking about the congresswoman for years, according to people familiar with the case.

Investigators also found paper on which the suspect apparently wrote the word "assassination" and "I planned ahead." The meaning or significance of that writing isn't clear.

The suspect has been uncooperative with investigators, according to law enforcement officials. Charges are expected to be filed later Sunday.

Federal Bureau of Investigation Director  Robert Mueller said the charges would include the attack on Ms. Giffords and Judge Roll and other victims, with later additional charges likely. Investigators seized computers during a search of the suspect's home, and Mr. Mueller said those were being examined.
