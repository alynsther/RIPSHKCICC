Fisk on the Lower East Side functions as part Swedish specialty shop, part cafe. Walk past the front counter selling bread mixes, herring and other treats for table service at the dimly sunlit spot.

On weekends, choose from Fisk's café menu, the brunch menu and the menu at White Slab Palace next door. Swedish-born  Annika Sundvik owns both Fisk and White Slab. 

The $17 brunch prix fixe features variations on eggs Benedict (pickled beets and feta is one), a Swedish-style rolled omelette, and an impressive plate featuring half a lobster, a corn cob, potato and black lumpfish caviar. The brunch set comes with coffee or tea, plus mimosa, bloody mary, or a shot of aquavit. 

"Fisk" being Swedish for "fish," it's natural that herring is the star here. 

The herring platter ($15) lists four kinds, including a house-made version with mustard, but Fisk offers a rotation of up to seven types at a time. It comes with the flat-bread-like knäckebröd, crème fraîche, boiled potatoes and chopped red onions and chives. 

Ms. Sundvik admits that though the herring is popular, it's not for everyone. "If you have it growing up, you become addicted to it," she said. "It's an acquired taste."
