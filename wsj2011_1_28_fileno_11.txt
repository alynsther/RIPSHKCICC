BANGALORE â€“ Cipla Ltd. Friday denied a media report that said the Indian generic drug maker's founders are looking to sell their entire stake in the company. 

"The company would once again like to reiterate that these [sell out] rumors are absolutely baseless and are purely speculative in nature and the company has no intention whatsoever to do any stake sale," Cipla said in a notice sent to the stock exchanges. 

Earlier reports in the local media said the company's founders were in talks to sell their 37% stake to a global pharmaceutical company, citing unnamed banking sources. The report said that Cipla's talks with Merck KGaA seemed to be the most advanced, and that the stake could be valued at 80 billion rupees ($1.76 billion).
