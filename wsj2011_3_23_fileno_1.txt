SAN FRANCISCO—Federal prosecutors Wednesday played a recording for jurors that is a key piece of evidence in their criminal case against ex-baseball star Barry Bonds for allegedly lying to a grand jury about using steroids.

The audio recording played in U.S. District Court was secretly made by Mr. Bonds's ex-business partner and friend, Steve Hoskins, in 2003 as he spoke to Mr. Bonds's then-trainer Greg Anderson.

On the recording, Mr. Hoskins asks Mr. Anderson about complications from improper injections, and about Mr. Anderson's alleged practice of using multiple injection locations. In addition, Mr. Anderson said on the recording that the substances he was administering are undetectable and are the same ones that Marion Jones—the former track star who since admitted to doping—had taken.

Mr. Hoskins also testified Wednesday that he saw Mr. Anderson leave a room with Mr. Bonds while holding a syringe.

Mr. Bonds is charged with lying to a grand jury in 2003 when he said that no one other than his doctors gave him injections, and also for saying he didn't knowingly use steroids or accept human growth hormone from Mr. Anderson. Mr. Anderson has been held in contempt of court for refusing to testify.

Mr. Hoskins said he made the recording because he was concerned about Mr. Bonds's steroid use and wanted to prove to the ballplayer's father, Bobby Bonds, that the son was using the drugs.

Under cross examination by Allen Ruby, a lawyer for Mr. Bonds, Mr. Hoskins denied he made the recording to extort Mr. Bonds, with whom he had an acrimonious split.
