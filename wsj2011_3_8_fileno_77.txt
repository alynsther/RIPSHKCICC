The Miami Heat are not only being beaten—they're apparently being emotionally pummeled by their alarming tendency to brick last-second, potential game-tying or -winning shots.

After both LeBron James and Dwyane Wade failed in the final seconds of Sunday's loss to the Bulls, Miami stands at 1-for-16 on these attempts, including misses in their past 13. Their success rate of 6% is the NBA's worst and far below the league-wide average of 24%. It's enough to make a grown man cry—exactly what Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said his players were doing in the locker room on Sunday.

The league's best mark in clutch last-second shots belongs to the Dallas Mavericks, who are 3-for-4 in such attempts this season. Only one other team, the Golden State Warriors, has made more than half of these attempts.

Six Heat players have combined for that 1-for-16 mark, with James, at 1-for-7, by far the biggest culprit (but also the guy most willing to take the shots). 

With the loss, Miami dropped behind the Bulls in the conference standings and to 0-9 when facing the top two teams in the NBA's Eastern and Western conferences. The Heat haven't beaten a team with a winning record in more than a month. 

The Heat will have to wipe their tears away quickly as they are four losses into an 11-game stretch against winning teams that continues Tuesday night when they host the Trail Blazers.
