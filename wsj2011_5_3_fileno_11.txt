BOGOTA--The mayor of Bogota, a city of more than seven million people, was suspended Tuesday by the government's solicitor general amid a corruption probe that has already led to the arrest of the mayor's brother. 

  Alejandro Ordonez, Colombia's solicitor general, ordered the suspension of  Samuel Moreno, the mayor of Bogota, for three months on charges that he was negligent in overseeing public contracts. 

Mr. Ordonez added that it was a preventive measure and said the mayor wasn't facing criminal charges. 

Mr. Moreno, of the leftist Polo Democratico party, didn't comment on the suspension. The solicitor general has the power to suspend government officials and ban them from office, leaving it to President  Juan Manuel Santos to name a temporary replacement for Mr. Moreno. An interim mayor has yet to be named.

The suspension is the latest episode in a long-simmering corruption scandal that crept closer to the mayor in recent days. 

  Ivan Moreno, the mayor's brother and an influential senator, was arrested last week on influence-peddling charges, which he has denied. 

At the center of the scandal is a series of key infrastructure projects that were allegedly granted by city officials in exchange for payment. The projects were awarded to a conglomerate that proved to be insolvent, leaving essential upgrades for Bogota's main arteries idle for months, spawning major traffic bottlenecks and infuriating the city's residents. 

The corruption scandal and the infrastructure problems have stained a city that was hailed in the past as an example of successful urban renewal projects. After a streak of popular mayors, a recent poll showed Mr. Moreno's disapproval rating among Bogota residents was close to 85%.
