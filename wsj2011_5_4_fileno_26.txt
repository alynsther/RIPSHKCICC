MUMBAI â€“ Indian shares fell for an eighth consecutive session Wednesday, their longest losing streak in more than two years, as investors continued to worry about the impact of the Reserve Bank of India's monetary tightening actions on economic growth. 

The Bombay Stock Exchange's Sensitive Index lost 65.33 points, or 0.4%, to close at 18469.36, after moving between 18339.53 and 18604.36. The benchmark has lost 5.9% in the past eight sessions. 

On the National Stock Exchange, the 50-stock S&P CNX Nifty slipped 28.10 points, or 0.5%, to end at 5537.15. 

Trading was volatile as investors hunted for bargains among select large-cap stocks. Trading volume on the BSE fell to 27.13 billion rupees ($610 million) from Tuesday's 31.04 billion rupees. Gainers lagged decliners 1,105 to 1,697, while 126 stocks were unchanged. 

India's central bank Tuesday raised its lending rate by a sharper-than-expected 0.5 percentage point, triggering a 2.4% fall in the Sensex. The central bank said reining in inflation is the top priority even if there are some short-term costs by way of lower growth. 

Analysts, however, say further sharp falls in shares seem unlikely and investors can look to enter sectors such as banking at bargain prices. 

"At these [Sensex] levels the downside looks limited, and I don't believe the RBI will stick to a hawkish policy stance," said Ambareesh Baliga, chief operating officer at Way2Wealth Securities. 

Of the 30 Sensex constituents, 19 ended lower Wednesday.
