 India Pvt., a unit of Hong Kong-listed CLP Holdings Ltd., said Monday it will set up two new wind farms with a total capacity of 152.8 megawatts. 

The projects will take the company's total wind energy-based capacity to 638.8 MW, CLP Power India said in a statement. 

The utility will set up a 102.4-megawatt wind farm in Jaisalmer district of western Rajasthan state and a 50.4-megawatt project at Nallakonda in Anantapura district of southern Andhra Pradesh state. It has signed an agreement with Enercon India Ltd. for the supply of wind turbines for both the projects, which will be completed by March 2012. 

It didn't give the value of the contract given to Enercon or the total cost of the two projects. 

CLP Power India already has wind power projects in Gujarat, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka states. It also operates a 655-megawatt gas-based power plant at Bharuch in Gujarat and is building a 1,320-megawatt supercritical coal-based power project at Jhajjar in Haryana. 

Several companies are building renewable energy projects in India as the world's fourth-largest emitter of greenhouse gases aims to chart a low-carbon growth strategy due to concerns about energy security, energy efficiency and the environment. 

"We estimate that India's energy efficiency and low-carbon energy production markets will reach $77 billion and $58 billion, respectively, by 2020," HSBC Securities and Capital Markets said in a note in January. 

India's current wind energy capacity is about 12,000 megawatt. Wind-based power generation, of about 17,000 megawatt to 20,000 megawatt, is expected to form the bulk of renewables-based capacity addition in the country in the next five years, according to industry estimates.
