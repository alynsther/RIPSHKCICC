In the wake of Osama bin Laden's death, President Obama's approval rating has risen to its highest level since July 2009 in the new Quinnipiac University poll. But his numbers on managing the economy haven't budged.

The poll of 1,409 Americans finds them favoring the job President Obama is doing by 52% to 40%, up six points from his 46% approval rating in Quinnipiac's last survey, with most of the gains coming from men.

But if the economy is likely to dominate the 2012 elections, Mr. Obama still has some explaining do. By the same 20-point margin in Quinnipiac's last poll, voters disapprove of his handling of the economy. When asked if Mr. Obama deserves re-election, respondents agree by 46% to 42%. That's a measurable but not dramatic increase from the three-point deficit Mr. Obama had on the re-election question in Quinnipiac's last survey.

"The killing of Osama bin Laden has helped President Barack Obama's popularity but not massively," says Peter Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute. "The number of people opposed to his re-election has dropped, although they seem to have moved to 'undecided,' rather than to the pro-Obama column."

The numbers on which party voters trust most to handle the deficit haven't budged much, either. They tipped to Republicans 46% to 42% before bin Laden's death, and 44% to 42% afterwards.
