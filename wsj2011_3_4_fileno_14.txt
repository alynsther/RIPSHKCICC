DUBLIN—Coalition talks between Ireland's Fine Gael and Labour parties are at an advanced stage and an outline agreement has already been reached, Irish state broadcaster RTE reported Friday. 

Labour is said to have compromised on the timescale for cutting Ireland's budget deficit to 3% of gross domestic product, RTE said. 

A Labour Party spokesman told the Wall Street Journal that there were still several issues to be resolved before any coalition deal is completed. 

"There are also issues that may need to be put to the party leaders for approval when they return," he said. 

Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny is in Helsinki at a meeting of the European People's Party, while Labour leader Eamon Gilmore is in Athens at a meeting of European socialist parties. 

A spokesman for Fine Gael wouldn't comment on the RTE report, saying talks were still ongoing. 

The timeline of the deficit reduction has been a contentious issue between the two parties, with Fine Gael saying it will make the cuts by the end of 2014, while Labour says the deadline should be 2016. 

Labour has said that forcing through budget cuts too early could delay an economic recovery in Ireland. 

Under the terms of the €67.5 billion ($94.24 billion) bailout deal Ireland struck with the European Union and International Monetary Fund last November, the country has been given until 2015 to reduce its deficit to 3% of gross domestic product.
