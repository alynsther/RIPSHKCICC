It's been a dismal decade in Italy's Serie A championship for Rome's leading football teams. Lazio and AS Roma won back-to-back scudetto titles from 1999 to 2001, but the country's top division has since been dominated by Juventus, AC Milan and Inter Milan.

The capital's leading clubs have found success easier to come by in the Coppa Italia, the country's premier knockout tournament: Roma lifted the trophy in 2007 and 2008, before Lazio beat Sampdoria on a penalty shootout in the 2009 final.

Rome will have just a single representative in the quarterfinals this year, though, since the two clubs meet for a place in the last eight on Wednesday at the Stadio Olimpico ground that these two shareâ€”and which will stage this year's Coppa Italia final.

Roma secured a 2-0 victory in November's Serie A match between these two teams and Claudio Ranieri's side is favorite to repeat that win here. 

Victor Chandler offers a best-price 21/20 for Roma to win inside 90 minutes. With extra-time and penalties on the cards if the score remains level after 90 minutes, Sportingbet makes Roma 9/20 to advance. 

Despite such short odds, backing Roma to win here is advisable: After a stuttering start which saw the team mired in the relegation zone back in October, Roma has since recovered and climbed to fourth in the Serie A standings following four wins in its last five games.

Lazio is second in the league table after a 1-0 win over Sampdoria on Sunday, but the club hasn't won back-to-back games in nearly three months. Backing Roma to win by one goal at 11/4 could also pay-off: Nine of its 14 wins in all competitions have come by a one-goal margin.
