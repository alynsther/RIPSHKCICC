The U.S. said the photograph of a dead Osama bin Laden is "gruesome" and that "it could be inflammatory" if released, but is still considering whether to make it public. The U.S. also gave fresh details on the raid that killed bin Laden, saying he was unarmed but was resisting when U.S. forces stormed his lair. 

Meanwhile, Pakistan said it had "concerns and reservations" about Washington's decision to kill bin Laden inside Pakistan without giving forewarning. Pakistan has said it didn't know bin Laden was there, but the U.S. is probing what the government knew.
