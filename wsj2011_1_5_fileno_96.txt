On Wednesday, the results of this year's voting for the Baseball Hall of Fame will be announced. One of the players eligible for the first time is Kevin Brown, a truly accomplished pitcher whose lead sinker was one of the best pitches of his or any other time.

Mr. Brown, though, seems doomed to receive less than the 5% of votes from veteran baseball writers necessary to stay on the ballot. When ESPN.com released the ballots of its 18 voters, for instance, he was named on not one of them.

There is no mystery as to why this is so: Mr. Brown had a reputation for difficulty. He once broke his left hand by hitting a wall in frustration and was also named in the Mitchell Report on performance-enhancing drugs. Still, it would be a shame if Mr. Brown's off-field antics got in the way of his résumé.

His career record (211-144, 3.28 ERA) is more or less indistinguishable from those of such Hall of Famers as Don Drysdale (209-166, 2.95) and Jim Bunning (224-184, 3.27). And from 1996 to 2000, Mr. Brown was devastating. During that time he threw 1,209.2 innings with an ERA+ of 165, a statistic that incorporates park effects as well as the league ERA (higher is better). That's on par with Sandy Koufax's best five-year run (167 ERA+). And Mr. Brown also had a season in which he tied for the baseball lead with 21 wins, and another in which he pitched 211 innings with a 2.39 ERA. He was good enough for the Los Angeles Dodgers to make him baseball's first $100 million man.

In all, Mr. Brown was worth 64.8 Wins Above Replacement, which measures how many wins a player is worth over a replacement-level player. That figure tops that of Whitey Ford, Juan Marichal and Jim Palmer.
