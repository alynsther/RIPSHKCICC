Arkansas regulators are seeking to stop two natural-gas drilling companies from injecting wastewater into underground storage wells, as they investigate whether those operations are related to a recent swarm of earthquakes.

Regulators on Wednesday made an emergency request to halt the wastewater-handling operations of  Chesapeake Energy Corp.

 and Clarita Operating LLC. Their wells hold millions of gallons of a liquid mixture used to break apart gas-bearing rock formations.

In a statement, Chesapeake said "we remain very confident that an objective review of the facts and science do not support the proposed action." Clarita declined to comment. 

The Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission last month imposed a six-month moratorium on drilling new water-storage wells, citing "circumstantial evidence" that they enhanced or possibly caused earthquakes in a 576-square mile area. The state has been swept by 900 earthquakes larger than 1.0 magnitude since September, according to the Arkansas Geological Survey.

The commission found no evidence that the seismic activity was related directly to drilling. It will consider a ban on the storage wells Friday.
