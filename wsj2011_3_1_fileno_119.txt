No matter which school enters the NCAA tournament as the No. 1 overall seed, there's one team it doesn't want to see anywhere near its side of the bracket: Virginia Tech.

By guiding the Hokies to an upset of then-No.1 Duke on Saturday, Seth Greenberg established himself as perhaps the sport's best coach against top-ranked opponents. Since taking the job in Blacksburg before the 2003-04 season, Greenberg has beaten the No. 1 team three times—tied for the most of any coach during that span. (He also led Long Beach State to a win over No. 1 Kansas in 1993.)

Taken at face value, Greenberg's 3-3 record against the nation's elite while at Va. Tech falls short of that of Ohio State's Thad Matta (3-2) and North Carolina's Roy Williams (3-1). But considering Greenberg coaches at a middling basketball school that has gone to the NCAA tournament just once since 1997, he deserves special consideration.

Through Sunday, the Hokies have compiled a 151-102 record (.597) under Greenberg. Over that time, Williams has gone 218-60 (.784) at UNC, while Matta has gone 209-67 (.757) at Xavier and OSU. Louisville's Rick Pitino and Florida State's Leonard Hamilton—the other two coaches with 3-3 records against No. 1 teams since '03-'04—also have better overall winning percentages.

The Hokies seem poised to reach the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2007, but at 19-8, they probably won't earn a particularly high seed. Judging by Greenberg's track record, that suits them just fine.
