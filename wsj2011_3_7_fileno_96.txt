UDR's purchase of 10 Hanover Square, expected to close within 60 days, comes as Manhattan rents are rising.

While Manhattan's rents softened following the financial crisis, the market is improving as renters feel confident enough to sign leases. In many cases, concessions—the freebies landlords throw in to attract tenants—have disappeared. Year-over-year comparisons show prices up 8.01% on average, according to the Real Estate Group NY's February report. The average rent for a one-bedroom unit with a doorman was $3,560 in February, a gain of more than 10% from a year earlier. Two-bedroom units saw an 8.4% increase.

Denver-based UDR has been reshaping its portfolio with a focus on harder-to-enter markets with higher rents. By buying its first Manhattan property, the real-estate investment trust is entering one of the nation's strongest markets, where consumers typically rent well into their 30s. In the fourth quarter, New York's vacancy rate was 3.2%, below the national rate of 6.6%, according to  Reis Inc.

UDR says monthly revenue from the 493 units at Hanover Square average $3,000 each.

UDR, which controls nearly 60,000 units in 13 states and Washington, D.C., is paying seller Witkoff Group $484,000 per unit. The site also includes 41,650 square feet of retail space with tenants including Apple Bank and  Starbucks.

The purchase price includes assuming a $192 million mortgage, the issuance of approximately $64.3 million of operating partnership units and about $4.5 million in cash.

Investor demand for apartment buildings has been heating up throughout the country, partly because people who were closed out of the home-buying market have turned into renters. Demand for buildings is particularly acute in hot markets such as New York, where, in some cases, building prices have reached levels last seen in mid-2007

Other big public companies also have been increasing their interest in New York City apartment buildings. For example, Chicago-based  Equity Residential,

 which entered the New York market in 2004, last year announced it was buying developer  Harry Macklowe's last three Manhattan apartment buildings for $475 million. Equity Residential also is working on development here.

According to the Real Estate Group NY report, the priciest one-bedrooms with a doorman were found in SoHo, while Harlem had the cheapest. The Financial District, an area hard hit from the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, saw strong gains as it continues healing. In February, one-bedroom doorman units were an average $3,544, up nearly 12% from a year earlier, according to the report based on data taken from more than 10,000 listings below 155th Street and priced under $10,000.
