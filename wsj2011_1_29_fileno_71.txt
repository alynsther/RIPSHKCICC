A "change-of-plea" court hearing has been scheduled for Tuesday for a Pennsylvania woman who previously pleaded not guilty to U.S. charges that she conspired to wage jihad abroad, including a plot to kill a Swedish cartoonist whose work offended some Muslims. 

It wasn't immediately clear whether the woman, Colleen LaRose, would now plead guilty to some or all of the charges, or if a plea agreement had been reached with prosecutors. 

A spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Philadelphia declined to comment, and Ms. LaRose's attorneys couldn't be reached Friday. 

The hearing is set for Tuesday afternoon in federal court in Philadelphia, according to a document issued by a judge's deputy Friday. 

Ms. LaRose, of Pennsburg, Pa., was charged with conspiracy to provide support to terrorists, conspiracy to kill in a foreign country and related accusations. She has been held at a federal detention center since she was arrested in 2009. She pleaded not guilty to the charges in a courtroom appearance last year. 

Ms. LaRose allegedly used the online aliases "JihadJane" and "Fatima LaRose" in trying to recruit people via the Internet to support and commit violent acts in South Asia and Europe. She allegedly traveled to Europe in 2009 with the intent to train with jihadists and track down the Swedish cartoonist. 

Prosecutors have said Ms. LaRose was a convert to Islam, and that she intended to exploit her Western appearance to avoid suspicion in carrying out her plans. 

Prosecutors also charged Jamie Paulin Ramirez, formerly of Colorado, with participating in the same conspiracy as Ms. LaRose.
