NEW DELHI â€“  Siemens Ltd. Thursday posted a better-than-expected 54% increase in its net profit for the fiscal second quarter, driven by strong performances at all its divisions. 

The Indian unit of German engineering company Siemens AG posted a net profit of 2.78 billion rupees ($62.3 million) for January-March, compared with 1.81 billion rupees a year earlier. 

The average of estimates in a poll of four analysts was for profit to rise 32% to 2.38 billion rupees. 

Sales rose 37% to 30.34 billion rupees from 22.12 billion rupees.

Siemens, in line with engineering peers ABB Ltd. (India) and Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd., has managed to grow its revenue and profit due to swift execution of projects, especially in the energy sector. 

Indian state-run and private sector companies are racing to set up power plants to bridge a wide gap in electricity demand and supply. 

Siemens grew sales of its power division by 73% in the second quarter to 17.55 billion rupees. Sales at its industrial and healthcare equipment divisions also rose in the past quarter. 

Managing Director  Armin Bruck said while the company is confident of sustained growth, it is "closely managing" the challenge of inflation and a consequent rise in costs. 

The company said its order book was worth 154.18 billion rupees as of March 31, up 15% from a year earlier.
