 and  NYSE Euronext exchanges won't be simple and could go into an in-depth phase of analysis, European Competition Commissioner  Joaquín Almunia said Tuesday. 

"This analysis will not be a simple one," Mr. Almunia told a European Parliament committee. "I will not be surprised if this merger, once it's notified, will be one of those cases where we are obliged to go into phase II." 

His comment refers to a phase of analysis for merger cases where the commission—which has antitrust powers within the EU—undertakes a more thorough investigation of a proposed operation. 

Mr. Almunia also said the two parties, who haven't yet notified the commission of the merger, have expressed to him the intention to do so "in due course." 

Under EU rules, the commission only has jurisdiction if the companies involved have sufficiently large revenue in more than one EU country, and the parties involved have the responsibility to notify the operation to the EU, if they deem it necessary. 

At that point, the commission has 25 working days to consider a merger but can seek an additional 90 working days to mull a deal if it goes through a Phase II process. 

It can then clear the operation, or set conditions, like the selling of some assets, to solve competition concerns. It could also block the deal if it considers that no commitment by the companies involved would solve its concerns, but that has happened only very rarely.
