A new jury of seven women and two men was sworn in Wednesday in the  Nancy Kissel "Milkshake Murder" retrial, allowing proceedings to resume.

Judge  Andrew Macrae dismissed the previous jury Wednesday morning and ordered selection to begin again. The original jury of five men and four women was selected Tuesday morning, but that afternoon one member was dismissed and replaced, after which the prosecution began its opening argument.

Judge Macrae cited an Australian precedent in issuing his decision to select a new jury. Procedural flaws in the original trial had been cited by Hong Kong's Court of Final Appeal when it overturned Ms. Kissel's 2005 murder conviction and ordered a new trial last year.

Ms. Kissel Tuesday pleaded guilty to a charge of manslaughter but not guilty to murder in the 2003 death of her husband. In the original trial, she said she acted in self-defense after suffering years of physical and sexual abuse.

The retrial is expected to last 50 days.
