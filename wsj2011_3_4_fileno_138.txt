Royal connections add zest to Kerry Taylor Auctions' "Passion for Fashion" sale March 17.

Included in the 293-lot auction will be the see-through dress modeled by Kate Middleton at the annual University of St. Andrew's charity fashion show in 2002. St. Andrews is the university in Scotland where romance blossomed between students Prince William and Ms. Middleton. Their wedding will take place April 29 in Westminster Abbey.

The simple garment of gossamer-fine gold and black knitted silk with a peacock-blue hem slotted through with a ribbon was designed by Charlotte Todd. Ms. Todd conceived the dress when working on a St. Andrew's student project entitled "The Art of Seduction." It cost her around £20 to make. With royal wedding bells about to ring, Kerry Taylor has estimated the dress at £8,000-£10,000. "Royalty is a plus, and with the wedding, this year is special," Ms. Taylor says.

Unique gowns made for Princess Diana also will feature in the sale. A lovely pink chiffon dinner dress by Zandra Rhodes, which was worn by the late princess on an official visit to Japan in 1986, is expected to fetch between £30,000 and £40,000. 

Meanwhile, a white, lace evening gown with a formal, elongated silhouette, designed by the late Catherine Walker for a state visit by the princess to France in 1988, is estimated at £40,000-£60,000.

In addition, there will be accessories, jewelry and lingerie that come from the wardrobe of the Duchess of Windsor, the twice-divorced American socialite, then known as Wallis Simpson, for whom King Edward VIII of England gave up the British throne in 1936. 

The items have been stored in the Windsors' home in the Bois de Boulogne, Paris, since her death in 1986. Among the pieces will be a scarlet chiffon nightdress from the late 1940s-early 1950s (estimate: £600-£1,000); and a delicate, ivory chiffon nightdress with pleats falling to the floor, from the 1950s (estimate: £350-£500). There are a number of bags from the greatest of fashion designers, including a black, briefcase-like crocodile handbag from circa 1964 by Christian Dior, estimated at £8,000-£12,000. The duchess's Dior toque hat with an ocelot brim, from 1956-1959, will be on the block with an estimate of £400-£600.

Looking generally at the sale, there will be an impressive range of haute couture gowns from Dior, Balenciaga, Chanel, Yves Saint Laurent, among others.

Particularly noteworthy will be a "Mondrian" silk dress (1965) by Saint Laurent. The dress is based on the paintings of famed Dutch abstract, geometric painter Piet Mondrian. The sharp, clean Mondrian dress collection became synonymous with all that was young and cool in the "Swinging Sixties," says Ms. Taylor. "It is an incredible piece, not just a Saint Laurent but a signature Saint Laurent. I want the dress to go to someone who will love it."

To find an original of this dress is extremely rare; and there are believed to be only two in silk, the other being in the Victoria & Albert Museum in London. The Mondrian dress, which is estimated at £25,000-£35,000, comes from noted American fashion collector and author Sandy Schreier. This is the first time that Ms. Schreier has offered a piece from her collection, which includes thousands of museum-quality French couture and British and American fashion items.

Meanwhile, on March 11 at the Hotel Drouot in Paris, Art Curial will hold a 477-lot sale devoted to fashion masters Chanel and Louis Vuitton. On sale will be accessories from the 1960s into the 21st century. "We have amazing demand for pieces," specialist Cyril Pigot says. 

Among the accessories will be a Vuitton special-edition purse created in 1996 in monogram canvas with panther print and inside pouches for condoms and cosmetics (estimate: €2,500-€3,000); a Vuitton tote bag from 2005 decorated with cherries by Japanese artist Takashi Murakami (estimate: €850-€900); and a big Chanel canvas bag with red and beige stripes from circa 2000 (estimate: €900-€1,000).
