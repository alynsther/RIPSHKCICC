By signing Carlos Gonzalez to a seven-year, $80.5 million contract Tuesday, the Rockies announced they believe their young outfielder will repeat his MVP-caliber 2010 season. They also took a historic gamble.

Mr. Gonzalez became the least experienced player in baseball history to receive such a lengthy and lucrative deal, according to Cot's Baseball Contracts, a website that tracks MLB contracts. The 25-year-old has played in 319 big-league games through parts of three seasons.

The good news for Rockies fans is that Mr. Gonzalez is in excellent company. Previously, the least experienced player to sign a deal of at least seven years and $70 million was Chase Utley. He inked a seven-year, $85 million deal after playing 444 games. Likewise, Albert Pujols played 475 games before earning a seven-year, $100 million extension in 2004. 

Other teams in recent years have locked their budding stars into long-term contracts, but paid significantly less. The Brewers gave Ryan Braun an eight-year contract in his second season, but will pay $45 million. The Rays took a similar approach with Evan Longoria, signing him to an option-laden deal during his rookie campaign that tops at nine years, $44.5 million.

But the size of the Gonzalez deal is nothing new for Colorado. The team gave Troy Tulowitzki a six-year deal after he played 180 games, then signed him this winter to a six-year, $120 million extension that will keep him in Denver until 2020. Colorado also signed the young Todd Helton to a nine-year pact in 2001 after he played just 506 games.
