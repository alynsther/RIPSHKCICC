After a long rivalry as European superstars, Red Bulls star Thierry Henry and Los Angeles Galaxy midfielder David Beckham will clash in America for the first time at 11 p.m. EDT Saturday in Los Angeles. The two were focal points of a heated rivalry a decade ago, when Beckham starred for Manchester United and Henry played for London's Arsenal. Henry was injured last September when the two teams played. Aside from the star power, it's also a matchup of two elite teams. The Red Bulls are first in the Eastern Conference with 14 points in seven games. The Galaxy lead the West with 15 points in nine games. 



The Rangers are out of the playoffs, but their 20-year-old center Derek Stepan is coming through in pressure-packed situations—sadly for the Blueshirts, it's in Slovakia, not at the Garden. In the second round of the ice hockey world championships on Friday, Team USA's Stepan scored his first goal of the tournament, a third-period, game-tying goal to force overtime in a 4-3 win for Canada. Canada's John Tavares, an Islanders center, scored a third-period goal as well.

If Mets third baseman David Wright isn't off to his best start as a hitter—his batting average is just .250 and his on-base-plus-slugging a mediocre .778—he can take solace in being among the most efficient base-stealers in baseball this season. Entering Friday, Wright was 8-for-8 in stolen-base attempts, making him one of only four players in the majors who had tried to steal at least eight times and hadn't been thrown out. The Astros' Michael Bourn (11), the Padres' Orlando Hudson (10) and the Rangers' Elvis Andrus (eight) are the others.
