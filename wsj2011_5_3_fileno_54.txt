  Research In Motion Ltd. executives defended their product strategy and showed off a new touchscreen BlackBerry, as the company struggles to regain its footing in the competitive U.S. market.

"The world is changing and we're doing all we can to prepare RIM for it,"  Mike Lazaridis, RIM's co-chief executive, said at the company's annual user conference, known as BlackBerry World, which kicked off Monday in Orlando, Fla. 

RIM Monday showed an updated BlackBerry Bold smartphone, which will have a touchscreen as well as a keyboard. RIM also added video chat software to its PlayBook tablet, which launched April 19. 

With the announcements, RIM is hoping to erase the bitter aftertaste left by last week's first-quarter earnings warning, which it blamed on weaker than expected BlackBerry sales and sent RIM shares plunging Friday. 

RIM's stock fell 1% to $48.10 at 4 p.m. Monday on the Nasdaq.

In response Monday to a question from the audience, in which an analyst said RIM managers were behaving as if nothing was wrong, Mr. Lazaridis said, "I hope you don't get a sense that I'm ignoring what's happened ... I live it everyday." 

Mr. Lazaridis said RIM is doing its best to maintain growth and prepare for the future. "If you want an apology for being late on some of our products, I can give that to you, but it's not because we weren't working hard. It's because we wanted to bring the best possible product to market. Sometimes that doesn't fit nicely" into a quarterly earnings period, he added. 

At 10.5 millimeters, the newest Bold device is the thinnest BlackBerry, though it is slightly thicker than  Apple Inc.

's iPhone 4. It is expected to be available this summer, but pricing wasn't provided. The device will also offer support for near-field communications, which allows consumers to use their smartphones as so-called mobile wallets. 

RIM said the new Bold will run on the latest version of its BlackBerry operating system, known as BlackBerry 7.0. 

The company is also working on new line of devices for next year that will run on different software called QNX, which is what the PlayBook uses.

RIM, Waterloo, Ontario, has been losing share the past several quarters in North America to the iPhone and devices running on  Google Inc.'s Android operating system. The company has continued to increase sales thanks largely to shipments of less expensive models in overseas markets. 

Some attendees at the conference said they were pleased with the newBold.  Brian Hajost, chief executive of Steel Cloud, a Virginia company that builds appliances for BlackBerry Enterprise Servers, said the iPhone does touch well, but if a user wants a physical keyboard, the combination offered by the Bold is "an absolute winner." 

The new Bold will have a faster Web browser and new icons that make it easier to navigate on the device, said Andrew Blocking, a RIM vice president told reporters Monday. 

Mr. Blocking said the BlackBerry 7.0 software will only be available on new BlackBerrys, and cannot be downloaded for devices that have already been released, such as the BlackBerry Torch. He said third-party applications built for BlackBerry 6.0 can be easily ported to BlackBerry 7.0-based devices. 

BlackBerry 7.0 has not been integrated yet with RIM's QNX operating system, which powers the PlayBook. RIM has indicated that it will launch QNX-based BlackBerrys early next year.
