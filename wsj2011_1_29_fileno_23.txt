Mike Dunleavy scored 30 points to help the Indiana Pacers beat the Nets on Friday night to snap a six-game losing streak.

It was Indiana's second-best scoring effort of the season, behind its NBA season-high, 144-point outburst Nov. 9 against Denver.

Brook Lopez led the Nets with 28 points. New Jersey had won four of its past five games, but allowed its highest point total of the season.
