Take the best types of specialty shops in Italy and France, throw in a restaurant, and you've got Sátis.

The new restaurant in Jersey City's quaint Paulus Hook neighborhood offers crepes, gelato and specialty cheeses and meats, alongside their takes on classic dishes from France, Italy and Spain.

The braised-beef short rib with Boursin scrambled eggs ($14)—the restaurant's version of steak and eggs—is so popular that co-owner  Mike Garcia is considering keeping it as he adjusts the menu to accommodate spring ingredients. Same for the candied-orange and ricotta-stuffed brioche French toast ($10), with amaretto honey and toasted almonds. It's labor-intensive, Mr. Garcia said, but worth it. But the menu's distinguishing feature is its assortment of meats and cheeses. ($6-$9 per meat or cheese, or $24 for a chef's selection of four.)

The dishes are on the smaller side, leaving room to explore the mini salumeria in the back. Limited-time specials included Iberian ham and Mangalitsa, a woolly Hungarian pig. ("A hideous creature, but it tastes divine," Mr. Garcia said.)

The BYOB bistro provides carafes of fresh orange juice ($10) for mimosas; a liquor store is just down the block.

 Sátis, 212 Washington Street in Jersey City, 201-435-5151, serves brunch on Saturdays and Sundays from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.
