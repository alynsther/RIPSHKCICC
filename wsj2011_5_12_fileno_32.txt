, in a divestment that will raise about US$150 million, a person familiar with the transaction said on Thursday, prompting a sharp decline in the shares of the Chinese property company. 

Temasek, which bought the stake in 2007, sold its holding at a 10% discount to Wednesday's closing price of HK$3.39 ($0.44), the person said. 

Kaisa Group shares fell 18% to HK$2.78 as of 3.30pm local time and was the most heavily traded stock in Hong Kong's main bourse. The divestment comes after the stock had risen more than 50% from a year-to-date low of HK$2.21 on March 1. 

In a filing to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, Kaisa Group said that it wasn't aware of the reasons for the "unusual changes" in the price and trading volumes. "The directors are only made aware from the market news today that one of the company's existing shareholders has sold down its interest in the company to third-party investors," Kaisa said in its filing. 

The move to divest from Kaisa comes amid fears of further rate tightening measures in China to cool soaring property prices. 

Temasek has made several other significant divestments in the past year. In October, Temasek sold its 9.6% stake in South Korea's Hana Financial Group Inc. in a transaction that raised US$642.6 million. In July, Temasek sold its 14.7% stake in Singapore's Fraser & Neave Ltd. to Japan's Kirin Holdings Co. Ltd. for US$968.3 million.
