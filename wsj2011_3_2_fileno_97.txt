The hottest teams in Spanish football face off Wednesday when Barcelona visits Valencia in a game that could have a major bearing on the shakeup at the top of La Liga.

Barcelona has picked off opponents at will this season, and has now gone 23 games since it suffered its one and only defeat against Hercules. Meanwhile, Valencia enters this game with the division's second-longest unbeaten streak, which now stretches to 11 matches.

Even accounting for Valencia's recent form and homefield advantage, oddsmakers expect a one-sided contest. Valencia is as long as 5/1 to beat Barça, while the country's third-placed club is given little hope of holding the league leader either, with the draw available at 16/5.

It's easy to see why: Barça has failed to win just one road game this season, a 1-1 stalemate with Sporting Gijon. Even then, head coach Josep 'Pep' Guardiola fielded an understrength team on that occasion and the result came against the run of play: Barça had 15 shots during the game, with six on target, and ended the game with 81% possession. Even at 8/13, backing Barça to claim three points against Valencia is recommended.

On Thursday, Real Madrid takes on strugglers Málaga, and José Mourinho's team can't afford another slip-up after a goalless draw at Deportivo La Coruna last weekend. In the Santiago Bernabéu, where Madrid hasn't lost in the league, a home win is seen as a formality. Rather than take 2/11 for that, consider an accumulator with Barcelona at around 9/10.
