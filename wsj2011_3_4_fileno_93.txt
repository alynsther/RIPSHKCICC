Although speculation swirled this winter that Johnny Damon might make his return to New York as a free agent and become the Yankees' fourth outfielder, Damon said Thursday that a New York reunion was never likely. 

"I don't really think it was close at all," Damon said. "I think they were very happy with their outfield situation and thought [Jorge] Posada was not going to be catching much. It really made it easy as far as their decision and as far as mine."

The Yankees settled on Andruw Jones as their fourth outfielder, which was fine with Damon, who signed with Tampa Bay and will play more often as a result. 

"I'm not ready to be a part-time player in this game. I feel like I have a few more years of playing every day,'' he said.

Oliver Perez gave himself a stay of execution Thursday by throwing two scoreless innings in the Mets' exhibition game against the Cardinals. Perez, who is in danger of being released this spring, rebounded from a rocky first spring outing by allowing just two hits and no walks. His velocity still did not top 87 mph, though. "I know my velocity is not there," Perez said. "I'm just trying to find a way to get outs."
