Japanese shares fell Monday as high levels of radioactivity hindered work at the damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power facility, while Hong Kong and Taiwanese stocks lost ground after some earnings reports fell short of estimates.

Chinese and Indian stocks advanced, driven by hopes for strong corporate earnings. But the nuclear developments in Japan, political unrest in the Mideast and North Africa, and the loss by German Chancellor Angela Merkel's party in Sunday's regional elections kept investors cautious.

Japan's Nikkei Stock Average fell 0.6% to end at 9,478.53 as repair crews at the troubled nuclear power facility struggled to make headway amid news that radioactivity levels in a pool of water inside one of the buildings had reached 100,000 times the normal level.

"Developments in Japan remain challenging...In recent days, radiation levels at the facility have risen again, suggesting that hope for a relatively quick resolution that emerged early last week might have been premature," Frederic Neumann, HSBC's co-head of Asian economics research, wrote in a note to clients.

Shares of Tokyo Electric Power Co. owner of the stricken nuclear plant, tumbled another 17.7% to bring its losses so far in March to more than 67%.

Several exporters also declined, finding little support despite a weakened yen, with Advantest Corp. sinking 4.9% and Sony Corp. falling 1.3%. But some car makers rose, with Nissan Motor Co. gaining 3.5% as it restarted production. 

Elsewhere , Australia's S&P/ASX 200 slipped 0.2% to 4,733.6, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index gave up 0.4% to 23,068.19 and Taiwan's Taiex shed 0.7% to 8,553.06.

Chinese banks helped Shanghai shares move higher on expectations for strong earnings from the five major banks due to release their annual reports this week.

Technology shares weighed on Taiwanese shares after Acer Inc. cut its revenue outlook for the first quarter of 2011. The computer maker said Friday that it expects revenue to drop 10% in the first quarter of this year, from the fourth quarter, due to sluggish demand in European and U.S. markets. Acer's stock tumbled 6.9%, while Asustek Computer Inc. fell 5.7%.

In foreign-exchange markets, the dollar extended Friday's gains on the back of stronger-than-expected U.S. economic growth data and comments from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia president that the Fed should raise interest rates from a current range near zero to 2.5% within a year, starting "in the not-too-distant future."

The euro, meanwhile, lost ground after election results in Germany and on concerns about the euro-zone's sovereign-debt crisis, with investors focusing on Ireland and Portugal.

"The underlying problems of excessive debt in the peripheral (European) economies and fears over bank exposure continue. Combined with fiscal austerity, we remain skeptical that the euro can sustain its current levels," said UBS currency strategist Mansoor Mohiuddin.

Credit Agricole wrote in a note to clients that the yen's moves this week "might be characterized by the ongoing battle between repatriation fans and the threat of further G-7 intervention."
