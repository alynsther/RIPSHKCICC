During World War I German artist Kurt Schwitters used train tickets and candy wrappers for his Modernist collages. World War II bombs destroyed his signature work, a room-size sculptural installation built over 15 years in Hannover. A replica of the room is included among the 100 items in "Kurt Schwitters: Color and Collage."
