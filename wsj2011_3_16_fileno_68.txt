, and is planning to launch a binding offer soon, a person familiar with the matter said on Monday.

The final bid is likely to be launched through unlisted group company Essel Mining & Industries Ltd., the person told Dow Jones Newswires, but asked not to be named.

The person however didn't specify the number or names of other shortlisted bidders.

The planned bid comes as Indian firms scramble to secure scarce coal assets to feed growing demand from the rapidly expanding power and mining sectors.

The planned Birla bid follows comments by a competing Korean consortium indicating that it plans to exit the race for the Australian firm, which has been valued at $3.5 billion, after submitting a non-binding offer earlier in the year.

Whitehaven, which produces coking coal used in steelmaking and thermal coal used in power generation from mines in New South Wales state, put itself up for sale last year. The firm had said early in February that it had short-listed a number of firms on the basis of non-binding offers.

The race to secure coal has already resulted in a wave of multi billion dollar mergers and acquisitions activity globally, much of it driven by increasing consumption in emerging economic giants China and India.

Recent Indian acquisitions of coal assets include JSW Energy Ltd.'s $422 million purchase of Canada-based CIC Energy and Lanco Infratech Ltd.'s acquisition of Australia-based Griffin Coal's mining assets. Anglo-Australian mining giant  Rio Tinto
