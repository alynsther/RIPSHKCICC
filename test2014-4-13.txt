KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia—Authorities are consulting with international legal
experts to consider which country should get custody of the black boxes from
Flight 370 if they are located and retrieved from the Indian Ocean, Defense
Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said Sunday.

Precedent in past airline crashes would give the country overseeing the
search—in this case, Malaysia—authority to determine how the black boxes are
recovered and analyzed. Kuala Lumpur has so far delegated large parts of the
search and investigation to...

Leading members of New Jersey's legal community are moving to limit the
governor's power to remove a state Supreme Court justice, a restriction they
say is needed to help preserve judicial independence amid concerns that the
court is being engulfed by partisan politics.

On Friday, the New Jersey State Bar Association, which represents more than
18,000 lawyers in the state, adopted a resolution calling for a constitutional
amendment...

MORKAHI, India—As a teenager, Ram Singh left this remote rural village and
moved to fast-growing New Delhi to chase the spoils of his country's economic
boom.

For 14 years, he toiled in tiny, primitive factories making everything from
auto parts to components for light switches. His wages barely kept pace with
the cost of living and eventually...

Kathleen Sebelius has been let out a rear door of the Health and Human
Services Department, and her exit is an opportunity for getting some ObamaCare
accountability. President Obama tapped Sylvia Mathews Burwell as her
replacement on Friday. The Senate should try to use her confirmation to expose
the law's continuing troubles and improve HHS transparency.

Ms. Burwell, the White House budget director, was confirmed for that job 96-0
last April. But the bureaucratic sprawl of HHS deserves more than another

Jordan Spieth had been saying for weeks that his goal for his first Masters
was to be in the hunt come Sunday. "Not just as a goal to get into contention,
but to see how I can perform on a Sunday," he said. Opening rounds of 71, 70
and 70 put him into the final twosome with Bubba Watson and gave him the
chance he wanted.

Spieth, 20, who was trying to become the youngest Masters winner ever, ended
up losing by three strokes to Watson, but resolutely refused to collapse after
a swift and potentially devastating change of fortune on the eighth and ninth
holes toppled him from the Masters lead by two strokes to two behind Watson.

In warm ups and on the first few holes, Spieth was understandably tight. He
pulled his first two drives. But an easy birdie on the par-five second, a
hole-out birdie from the bunker on 4 and birdies on 6 and 7 gave Spieth what
he called "a dream start on Sunday at Augusta."

the pending final round after the third round of the U.S. Masters at August
National Golf Club. Photo: AP

The four-stroke turnaround would have left many veterans dazed and confused,
but Spieth, with the confidence that his ability justifies, chose to see his
bogeys on 8 and 9 as bad things happening to good shots, and Watson's
countering birdies simply as the nature of golf. A short pitch into the 8th
green that didn't roll out was inexplicable, given the firmness of the greens.
His nine-iron approach into nine, which rolled back down the green's false
front, might have been perfect but for an untimely gust of wind.

"When I got to the 10th tee box, I still felt like I could win the
tournament," he said. "I felt comfortable and confident." He gutted out a par
on the 10th, nearly birdied the 11th and recovered courageously, for his only
bogey on the back nine, after his tee shot on 12 took a dip in Rae's Creek.

"Ultimately, hats off to Bubba," Spieth said. "It stings right now, but the
only thing I'm thinking about now is getting back next year. I can take a ton
of positives out of this week. I feel like I'm ready to win."

Just a hunch. That will be the last time you see Spieth at the top of the
leaderboard in a major.

It probably won't even be the last time this year. That young man is for real.

WASHINGTON—The Obama administration is trying to unilaterally ratchet up
pressure on Russia as it leans on global powers to back harsher sanctions
should Moscow continue to stir trouble in Ukraine.

At the same time, a set of weekend meetings in Washington of the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank showcased the reluctance of European allies
to impose stronger measures against Moscow. Concern runs high in Europe about

Steve Dogiakos, 29, and his wife, Sandra, 30, hope to start a family soon. But
they'd rather do so as home owners than as renters; the couple rents a three-
bedroom house from Ms. Dogiakos's mother in Choteau, Mont.

The couple expects to pull in a combined $43,000 this year. Mr. Dogiakos earns
about $36,000 as a full-time political operative, and makes another few
thousand a year with his Web-design business, he says. Ms. Dogiakos...

Twenty-five years ago this month, the movie "Major League" made its premiere
in theaters, becoming a box-office hit and one of the most celebrated sports
movies of all time.

BILLY HAMILTON: Reds (as Hayes): The light-hitting rookie had 155 stolen bases
in Double-A in 2012.  Associated Press

"Major League" was followed by two forgettable sequels, but what if Hollywood
wanted a remake? In honor of the film's anniversary, here are some current
major-league players who could be cast in a modern-day "Major League."

**Willie Mays Hayes, CF** **   
Billy Hamilton, Cincinnati**

Like Hayes (played by Wesley Snipes), Hamilton is a prolific speedster. He set
a minor-league record with 155 stolen bases between High-A and Double-A ball
in 2012 (no word on whether he, like Hayes, nailed his batting gloves to a
wall for every base he swiped). Also, like Hayes, Hamilton isn't as formidable
with his bat. Through Cincinnati's first 12 games this year, he had six hits
in 39 at-bats (.154), recalling manager Lou Brown's response to Hayes's
declaration that he runs like Hayes and hits like Mays: "You may run like
Hayes, but you hit like…"

YOENIS CESPEDES: Athletics (as Cerrano): The Cuban import has struggled to hit
curveballs as a pro. Associated Press

**Pedro Cerrano, OF** **   
Yoenis Cespedes, Oakland**

Like Cerrano (Dennis Haysbert), Cespedes is a Cuban defector who hits for
power. But the similarities don't end there. In the movie, Cerrano describes
his fatal flaw this way: "Bats, they are sick. I cannot hit curveball.
Straight ball I hit it very much. Curveball, bats are afraid." Cespedes can
relate. For all his talent, his .161 batting average against curveballs last
season ranked among the worst in the majors, according to Inside Edge.
Somewhere, a voodoo doll named Jobu waits for Cespedes to offer rum.

At age 40, Colon's fastball isn't quite what it used to be. But like Harris
(Chelcie Ross), he's been crafty enough to stay in the majors. In the movie,
Harris describes the not-quite-legal substances he uses to get extra break on
the ball: Crisco, Bardol, Vagisil and his own snot. Colon has used some
substances of his own: He was suspended for 50 games in 2012 after testing
positive for testosterone.

**Ricky "Wild Thing" Vaughn, SP** **   
Jeff Samardzija, Chicago Cubs**

Both have nontraditional backgrounds: One came from Notre Dame football, the
other from the California Penal League. Like Vaughn (Charlie Sheen),
Samardzija is a flame-thrower; his average fastball velocity last season, 94.6
mph, was tied for fourth-highest among pitchers with enough innings to qualify
for an ERA title. And like Vaughn, he can be erratic. Samardzija plunked eight
batters last year and threw 11 wild pitches.

Ryan Zimmerman, Washington**

With a $100 million contract, Zimmerman could live Dorn's (Corbin Bernsen)
dream life—golfing, playing the stock market and interior decorating. But
Zimmerman, a former All-Star, still needs to play the field, and his defense
has been Dorn-like at times. His 42 errors since 2012 are the second-most
among third basemen (granted, they have more to do with throwing than
fielding, which was Dorn's problem).

**Jake Taylor, C** **   
A.J. Pierzynski, Boston**

At age 37, he's a far cry from the All-Star he used to be, but like Taylor
(Tom Berenger), Pierzynski still has some good baseball left in him. If a team
needed someone to go over to Dorn's house and chew him out for his fielding,
they couldn't do much better than the fiery Pierzynski.

These days Mark Anthony and his family live paycheck to paycheck.

It may seem like a great idea: Parents, either because they want to help their

ownership of their home to their kids.

Well, it may seem like a great idea. But it often isn't.

For starters, parents often don't realize the security they're giving up,
especially if they plan to continue living in the home. If your child were to

LONDON—The sight of Mo Farah grimacing with his hands on his knees, defeated
and exhausted, is an unfamiliar one in this city. Two years ago, when he lit
up London with electric performances in the Olympic 5,000 and 10,000 meters,
he touched off an ecstatic celebration. There was even frenzied talk of a
knighthood.

So Farah's marathon debut was never going to be in any city but this one. But
when he crossed the finish line here on Sunday, staring at his hometown
asphalt, he could only muster a couple of waves to the crowd. The show was
already over. The winner, Wilson Kipsang of Kenya, had finished almost four
minutes earlier in 2 hours 4 minutes 29 seconds.

"That was tough," Farah said. "I'm very disappointed. I didn't really know
what to expect. Training went well. The crowds were exciting and really helped
me along. It was a little bit windy and I didn't really have a plan."

Kipsang's compatriot, Stanley Biwott, was second in 2:04:55, with Tsegaye
Kebede of Ethiopia another 95 seconds adrift. Farah's final time was 2:08:21,
good enough for eighth place.

Kenyans also dominated the women's race with a one-two finish from Edna
Kiplagat in 2:13:02 and Florence Kiplagat (no relation). Tirunesh Dibaba was
third.

Farah spent much of the week tempering expectations—something the thousands of
flag-waving fans lining the streets of London happily chose to ignore. Britain
hasn't had a real hometown contender in the men's race in more than two
decades. Britain's Paula Radcliffe is a three-time winner of the London
Marathon on the women's side and her 2003 finish in this race still stands as
the world record.

But the signs were against him. Farah never broke the hour mark in either of
his competitive half-marathons. And his performance at the New York City Half-
Marathon made for worrisome viewing. He was undone there by a fall midway
through and then collapsed at the finish line.

Rather than win his first time out here, Farah said he was targeting the 29
-year-old British marathon record of 2:07:13, set by  Steve Jones.

The race was always going to be much faster than that. Especially with former
world-record holder Haile Gebrselassie, 41, as a pacemaker.

When the leading pack took off immediately at blistering speed, Farah stuck to
his own conservative plan and let it go. He said after the race that not
following them might have been a mistake, if only because it left him running
alone, without anyone to pace him for a large chunk of the course.

Graduating from the track to immediate success over 26.2 miles isn't unheard
of. Just a week before, Kenenisa Bekele, winner of the 5,000 and 10,000 meters
at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, won his first marathon in Paris. Also, 18-year-
old Tsegaye Mekonnen, who finished fifth here, celebrated his marathon debut
in January with victory in Dubai.

But it was quickly apparent that Farah wouldn't be a factor on Sunday. By the
halfway mark, he already was more than 40 seconds off the pace he'd hoped for.
Now the question for Farah, 31, is whether he will continue the marathon
experiment or revert back to the track with two years left before the 2016
Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.

The attention surrounding Farah eclipsed a more successful transition from the
track to the marathon in the women's race. Dibaba, like Farah, took gold in
the 10,000 meters in London two years ago and finished her first marathon in a
strong 2:20:35. Her shot at the top two evaporated when she dropped her water
bottle and paused to pick it up.

"I was feeling pretty good," she said, "but it's difficult to lose so much
time against top athletes."

Ahead of her, the two Kiplagats spent the latter stages of the race shoulder-
to-shoulder. They passed Big Ben still level, waiting to make a decisive move.
That came 200 meters from the finish, when Edna Kiplagat, the double world
champion, pulled away. Florence Kiplagat couldn't follow.

The result completed a steady progression for Edna Kiplagat who was third here
three years ago and twice the runner-up in the past two years.

Road racing is difficult in the UK. The roadways tend to be hard: little give;
knees and hips take the shock. Shin splints are common.

Poor Mo. At least he tried out his new goal/objective. Better luck next time
if he still decides to carry on running marathons.

I guess there's more money for runners in marathons, but except for that, it
would make more sense to stick with the events where you're at the top.
