LONDON—Euro-zone industrial output rose steadily in January as growth in France helped offset weakness in Germany and Italy, and initial estimates of a drop in December were revised to show a modest increase, official data showed Monday. 

Industrial output rose 0.3% from December and was 6.6% stronger than in January last year, the European Union's Eurostat agency said. In December, output grew 0.3% from the previous month and 8.8% from a year earlier despite severe winter weather—up from a preliminary estimate of a 0.1% drop in month-to-month and 8% gain year-to-year. 

"While the current rise in oil prices might impact [on] activity in the coming months, it looks all but sure that the first quarter will rake in a strong [gross domestic product] growth figure, probably around 0.7% quarter-on-quarter,"  Peter Vanden Houte, an economist at ING, said in a note. 

The January figures were slightly weaker than the market consensus estimate of increases of 0.4% month-to-month and 6.4% on the year. There are 17 members states in the euro zone after Estonia joined at the start of the year. 

On a monthly basis, output growth in France picked up to 1.1% in January from 0.2% in December, but in Germany it slowed to 0.1% from 1% and in Italy output dropped 1.5% following a 0.2% increase in December. 

On a monthly basis, output growth in France picked up to 1.1% in January from 0.2% in December, but in Germany it slowed to 0.1% from 1% and in Italy output dropped 1.5% following a 0.2% increase in December. 

There was a mixed performance by euro-zone member states at the heart of the currency area's debt crisis—with Spain registering a 1.4% jump in industrial output in January following a drop in December, while output in Ireland fell 1% and production in Portugal slumped 4.2%. 

The Eurostat data suggested December's winter weather continued to distort the industry figures in January, with big swings in production of energy, and output of intermediate and durable consumer goods. 

Energy output fell 3.1%, the sharpest monthly drop since March 2009, following a 2.5% increase in December when Germany and some other countries suffered a severe cold snap. 

By contrast, production of intermediate goods, such as steel, jumped 2.5% in January, the strongest monthly increase for 11 years, following a 1.2% drop in December. Production of durable consumer goods also gained 2.5%, the sharpest rise since last May, following a 0.6% drop in December. 

More up-to-date surveys of purchasing managers in the euro zone's manufacturing sector by Markit suggest the sector grew at the strongest pace for nearly 11 years in February, driven by a record expansion in Germany, although inflation is accelerating in tandem. 

The financial information company has said its surveys of both the manufacturing and the services sector suggest the euro-zone economy is growing at a quarterly rate of about 8% in the first quarter following a 0.3% expansion in the final quarter of last year.
