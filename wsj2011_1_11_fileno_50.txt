Finding a home wasn't on the itinerary of Michael and Sarah Jefferson's getaway weekend to Woodstock, N.Y. 

"We saw a for sale sign and on a whim, decided to drive in and take a look," said Ms. Jefferson, who works in philanthropy. "It was as if we had stumbled on Sleeping Beauty's castle."



The couple had discovered what struck them as a special property in the town of Hurley, N.Y., spread across some 12 acres with views of mountains and the Ashokan Reservoir. But they knew that restoring the European-style stone-and-copper estate on the site to its original glory was going to take significant work. 

"It was in a state of neglect," said Ms. Jefferson of the home, which the couple purchased along with an adjacent parcel in 2004 for $1.47 million, according to property records. "It was surrounded by brambles and weeds that were six-feet high."

The couple said they spent the next four years restoring the 21-room mansion, keeping many of the estate's original details while upgrading the finishes. Spanning some 12,000 square feet, the three-level home has a large ballroom, three kitchens and a grand dining room with coffered ceilings and two fireplaces. The carriage house was restored with dark woods and the bathhouse was converted into a gym.

The couple are selling the estate because Mr. Jefferson, who works as a physician and health-care administrator, has taken a job on the Australian island of Tasmania. The home has been on and off the market since 2008, said listing agent Norm Mackay of Houlihan Lawrence. The price has dropped 13.5%, from $5.2 million to its current $4.5 million.
