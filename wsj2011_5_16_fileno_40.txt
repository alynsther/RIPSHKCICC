MUMBAI â€“ Prices in India are unlikely to see a steep fall, a deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India said Monday, noting that the risk of commodity price inflation becoming generalized is now visible. 

Subir Gokarn said even though India's economic growth rate is reassuring, the slowdown in investment activity is not desirable. 

India's inflation decelerated slightly to 8.66% in April from 9.04% in the previous month but remains above the RBI's comfort zone.
