_Here is [Predicteform](http://www.predicteform.com/)'s in-depth analysis of
Sunday's Woodbine Mile from Woodbine Racetrack, including Pace Figures and
Form Cycle Patterns of each starter. Please refer to the
[Legend](http://predicteform.com/Legend) or [Pattern
Guide](http://predicteform.com/Pattern-Guide) for back-up definitions and
patterns._

_The Grade 1, $1 million Ricoh Woodbine Mile is run at 1 mile (8 furlongs) on
the turf. The race goes to post at 6:13 p.m. ET (Fox Sports 1). This race is
part of the [Breeders' Cup Challenge Series](http://www.breederscup.com/races
/breeders-cup-challenge). _

about the value of winning a Breeders' Cup Challenge Race. Two-time reigning
Horse of the Year Wise Dan won both the Woodbine Mile and the Breeders' Cup
Mile in 2012 and 2013._

Figures/Woodbine-09-14-2014-Race11) and [Past
Performances](http://www.predicteform.com/Media/WoodbineMile14.pdf) in
addition to the race analysis._

** __#1: River Seven (20-1)**

One of two Canadian breds, River Seven has one win against Grade 3 company but
has yet to break through against the top runners in the division.

His Pace Figures are on a decline, though his last effort at 10 furlongs
should be overlooked as it was a PLOW Form Cycle Pattern--when the pace of the
race is very slow and therefore pushes the final figure down. Removing that
68.9 from the set, he still looks a couple points lighter than the field.

_The Play: Too Slow—his last race notwithstanding, the final figures aren't
competitive against these._

**#2: Trade Storm (6-1)**

The only European shipper in the field, Trade Storm showed some back class by
finishing third in this race last year. His 2014 European racing season on
paper looks up and down, as he has been competitive at the Group 2 and 3
levels but not so much in Group I company.

His race on March 8 in the Group I Jebel Hatta was interesting. He was third
to last most of the way in a race that was slowly run up front. He rallied
wide and made up lengths against a field where no one else was moving forward.
He had a poor showing in the $5 million Dubai Duty Free at 9 furlongs followed
by two good efforts in the U.K. in Group 3 races. Jaime Spencer, his regular
jockey, comes in to ride, which is a positive as Spencer has had success
riding graded-stakes winners in North America. (Side Glance finished third in
the Arlington Million).

_The Play: Fringe Contender—competitive last year in this race, he is on
another good line as the only Euro shipper, and at 6-1 on the morning line he
has value._

**#3: Ancil (30-1)**

With two eighth-place finishes and a 12th place finish in his three Grade 3
races, Ancil looks to be up against it in Grade 1 company. Looking at his Pace
Figures, he's competed in sprints his last 12 races and has put up high four-
furlong figures in most of those races. A sprinter going long in this case is
likely to go strong to the lead which could intensify an early pace.

_The Play—Too Slow: Though he could challenge (or get the lead) early, his
lack of depth going long means he will be finished early._

**#4: Sliver Freak (20-1)**

The lightest-raced horse in the field, the 5-year-old Silver Freak has only
eight starts lifetime. His debut race was only a year ago, an oddity for a
Grade 1 stakes competitor. He has yet to run in graded-stakes company, however
he did run third in May against Lockout (No. 7), who has proved himself as a
graded-stakes competitor. "Freak" picks up jockey John Velazquez (one of the
top jocks in North America, especially on front runners) as Joel Rosario moves
to Bobby's Kitten.

Looking at his Pace Figures, he has the highest last race final figure in the
race of 82.3, while managing his energy efficiently as shown by the 74.9 four
furlong figure (also note the race was at 8 furlongs). His prior two efforts
in 2014 were both in the very high 70s, again with consistent 4f figures.

_The Play: Not Quite--The fastest last Final Pace Figure is worth something,
though this field is laden with speed. It's a tough bet to make that he can
rate and repeat his last effort._

**#5: Kaigun (5-2)**

A hard-trying Grade 2 winner and Grade 1 competitor trained by Mark Casse,
Kaigun's last five starts have been at five different tracks and five
different distances. Leading Woodbine jockey  Patrick Husbands gave him a
perfect ride in winning the Grade 2 Play the King Stakes, sitting well off a
furious speed duel on Aug. 10. He ran well against Wise Dan on two occasions
this year and is 2 for 2 at Woodbine lifetime.

Looking at his Pace Figures, he ran a lifetime top of 78 last start with an
inflated 74.2 4f figure (as the lead horses went very fast up front). His Pace
Figures in his six 2014 starts are all between 74.8—77.2 with 4f figures
between 53.7 and 66.7.

_The Play: Too Slow—Lifetime top combined with a consistent final and 4f
figure that look to be a bit slow make him an underlay with no value as the
5-2 morning-line favorite._

**#6: Dorsett (15-1)**

Another runner who has tested graded-stakes level competition with little
luck, Dorsett has a couple of fourth-place finishes most recently against
quality Grade 2 runners. Dating back to July 2013, he's got starts at seven
different race tracks all between the 8f and 9f distance. He's also had seven
different jockeys over that same period. He also had a trainer switch two
starts ago and picks up a top Canadian jockey in Luis Contreras.

Turning to his Pace Figures, his most recent effort was an 80.2 at Saratoga.
Preceding that race he ran at 44.3 PLOW (which you can "draw a line through"),
followed by a 67.6, 75.8, a big move over three races.

_The Play: Regressor—Lifetime top combined with a three race forward progress
pattern indicates regression._

**#7: Lockout (10-1)**

Another horse in the field trained by Mark Casse, Lockout exits the same race
as Kaigun on Aug. 10. Visually speaking, his effort was more impressive. He
was dead last and came six-wide down the stretch (vs. Kaigun--who rallied up
the rail). He stretches out from 7f to 8f and retails journeyman jockey Gary
Boulanger, who will likely have him in a similar position early in the race.

Looking at his Pace Figures, they are more impactful than his past
performances. His most recent four Final Pace Figures have been
80.5—77.5—77.5—77.4. His 4f figure spiked at 80.6 but settled last race at
70.9, indicating a runner who is doing a better job of managing his energy.

_The Play: Longshot—while he is unlikely to be forwardly placed and close to
the lead, and has one of the lesser-known jocks in the race, his Pace Figures
say he could compete as this level with his best effort._

**#8: Bobby's Kitten (15-1)**

The only 3-year-old in the field, Bobby's Kitten ships in to Woodbine for U.S.
leading owner Ken Ramsey and turf specialist trainer Chad Brown. He raced four
times as a 2-year-old, including the Breeders' Cup Juvenile and now five times
this season. Jockey Javier Castellano opts off Bobby's Kitten and Joel Rosario
climbs aboard. Rosario might actually be a better fit for this front-runner as
he is one of the strongest riders on the front end. All of Bobby's Kitten's
wins except one have been wire-to-wire, which points to him doing his best
running on the lead.

His Pace Figure line is as interesting as it is confusing. His top figure last
year was a 79, a very big number as a juvenile. He looked to be slowly finding
his "sea-legs" at 3 by testing (with little success) the graded-stakes level
until his most recent effort at Saratoga where he ran an 80.7. Normally a
10-point jump (from 70.9—80.7) could be seen as a big top, though his 2-year-
old race figure of 79 makes it seem more likely.

_The Play: Regressor—Rating is better than he has done in his lifetime, but
hasn't been able at this Grade 1 level of competition._

**#9: Jack Milton (7-2)**

Trained by Todd Pletcher, the No. 1 trainer in North America, Jack Milton has
been on a horse player's wish list in every start. He is 12: 4-1-5 lifetime
and has never had greater odds than 4.5-1. He has been placed selectively and
properly in each start. He has finished third in two Grade 1 races and is a
two-time winner in Grade 3 races. North America's leading jockey Javier
Castellano stays on board.

Visually speaking, his last effort was just OK. Castellano was on the whip
most of the stretch and while he didn't have a lot of running room, it looked
more like he was hanging. He is on a good Form Cycle Pattern moving from
77.9—79.9—79.1—81.2 most recent while his 4f and 6f figures are consistent.

_The Play: Fringe Contender—There is much to like here with the exception of
that last race visually. At odds above 4-1, there is value._

**#10: His Race to Win (15-1)**

A multiple Grade 3 winner on the all-weather surface at Woodbine, His Race to
Win gets back on turf where he is just one for six lifetime.

His Final Pace Figures are in the high 70s (on the all-weather), however his
two starts on turf are just 76 and 60.

_The Play: Too Slow—Lesser Pace Figures and an indication that turf isn't his
preferred surface are tough obstacles to overcome._

**#11: Grand Arch (4-1)**

With three wins, a second and two thirds in six starts on the Woodbine turf,
Grand Arch has the home-track advantage. While the outside post is a negative,
he has enough go to not need to rally from last. Visually speaking, his last
race was impressive. He was beaten by Seek Again, who was full of run in his
last putting up an 82 final figure.

His last three sets of pace figures are 81.2/75.8—79.4/68.5 - 74.8/59.6 show
increases in both 4f and Final Figure while still maintaining a six-point turf
spread (difference between final and 4f figure). The 80.5 in June of last year
solidifies the 81.2 as a reasonable final figure.

_The Play: Contender—Pace Figures, track success and Form Cycle Pattern all
point to another forward move._
