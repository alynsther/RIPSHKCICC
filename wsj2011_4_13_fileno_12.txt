Standard & Poor's Ratings Services said it is reviewing Iceland for a possible downgrade after the country's citizens rejected a government-negotiated deal related to Icesave, the collapsed Internet bank. 

Over the weekend, Icelanders voted down a deal that would have repaid Britain and the Netherlands around â‚¬4 billion ($5.8 billion), including interest, in return for the two governments having compensated Icesave depositors in their countries after its operator, Landsbanki Islands, collapsed in October 2008 along with the rest of Iceland's big banks. 

The proposal went to a referendum after Iceland's president, Olafur Grimsson, issued a veto. The matter may now have to be settled in a European Free Trade Association court. 

"The prolonged dispute over the Icesave issue could weaken Iceland's relationship with other European countries, increase its external financing risks, and hinder Iceland's economic prospects as well as delay the lifting of capital controls and its return to international capital markets," the ratings company said Wednesday. 

S&P said it expects the dispute to return to the EFTA court, where a ruling could take a year or longer. S&P has Iceland's foreign-currency credit rating at triple-B-minus, just above junk territory, and its local-currency rating one step higher at triple B.
