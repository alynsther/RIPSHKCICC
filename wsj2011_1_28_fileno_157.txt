ISTANBUL—Turkey's trade deficit widened more than expected in December as imports grew twice as fast as exports, reaffirming concerns that the rapidly growing economy is overheating and adding pressure on policy makers to slow growth. 

According to Turkey's Statistics Institute Friday, the foreign trade deficit widened 78% in December to $8.7 billion from $4.9 billion a year earlier, topping analysts expectations and pushing the full-year gap to $71.6 billion. 

Economists said the numbers reinforced the view that the broader current-account deficit, which has widened rapidly since Turkey rebounded from recession, is the fast-growing economy's Achilles heel. 

"The number is slightly wide as export growth is running half that of imports ... reaffirming concerns that the economy is overheating and will add further pressure on policy makers to work to slow the economy down; difficult this side of parliamentary elections," said  Timothy Ash, emerging markets economist at Royal Bank of Scotland in London. 

Turkey's broader current-account deficit more than trebled in November to hit a record $5.933 billion, spotlighting a persistent weakness in the economy at a time of rapid growth and signaling a mounting problem for policy makers this year. 

The rapid widening of Turkey's current-account deficit is in one sense symptomatic of Turkey's strong rebound from recession, as the economy is unusually dependent on imports and domestic demand. 

But the scale of the widening current-account deficit—and particularly the speculative assets that are financing it—has unnerved some investors and Turkish policy makers, while ratings agencies regularly cite the imbalance as a reason for keeping fast-growing and fiscally disciplined Turkey below investment grade.
