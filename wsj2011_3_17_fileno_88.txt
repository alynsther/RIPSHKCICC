Good Beer is the latest craft beer shop in the city where patrons can pick up a six-pack from an obscure Long Island brewery and also sample some brews on tap. 

At Good Beer, a craft beer shop in the East Village, patrons can pick up a six-pack or sample a selection of rotating brews on tap.

The store sells more than 600 different types of canned and bottled beers, which are available to go only. But it also has rotating selection of a dozen beers on tap that can be sipped in the store. 

The brightly-lit store lacks the ambiance of a bar, but the customers are there for the beer. There are a few tables where customers can grab a seat. When those are taken during the late-evening rush, customers line the aisles with their pints in hand. 

Hungry beer fans can also get hot dogs or a meat and cheese plate to go. 

Tastings of four beers are available for $8 and pints are $6. Recently, the store served a double-black IPA called Yakima Glory from Victory Brewing, a dark beer with a balanced malty and hoppy taste. They also served a scotch ale called Backwoods Bastard from Founders Brewing Co. that tastes a bit like bourbon and finishes with a caramel taste.

 Good Beer, 422 E. Ninth St. near First Avenue, opens Monday through Saturday at 11 a.m and at noon Sunday; (212) 677-4836.
