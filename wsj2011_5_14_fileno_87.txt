A growing number of European Tour pros are clamoring to create a new logo honoring the much-beloved Seve Ballesteros, who died of cancer May 7. A mockup of his iconic salute, above, is from Golfweek magazine. The current logo, left, features Harry Vardon, who won six British Opens between 1896 and 1914.

Mark Wilson penalized himself for a double-hit on Friday at the Players Championship, despite an inconclusive video review. If he makes the cut (he was right on the number with a few holes to play), watch out. Similarly on the cut line in the second round at the 2007 Honda Classic, Wilson called a penalty on himself when his caddy gave advice to another player. Wilson made the cut and wound up winning the event in a four-man playoff.
