 said Saturday it is working out "fair compensation" for the customers affected by a scandal at its banking branch in the northern Indian town of Gurgaon. 

"We have been reconciling amounts involved with impacted customers...this process [of working out compensation] will happen over a period of time," the bank said in a statement. 

It added that it will continue to support the investigating authorities fully until the matter is resolved. 

Citi didn't provide financial details in the statement. 

Police in Gurgaon are investigating a case in which an employee at the Citibank branch allegedly colluded with others to siphon off an estimated $67.2 million from wealth-management customers. The alleged scam included making false promises on investment returns and forging government documents. 

The police arrested the relationship manager,  Shivraj Puri, last month and on Jan. 2 arrested an executive at New Delhi-based Hero Group, a conglomerate that is a large stakeholder in India's biggest motorcycle maker. The Hero executive allegedly received commissions for helping direct money from his firm into the plot. 

Mr. Puri has made no public statement since his arrest. His lawyer couldn't immediately be reached Saturday.

On Jan. 5, Hero Group said it put two other employees on leave while it investigates whether they were involved.
