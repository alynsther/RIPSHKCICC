MUMBAI â€“ Adani Power Ltd. Monday reported a 77% rise in net profit for the fiscal fourth-quarter through March, helped by electricity generation capacity added during the year. 

Net profit for January-March rose to 1.74 billion rupees ($38.9 million) from 983.2 million rupees a year earlier. 

Sales rose to 8.56 billion rupees from 2.01 billion rupees.

The net profit figure missed expectations. The average of estimates in a poll of 11 analysts was for net profit of 2.26 billion rupees on net sales of 7.91 billion rupees. 

Adani Power, a unit of diversified conglomerate Adani group, said total expenses rose to 4.14 billion rupees from 1.02 billion rupees. Fuel costs, which formed the bulk of the expenses, rose to 2.58 billion rupees from 697.4 million rupees a year earlier. 

The power producer incurred interest costs of 962.0 million rupees during the quarter, compared with interest income of 48.4 million rupees a year earlier. 

"Adani Power is currently implementing 16,500 megawatts of power generation projects across seven locations in India. With such a robust financial performance, we are confident of meeting our target of generating 20,000 MW by 2020," the company's chairman  Gautam Adani said in a statement. 

The company, which had a generation capacity of 1,980 MW as of March 31, said the rate of electricity sold under power purchase agreements was 2.88 rupees per kilowatt hour during the quarter and 2.79 rupees per kWh for the year. 

The average realization rate on the sale of electricity was at 3.09 rupees per kWh for the full year, Mr. Adani said in a statement. 

Adani Power is implementing a 4,620 MW project in Mundra in the western state of Gujarat--which will be expanded by 3,300 MW--a 3,300 MW project in Tiroda in Maharashtra state, a 1,320 MW project in Kawai in Rajasthan state and a 2,640 MW project in Dahej in Gujarat. 

"We expect to add 2,640 MW at Mundra and 1,320 MW, or at least 660 MW, at Tiroda this [financial] year," Adani Power Chief Financial Officer Prabal Banerji said. "That's about 4,000 MW and if we add that to our existing capacity, we will have about 6,000 MW running at the end of 2011-12." 

Mr. Banerji said the company is getting imported coal from its own mines and existing supply will be sufficient to cover 85%-95% of Adani Power's overall coal requirements. 

The remaining should be met from coal sourced from the mines given to it in India for exclusive usage, he said. But, in case this doesn't materialize, Adani Power will import coal or purchase it from Coal India Ltd. at a price higher than what it currently pays, Mr. Banerji said. 

He said Adani Power doesn't expect to face problems from state distribution utilities drawing less-than-expected electricity as demand for power is growing and state electricity boards are raising tariffs.
