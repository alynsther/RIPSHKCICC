NEW DELHI â€“ An Indian court Thursday extended the judicial custody of former telecommunications minister Andimuthu Raja, two of his former aides and a corporate executive until March 31 in a case relating to irregularities in allotting telecom licenses and bandwidth in 2008. 

Apart from Mr. Raja, the court also extended the judicial custody of former telecom secretary Siddartha Behura, Mr. Raja's former personal secretary R.K. Chandolia, as well as  Shahid Balwa, vice chairman of Etisalat DB Telecom Pvt. Ltd. 

"The investigation is in progress and is at a crucial stage in which more witnesses are yet to be examined and some more documents are to be collected," the Central Bureau of Investigation said in its application seeking extension of Mr. Raja's custody. 

The CBI has been scrutinizing alleged irregularities in the government's 2008 sale of mobile phone licenses and bandwidth, which includes selling the bandwidth at 2001 prices as well as advancing the cut off date for license applications to favor a few companies. It arrested the four in February in connection with the probe. All four have denied any wrongdoing. 

The investigative agency estimates the government lost about $4.88 billion of potential revenue due to the irregularities. A report by a federal auditor estimates the potential losses at close to $40 billion. 

The CBI has named Swan Telecom Pvt. Ltd., which was later renamed Etisalat DB, among the beneficiaries of the allegedly rigged license sale. Mr. Balwa is a co-founder of Swan, and also of real-estate company DB Realty Ltd.
