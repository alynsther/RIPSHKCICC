Two former part-time employees of the Jets filed a lawsuit in New York Supreme Court on Monday alleging that their complaints about sexually suggestive text messages from former quarterback Brett Favre cost them their jobs with the team.

Christina Scavo and Shannon O'Toole, who worked as massage therapists at the Jets' training camp in 2008, are suing Mr. Favre, the Jets and Lisa Ripi, a woman who hires massage therapists for the team, according to the lawsuit. A Jets spokesman declined to comment, citing a "pending legal matter." An attorney representing Ms. Scavo and Ms. O'Toole didn't return an email seeking comment. Mr. Favre's agent, Bus Cook, couldn't be reached for comment.

The lawsuit alleges that Mr. Favre sent text messages to an unidentified massage therapist and suggested that he, the unidentified therapist and Ms. Scavo "get together." After Ms. Scavo's husband confronted Mr. Favre and told him to stop, Ms. Scavo and Ms. O'Toole were no longer offered work by the Jets, according to the lawsuit.

The suit comes less than a week after the NFL fined Mr. Favre $50,000 for what it said was his failure to cooperate in an investigation about lewd text messages and photos that he allegedly sent to a Jets game-day host, Jenn Sterger, also in 2008.
