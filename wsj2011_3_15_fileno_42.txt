India's Essar group expects to start production at its newly acquired Zimbabwe Iron and Steel Co.'s one million metric ton steel plant over the next 12 months. However, the company needs to finalize its total investment in that country and finalize deal terms before it can turn on the lights at the manufacturing facility.

"There are certain pre-conditions for production to begin in that plant," Malay Mukherjee, CEO of Essar Steel, told Dow Jones Newswires. "A team from Essar Steel is currently in Zimbabwe talking to the government, " he said.

Essar Africa Holdings Ltd., a subsidiary of the Essar group, and the Zimbabwe government last week signed an agreement to set up two joint-venture companies that will acquire all the steel and mining assets and liabilities of Zimbabwe Iron and Steel, which has been defunct for the past few years.

Essar will own 60% of the steel joint venture and 80% of the mining company, while the Zimbabwe government will hold the rest.

Mr. Mukherjee said Essar Steel also will explore for iron-ore mines in Zimbabwe over the next several months.

"We will decide on the quantum of investment in Zimbabwe once we get a clearer picture," he added.

Zimbabwe Iron and Steel, or ZISCO ran out of money and has been non-operational for the past few years. The manufacturing unit suffers from poor maintenance of plant and equipment, irregular supply of power and other critical raw materials.
