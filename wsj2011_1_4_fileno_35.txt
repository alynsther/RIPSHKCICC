's sales in China rose 29% last year to a record 2.35 million vehicles, making GM the first foreign auto maker to surpass the two-million-unit mark for annual sales in the country, the Detroit-based company said.

Meanwhile,  Toyota Motor Corp. said its Chinese sales increased 19% to 846,000 vehicles for the year, beating the company's target of 800,000 units. December sales in China rose 34% from a year earlier. 

Despite the strength, both companies' gains were slower than the overall growth rate for China's domestic auto market. The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said domestic auto makers likely sold a total of 18 million vehicles last year, up 32%. And GM's increase was slower than the 67% gain it recorded for 2009. 

Sales growth is expected to slow this year this year as government incentives dry up and environmental regulations take hold. Toyota set a target of selling 900,000 cars in China next year, which would be roughly a 6% increase.

GM's sales last year came as the auto maker introduced 11 new or upgraded models in China, which is now GM's largest market. Sales of Chevrolet, one of GM's best-selling brands in China, increased 63% to 543,709 vehicles. 

"Over the next 12 months, GM will continue to grow its presence in China through the introduction of cutting-edge products like the Chevrolet Volt and the start of sale of the Baojun passenger car brand,"  Kevin Wale, president and managing director of GM China Group, said in a prepared statement Tuesday. He said GM will continue to increase its manufacturing capacity in China.

, sold 1.03 million units last year, up 42%, to become China's first passenger-car maker with annual sales of more than a million units, GM said. SAIC-GM-Wuling Automobile Co., GM's commercial minivehicle joint venture with SAIC Motor and Wuling Automobile Co., sold 1.23 million vehicles last year, up 16% and accounting for about 40% of that market in China, GM said. 

The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers predicted sales growth in China would slow to 10% this year because the government has withdrawn some incentive programs and local governments are likely to introduce measures to ease congestion. The purchase tax for passenger cars with engines of 1.6 liters or smaller rose this year to 10% from 7.5%. 

To combat congestion, Beijing's city government said it will issue a maximum of 240,000 license plates for new cars and microvans this year, about a third of the 750,000 expected for last year. The city said it will restrict new licenses to registered Beijing residents and that cars without Beijing plates will be barred from entering the main city area during rush hour. Other major cities are expected to follow Beijing's lead. 

Separately, GM said its sales in India, another major emerging market beyond GM's traditional strongholds of North America and Europe, rose 59% to 110,804 vehicles.
