Olympique Marseille will attempt to make history when it travels to Manchester United in the Champions League's round of 16 on Tuesday night.

United has never lost a European game at home to a French team in 11 previous matches and, following a goalless draw in the first match of the two-leg tie in Marseille, oddsmakers have the Premier League team as heavy favorite to extend that sequence here.

United is odds on at 6/17 with Bwin to progress to the quarterfinals for a fifth straight year, while Marseille is an 11/4 underdog to advance.

Marseille last travelled to Old Trafford in September 1999 when United recorded a 2-1 victory. Paul Scholes got the winner back thenâ€”one of 24 goals in 118 Champions League appearances for the midfielder. Now 36 years old, Scholes is likely to return to the starting lineup for this game, in which he is 5/1 to score at any time.

United is unbeaten at home this season, having prevailed in 18 of its 21 matches in all competitions, and is available at 1/2 to secure a 19th home win. The club is also undefeated in the Champions League so far, but just one of its seven games has been decided by more than one goal, so backing United to win 1-0 at 11/2 with Blue Square and 888sport is advised.

Elsewhere, Bayern Munich defends a one-goal lead at home to Italy's Inter Milan on Tuesday. A last-minute goal by Mario Gomez in San Siro a fortnight ago means the Germans holds the edge here and can be backed at 2/9 to advance to the quarterfinals.
