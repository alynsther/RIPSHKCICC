The Big Ten is preparing to add men's ice hockey as an official sport in 2013, a move that would reshape the sport. The six-team Big Ten would have several of the biggest schools in the sport—Michigan, Michigan State, Ohio State, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Penn State—but in the process, existing leagues would lose their highest-profile teams. The Big Ten said its teams will work with those leagues to maintain attractive schedules.

One year after leading Tennessee to arguably the highest point in its basketball history, Bruce Pearl is reportedly out as the Volunteers coach. In 2010, Tennessee reached the Elite Eight for the first time ever, but Pearl's job has been in peril since last fall when he admitted to lying to the NCAA during an investigation of his program. Tennessee did not return messages seeking comment.
