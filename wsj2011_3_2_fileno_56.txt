One of the most widespread complaints from casual baseball fans centers around the game's often sleep-inducing pace. College baseball, though, may have just solved the problem. 

How new clock rules in college baseball have affected the duration of games over the season's first 10 days

Ten days into the 2011 college season, new rules designed to speed up play appear to be working—shaving more than 15 minutes off of the average game time. The new regulations, enacted last summer by the NCAA Baseball Rules Committee, limit time between innings and pitches. Breaks between innings are capped at 90 seconds, extended to 108 seconds for televised games. Time between pitches may not exceed 20 seconds, except if runners are on base, when there is no limit. The first time a pitcher violates the rule, he is given a warning. For each subsequent violation, an automatic ball is called. When the batting team is not ready after the allotted time, an automatic strike is called. (The SEC, which piloted the scheme during last year's conference tournament, uses a scoreboard clock, while other conferences use umpires' stopwatches.)

Over the first several hundred games of the D-I season, about 76% of contests this year have been completed in three hours or less, compared to 57% during the same span last year. The improvement is more dramatic at the 2:30 threshold: One-third of games this season have been completed in that amount of time, compared to only 14% in 2010.

Pace of game is particularly important in college baseball, due to the frequency of doubleheaders and the Sunday evening curfews in many conferences. What's more, in tournament play, as many as four games per day are scheduled on a single field. With this problem potentially fixed, all that's left to do now is to convince Major League Baseball to adopt the same rules.
