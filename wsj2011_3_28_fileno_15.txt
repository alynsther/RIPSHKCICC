MUMBAI â€“Indian shares extended their positive streak to a fifth session Monday, boosted by gains in auto and banking shares. 

The Bombay Stock Exchange's Sensitive Index rose 127.50 points, or 0.7%, to close at 18,943.14. The benchmark has gained 6.2% over the past five sessions. 

Trading volume on the BSE dropped to 31.97 billion rupees ($691 million) from Friday's 32.90 billion rupees. Gainers lagged decliners 1,239 to 1,714, while 100 stocks were unchanged. 

On the National Stock Exchange, the 50-stock S&P CNX Nifty gained 33.00 points, or 0.6%, to end at 5,687.25. 

"Last week's rally further strengthened today, but we expect the market to consolidate around current levels after five consecutive sessions of gains and ahead of the expiry of March derivatives Thursday," said  Avinash Gupta, vice president at Bonanza Portfolio Ltd. "There are no positive triggers at the macro level to drive the market sharply higher." 

Mid-cap and small-cap shares, which have been absent from the recent market rally, are likely to see greater buying interest only when investors are convinced the market will hold its gains, say analysts. 

Out of the 30 Sensex constituents, 20 ended higher Monday. 

Auto shares rose ahead of March vehicle sales numbers, due Friday, on expectations auto makers have maintained the pace of their sales growth.  Tata Motors rose 3.3% to 1,220.30 rupees and Maruti Suzuki gained 1.7% to 1,201.80 rupees, while Bajaj Auto closed 1.4% up at 1,339.30 rupees. 

Banks continued their good run with the bank sub-index posting gains for the sixth consecutive session.  HDFC Bank rose 1.3% to 2,291.30 rupees, while State Bank of India, the country's largest lender, closed 1.4% higher at 2,747.30 rupees. 

Bharti Airtel rose 2.6% to 347.80 rupees after Dow Jones Newswires reported the company is close to signing an agreement to share third-generation radio bandwidth with Idea Cellular and Vodafone Essar. Idea Cellular, which isn't a part of the Sensex, gained 2.4% to 65.45 rupees. 

Larsen & Toubro, which has a 5.8% weight in the Sensex, led gains among infrastructure firms on a bullish demand outlook, closing 2.6% higher at 1,693.20 rupees. 

Among decliners,  Infosys Technologies fell 0.7% to 3,139.55 rupees on profit-taking after having gained 5.3% in the previous session. 

Jaiprakash Associates fell 2.2% to 88.40 rupees, while Reliance Communications closed 1.5% lower at 105.20 rupees.
