The food division, San Miguel Pure Foods Co., contributed 80.4 billion pesos to revenue, up 4%, while San Miguel Brewery added 55.8 billion pesos, up 9%. 

San Miguel Brewery's domestic sales volume rose 5% to 184 million cases, while the unit's operating income increased 17% to 18.8 billion pesos amid the higher sales volume and favorable raw-material prices.
