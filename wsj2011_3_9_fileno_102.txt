A million dead sardines carpeting a Southern California harbor raised quite a stink Tuesday morning, spurring cries that the end of days—or at least environmental disaster—was at hand.

Instead, state and local officials said, the Redondo Beach fish kill—the largest in California that officials could recall—appeared to be a fluke natural occurrence. 

"It looks like Armageddon, but it really isn't. It's a sad, unfortunate event," said Andrew Hughan, spokesman for the California Department of Fish and Game, who surveyed the scene from a boat.

He said scientists from his agency and others tested waters for oil or chemicals and discovered nothing unusual. There also wasn't any visual evidence of "red tide," an accumulation of algae that cuts off oxygen—a big one hit Redondo Beach five years ago—though scientists were conducting more tests.

Mr. Hughan and Redondo Beach police spokesman Phil Keenan said experts theorized that fierce winds Monday night may have driven the sardines into the harbor in search of safety from the roaring ocean. The fish then may have swum to the northern corner of the harbor at the Kings Harbor Marina in search of an exit; so many fish in a small space could have depleted oxygen and killed them, according to these officials.

"They're not extremely smart," said Brent Scheiwe, a marine biologist who directs the SEA Lab, a marine conservation and education program of the Los Angeles Conservation Corp that is based in the Redondo Beach harbor. Mr. Scheiwe conducted early tests of the fish Tuesday morning. "They don't have a map and they don't know the way out, so they go deeper into the harbor and get less circulation." 

By late Tuesday morning, as the smell of dead fish grew more pungent, crews of firefighters, volunteer fishermen and others raced to scoop them out of the water with nets and put them in large Dumpsters. From there, they were headed to a landfill.
