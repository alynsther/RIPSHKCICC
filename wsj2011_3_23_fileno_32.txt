MUMBAI â€“Indian shares closed higher in heavy trade Wednesday because of bargain buying in select stocks and led by gains in heavyweight ICICI Bank. 

The Bombay Stock Exchange's Sensitive Index rose 217.86 points ($942 million), or 1.2%, to finish at 18,206.16. On the National Stock Exchange, the 50-stock S&P CNX Nifty gained 66.40 points, or 1.2%, to end at 5,480.25. 

Trading volume on the BSE jumped to 42.30 billion rupees from Tuesday's 29.43 billion rupees. Gainers outnumbered decliners 1,650 to 1,194, while 135 stocks were unchanged. 

"Sectors which had corrected sharply are rising on bits and pieces of good news," said  Sharmila Joshi, co-head of private client group sales at Emkay Global Financial Services. "There was buying interest in mid-caps as well." 

However, she expects the Sensex to face selling pressure at the 18,500-18,600 levels unless there are some major positive triggers. 

Of the 30 Sensex constituents, 26 ended higher Wednesday. 

ICICI Bank led gains in banking shares as traders built up long positions expecting strong January-March results, say analysts. ICICI Bank has trailed other large Indian banks over the past one year, but now appears to be well-positioned with strong profitability and growth pickup,  Morgan Stanley
