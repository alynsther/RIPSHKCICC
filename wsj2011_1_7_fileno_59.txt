Danny Briere and Scott Hartnell each scored a pair of goals to help the Flyers top the Devils on Thursday at the Wells Fargo Center.

Dainus Zubrus and David Clarkson scored for the Devils, who lost their third straight and have languished at or near the bottom of the NHL standings this season. 

Johan Hedberg stopped 16 of 20 shots in the loss. It was the second straight game that future hall of famer Martin Brodeur dressed as a backup.
