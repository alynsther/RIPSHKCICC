LIMAâ€”Peru's main port of Callao reopened as authorities decided sea conditions had improved. Other smaller Peruvian ports were also due to reopen, a port authority official said. 

Peru's ports closed Friday afternoon following a tsunami warning for countries on the Pacific Ocean in the wake of Japan's deadly earthquake. 

Peru's ports remained closed for most of Monday, despite the tsunami warning being lifted over the weekend, due to abnormal sea and tide conditions, officials said. 

Peru is a leading exporter of silver, copper and gold, as well as fishmeal, which is used as animal feed. 

Although Peru braced itself for bigger-than-normal waves on Friday evening, the effects were minimal. Wave heights were about 20 centimeters to 50 centimeters above normal and there was some minor flooding in flat coastal areas but no major damages.
