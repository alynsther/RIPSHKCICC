Railroads have played a crucial role in history: They have created empires, shaped populations, spurred a standardized time system and driven economies around the world. "Railway Maps of the World" by Mark Ovenden (Viking) includes some 500 images that cover two centuries of trains, including route guides, advertising, surveyor's maps and travel postersâ€”along with history and anecdotes. Here is a look at some images from the book. 

For much of the 1800s, local time was determined by longitude. The 1860s diagram at left calculates the time in various cities, with Washington, D.C., at its center. This was fine in the stagecoach era, but faster-moving trains required more precision (confusion over time resulted in a series of accidents). And so in the U.S., Greenwich Mean Time was adopted on Nov. 18, 1883.



In this 1896 illustration, the trajectory of the railway line is distorted to fit into the dog's backbone. It was not uncommon for mapmakers to use frivolous animal forms, in a bid to stand out from the competition. 

Political agendas can play into map designs. This 1988 East Berlin map of services squashes West Berlin and its train lines into invisibility.
