NEW YORKâ€”U.S. stocks kicked off May with slim losses, as the energy sector followed the price of oil lower and investors couldn't sustain a morning rally that followed the death of Osama bin Laden.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average snapped a four-day winning streak as it closed down 3.18 points, or 0.02%, at 12807.36. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index also snapped a four-day streak as it lost 2.39 points, or 0.18%, to close at 1361.22. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite ended an eight-day winning streak as it dropped 9.46, or 0.33%, to finish at 2864.08.

The market has tended to rise on the first trading session of the month as new investors dive into stocks, but Monday's action follows the best month of the year so far for stocks. 

Stocks retreated midsession after European Central Bank Vice President  Vitor Constancio said restructuring Greek debt isn't an option, renewing doubts over the euro zone's ability to manage its trouble spots. Traders said the normal inflow of new money into the stock market on the month's first trading session largely dried up as Mr. Constancio spoke. 

"After earnings season, people tend to focus on the bigger-picture issues, and they're often more worrisome,"  Karl Mills, president and chief investment officer at  Jurika Mills & Keifer, said. In both the U.S. and Europe, investors are watching public finances closely. "The current trajectory of public debt relative to revenues is alarming." 

Sunday night, U.S. stock futures had jumped and oil fell on word that Mr. bin Laden had been killed in a military operation announced by President Barack Obama. But the rally was short-lived. 

"The excitement about bin Laden kind of faded away,"  Len Blum, managing partner at Westwood Capital said. "We always expect a bigger reaction from current events than often happens, [but] they tend to be fleeting."
