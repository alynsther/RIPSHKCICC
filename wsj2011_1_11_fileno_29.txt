NEW DELHIâ€”  Research In Motion Ltd. Tuesday said it hasn't received any request from the Indian government or its agencies to filter Internet-accessed content on its BlackBerry smart phones. 

RIM's comments, in an email to Dow Jones Newswires, follow its announcement Monday that it would implement Internet content filtering in Indonesia "as soon as possible." 

That decision came after a minister threatened to shut down BlackBerry services if the Canadian company failed to block websites containing pornography. According to a RIM executive in Indonesia, it will be the first time the company applies Internet filtering in any country. 

RIM has come under pressure from the Indian government to provide access to data on its secure networks. India wants to monitor RIM's corporate email and messenger services, fearing BlackBerry's heavy encryption makes the services convenient for terrorists to use without being monitored. 

In a statement on Jan. 6, RIM said its ongoing talks with the Indian government for allowing monitoring of its BlackBerry services are "on track."
