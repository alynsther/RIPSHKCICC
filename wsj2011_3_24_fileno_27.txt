SEOULâ€”Scientists from North and South Korea will meet March 29 near the border between the two countries to discuss volcanic activity at Mt. Baektu, which lies at the far north of the peninsula, in a rare sign of cooperation that came amid military drills in the South. 

The meeting was confirmed Thursday by Seoul, and reflects both nations' heightened concerns about activity at the mountain following the devastating earthquake off the coast of Japan earlier this month.

Mt. Baektu, which straddles the border between North Korea and China, last erupted in 1903. While scientists say there are no signs of an imminent eruption, there have been increasing concerns over recent months that the mountain might erupt in the near future. 

The meeting plans were announced on the same day South Korea began military drills in Pocheon, 20 miles (about 30 kilometers) from the border, as a show of military strength ahead of the March 26 anniversary of last year's sinking of the Cheonan warship, which killed 46 sailors. The South blames the North for the sinking last year, a charge Pyongyang denies.

Relations between the rivals remain in a deep freeze. On March 17, South Korea rejected an offer from the North to discuss its nuclear program and return to six-party disarmament talks. South Korea insists the North needs to first show its peaceful intentions.

Nonetheless, North Korea sent a letter last week to South Korea's Meteorological Administration to suggest joint research on Mt. Baektu. 

"The great quake that hit Japan, in particular, underscores the urgency to conduct in a foresighted and successful manner research into earthquake and volcanic activities on the Korean Peninsula as it is geographically located close to that country," the letter said.

Five people from the North, including the vice-chief of North Korea's volcano-activity research institute, will attend the meeting, South Korea's Unification Ministry said.
