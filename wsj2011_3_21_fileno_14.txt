Mumbai -- PTC India Financial Services Ltd is likely to price its initial share offering at the top end of its indicative price band, between 26 and 28 rupees, despite relatively tepid demand for the offering, two people familiar with the matter said Monday. 

State-run power trading company PTC India Ltd financing arm is likely to sell the 133.2-million-share IPO at 28 rupees a piece, the people told Dow Jones Newswires, asking not to be named. 

Although the fully-subscribed offering was just about 1.7 times covered around three hours before closing Friday, most bids came in at the upper end of the price band, the people said. 

The offering will raise close to 4.38 billion rupees through the share sale at the top end of the band, including the 658 million rupees worth of shares sold to three anchor investors on March 15. 

The company raised 658 million rupees by placing 23.5 million shares with three anchor investors--HSBC Bank Mauritius Ltd., Capital International Emerging Markets Fund and Emerging Markets Growth Fund Inc--at 28 rupees a share. 

The IPO was managed by SBI Capital Markets Ltd., JM Financial Consultants Pvt. Ltd., and ICICI Securities Ltd., along with Almondz Global Securities Ltd. and Avendus Capital Pvt. Ltd. 

This is the largest initial share sale to be launched so far this year and will be seen as a key barometer of primary market appetite in the coming months, as the government prepares to push through its divestment program, valued at 400 billion rupees, to help pare its gaping fiscal deficit. 

A long list of private firms, including L&T Finance Holdings Ltd., Micromax Informatics Ltd. and Future Ventures India Ltd. are also seeking to tap the primary share market in the coming months.
