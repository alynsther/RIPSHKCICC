European stocks ended lower on Friday, with Portugal especially weak, as euro-zone debt worries persisted and a U.S. payrolls report dashed the anticipation that had built for strong jobs growth.

The Stoxx Europe 600 index slipped 0.2% to 281.02 but managed a weekly gain of 1.9%, marking five weekly advances in the past six. 

"We shouldn't get too hung up on day-to-day movements in stock prices," said  Peter Dixon, an analyst at Commerzbank. "If you look at the markets generally, the upper trend remains broadly intact and nothing has happened in the last couple of days to lead us to change that view."

Portugal led the Continent lower, as the cost of insuring euro-zone debt rose on concerns about forthcoming bond issuance by Lisbon, and the ongoing political stalemate in Belgium.

In the U.S., the 103,000 jobs added last month was a disappointment after expectations had built mid-week following a report that showed a surge in private-sector employment in December.

The payroll number was countered by positive net revisions to the October and November figures, Danske Bank said in a note, as well as by a drop in the jobless rate to 9.4%, the lowest since May 2009. 

Negative sentiment over the jobs report was compounded by an adverse foreclosure ruling for banks in Massachusetts, sending U.S. financial stocks lower. Early afternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 67 points, or 0.6%, to 11630. 

Treasurys, in response, rallied broadly. The benchmark 10-year note was 20/32 higher, pushing the yield down to 3.324%.
