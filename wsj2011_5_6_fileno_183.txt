BERLINâ€”German industrial production climbed more than expected in March, data showed Friday, as steady growth continues for Europe's largest economy. 

Industrial production rose a seasonally adjusted 0.7% in March from February, and by 11.2% compared with a year earlier, the economics ministry said Friday. Economists had expected industrial output to rise 0.3% from the previous month. 

"The upward trend for industry is continuing, though the dynamic could develop more moderately going forward," the ministry said in a statement accompanying the data. 

The increase follows a 1.7% monthly rise in February that was higher than initial estimates and the release of data Thursday showing that manufacturing orders unexpectedly plunged 4.0% in March, largely due to a sudden fall in demand for investment goods. 

Output in March was driven by a spike in construction activity, up 6.2% month-to-month after an already strong 3.4% monthly increase in February, the economics ministry said. 

Manufacturing output also climbed by 0.5% month-to-month, following a 1.8% increase in February. 

Within the manufacturing sector, production of capital and consumer goods rose 0.8% on the month in March, while production of intermediate goods rose a monthly 0.3%. 

Output in the energy sector bucked the trend, declining 1.2%. 

In the February-March period, a measurement that irons out fluctuations in the data, output was up 2.9% over the December-January period.
