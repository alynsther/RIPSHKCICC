Concerns about inflation in Asia sparked a wave of selling in Indonesia, Japan and South Korea on Friday, but stocks in China, one of the region's inflation epicenters, recovered some of Thursday's big declines.



Japan's Nikkei Stock Average fell 1.6% to 10274.52, South Korea's Kospi dropped 1.7% to 2069.92 while Indonesia's JSX Composite fell 2.2% to 3379.54.

"Foreigners are becoming a little concerned about the inflationary trend and tightening at central banks. Countries with high inflation are being sold down," said  Yoji Takeda, head of Asian equities at RBC Investment. 

The drop in Japan, where inflation isn't a problem, came on rising expectations that China will raise interest rates, tempering demand for goods from abroad.

China's Shanghai Composite index rose 1.4% to 2715.29, after shedding 2.9% Thursday after stronger-than-expected economic data fueled fears of more measures to cool the economy. But analysts were skeptical that the gains could hold. Indeed, the index lost 2.7% for the week, its worst weekly showing in two months.

"The market is still in a downward trend, as all eyes are on whether China can keep inflation in check," said Capital Securities analyst  Li Bin, citing the increasing likelihood of a 5% rise in China's consumer-price index in the first quarter. 

Adding to those concerns, the state-run China Securities Journal said in a commentary Friday that the first rate hike this year could be around the Lunar New Year holiday in early February. The paper said China faces strong inflation pressures and the consumer-price index could rise more than 6% within the first half of the year. 

  Soichiro Mori, a senior strategist at FXOnline Japan, said that inflation of over 6% for China "is shocking, but not completely unrealistic." China's CPI gains slowed to 4.6% in December from 5.1% in November, but that was probably due to "a brief weakening in consumer spending due to cold weather in winter," he said. 

As China goes into the Lunar New Year holidays in early February, consumption may accelerate, which will likely result in higher inflation, he added. 

Shares in Indonesia, among the best performers in Asia last year, continued to fall as investors fretted about likely interest-rate increases by the nation's central bank in coming months to check rising prices there. Inflation last year reached 6.96%, well above the upper limit of the bank's target of 4% to 6%. Unilever Indonesia dropped 6.6%. 

Commodity-related shares in the region were hit hard on worries that Beijing's policy tightening could dampen the country's consumption and dent commodity prices.  Sumitomo Metal Mining
