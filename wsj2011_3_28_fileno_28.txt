Mumbai -- Investment banking revenue for deals originating out of India declined 35% to $114 million in the first quarter of this year, the second largest drop in the Asia-Pacific region, even as global revenue rose 6%. 

Data from  Dealogic Plc indicates that sluggish equity and debt capital markets have resulted in lower revenue – down 18% and 66%, respectively, from last year. Revenue from mergers and acquisitions, however, have risen 19% to $43 million, with $18.6 billion of M&A transactions announced this quarter.

Investment banking revenue in other Asia-Pacific regions such as China, Hong Kong and Australia has risen –- by 8.1%, 4.7% and 4%, respectively.

Abizer Diwanji, executive director at KPMG India Pvt. Ltd, notes that while equity capital markets could see some breakthrough in the next six months, pricing has largely deterred deals. 

"Equity markets are not supporting promoter expectations and valuations," he said. Debt capital markets, more an "over-the-counter" business, are not that developed.

The quarter also has seen changes in the top five investment banks -– with Citigroup Global Markets India Pvt. Ltd taking the lead, followed by Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd, Lazard India Pvt. Ltd, Standard Chartered and SBI Capital Markets Ltd in that order. They rank as the top five earners for the first quarter of 2011.
