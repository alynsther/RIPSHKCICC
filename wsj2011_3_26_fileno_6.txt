Maybe Gotham's basketball scene isn't quite as broken as everybody thinks it is. 

During the NCAA men's basketball tournament, city kids haven't just been playing important roles—in many cases, they're threatening to steal the show. And here's the thing that's even more encouraging about it: Most of them are stylish guards. 

Once upon a time, of course, New York was hailed as the world's mecca for great point-guard play. Some of its products include Kenny Anderson, Stephon Marbury, Mark Jackson, Lenny Wilkens and Sebastian Telfair. 

By any standard, the factory hasn't been cranking out new models with the frequency it used to. The dearth of New York guards could be seen in high schools, local colleges and the pros, where even Europeans seemed to be having more success.

But as of press time Thursday, at least three teams in the Elite Eight were helped by New York-area products. all of whom have taken their teams farther than anyone expected. A handful of others have shined.
