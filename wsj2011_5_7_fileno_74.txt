Louis Vuitton's Speedy bag has been beloved by demure ladies like Sophia Loren and Audrey Hepburn since its inception as the "Express" tote in 1930. Now the French house has a new style for summer, the Bandoulière, which comes with a handy detachable shoulder strap. For the campaign, stylist Caroline Sieber (near left), dressed in her favorites from LV's Pre-Fall collection, posed on a bicycle—a clever use of the style, which is perfect for lazy weekend pedals to the farmer's market.  louisvuitton.com  



Fashioned aftericonic pieces from the Emporio Armani archives, the Italian house's new capsule collection for men and women channels Armani's greatest hits.

Persol, the 94-year-old Italian eyewear brand, has created a new style inspired by early 1900s roadsters and their daredevil drivers—the first racers to compete on an oval track. The two sunglasses—the Roadster TF in black and Roadster GT in tortoise—take their design cues from specific parts of the elegant autos, including the screws and rivets found on the hood and the stripes from the model's air vents. The only other thing you'll need is sunshine and a fast ride.  persol.com
