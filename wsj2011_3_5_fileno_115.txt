In times past, a child could learn to draw cartoons from the back of a matchbox. Today kids and matches aren't allowed to mix, and the comics are graphic novels. Ivan Brunetti steps into this breach and provides aspiring Art Spiegelmans with a simple yet sophisticated guide, 'Cartooning: Philosophy and Practice' (Yale, 78 pages, $13). His purpose is not to teach drawing per se (though he insists on daily practice) but to inculcate a sense of cartoons as an essentially literary form—'writing in pictures,' as he puts it—one that creates narrative as economically as possible. The author can be a no-nonsense taskmaster, insisting that students first learn to tell stories through a single panel before permitting them to pursue more complex narratives. Yet a warm sense of humor leavens the heavy burdens. Above, he shows how J.D. Salinger's 'The Catcher in the Rye' can be boiled down into a single frame, building the figure of Holden Caulfield from a hunched back and a hunting cap, adding barren trees and a bleak cityscape, and settling at last on the ideal one-word caption.
