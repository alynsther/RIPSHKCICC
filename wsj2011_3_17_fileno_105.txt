BEIJING—China Mobile Ltd., the world's biggest wireless operator by subscribers, said Wednesday its net profit rose 3.9% last year, as tougher competition and additions of low-income mobile subscribers in rural areas balanced out growth in the company's third-generation wireless business. 

The operator's earnings growth has been slowing because of increasing competition from  China Unicom Ltd. and  China Telecom Corp. The three companies are competing to add users for their 3G services, which offer faster data speeds and more revenue per user than the second-generation services much more widely used in China. 

China Mobile said its annual profit rose to 119.64 billion yuan ($18.2 billion) from 115.17 billion yuan in 2009. The profit growth exceeded the 2.3% it reported for 2009 but was well below the 30% rise notched for 2008. Revenue last year rose 7.3% to 485.2 billion yuan from 452.10 billion yuan, beating analysts' forecasts. 

China Mobile said it plans to increase capital expenditure to 132.4 billion yuan this year from 124.3 billion yuan in 2010. Early last year, it had issued a much-lower projection of 98 billion yuan in capital expenditures for this year. About 53% of that budget this year is earmarked for infrastructure networks, up from 44% last year. 

The company said it now plans capital expenditure of 130.4 billion yuan in 2012 and 125.5 billion yuan in 2013. 

China Mobile's average revenue per user—an industry barometer to determine the long-term growth rate of telecom firms—continued its slide, falling to 73 yuan last year from 77 yuan a year earlier. 

The company's 2010 net profit was above the average 118.78 billion yuan forecast of eight analysts polled by Dow Jones Newswires. 

The company said increasing mobile penetration in China will further intensify competition. China Mobile added 61.7 million mobile users last year, compared with 65 million additions in 2009, bringing its total subscriber base at the end of 2010 to 584 million accounts. 

Of China's three major carriers, China Mobile had the largest number of 3G subscribers at the end of December with 20.7 million, compared with China Unicom's 14.06 million and China Telecom's 12.3 million. 

China Mobile on Wednesday also said one of its units agreed to pay 237 million yuan to acquire China Topssion Communication Co., which sells mobile phones and other devices, to expand China Mobile's device distribution and retail business. 

The unit, China Mobile Communication Co., will buy China Topssion shares from shareholders including China Mobile's parent company, China Mobile Communications Corp., which owns 29% of China Topssion's share capital. 

Chinese telecom-equipment maker  ZTE Corp. owns 16% of China Topssion's share capital, while  Eastern Communications Co., Beijing Digital China Ltd. and  Ningbo Bird Co. each own 15%, and Shenzhen Huawei Investment & Holdings Co. owns 10%, China Mobile said.

China Mobile will further seek "appropriate investment opportunities in an active but cautious manner" to expand in the telecoms market, it said. 

China Mobile recommended a final dividend of 1.597 Hong Kong dollars (20 U.S. cents) a share, up from HK$1.458 a year earlier. It said it will maintain its full-year dividend payout unchanged at 43% in 2010 to reserve cash for future development.
