If we've learned one thing from the barrage of status updates from our friends at concert venues and sports arenas lately, it's that the only thing better than going to a memorable live event is being able to brag to everybody who isn't present that you scored tickets. How's the saying go? If it's not on Facebook, it didn't happen?

But what about our favorite sporting and musical memories from the pre-social networking era left moldering, forgotten at the bottom of some drawer? What if you're a Yankees fan who was at opening day in 1978 for the infamous "Reggie Bar" game, where fans littered the field with candy? Maybe you saw Patti Smith play in Central Park on the night of a torrential downpour in August of 1979, Ozzy Osbourne with opening act Mötley Crüe on the Bark at the Moon tour in 1984 or Gretzky's last game at Madison Square Garden?

If you're like the users of the new website StubStory.com, you'll take the ticket stubs you've been keeping for sentimental reasons, scan them, post your memories online and garner all the retroactive cred you've been missing out on.

"Food triggers memories, smells, and tickets trigger memories too," says the site's founder, Matt Peter. "When there are 80,000 people in a building watching a game, they all share one thing in common: that ticket stub."

But years later, none of those cherished ticket stubs end up being exactly alike either in appearance or personal significance. That's the beauty of the site: It lets the faceless names in the crowd assert their own place in historic events, be it a pivotal World Series win, the first Coachella Music Festival or just an early performance from a beloved band. Which reminds me, did I ever tell anyone about the time I saw the Strokes at a tiny art gallery in Somerville, Mass., in 2001? You really had to be there.
