Stock indexes drifted slightly higher Wednesday as investors parsed President Obama's plan to slash the deficit and remained wary about the earnings power of major banks.

The Standard & Poor's 500 index snapped a four-day slump as it eked out a 0.25-point gain, or less than 1%, to 1314.41. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 7.41 points, or 0.1%, to 12270.99, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite advanced 16.73, or 0.6%, to 2761.52.

Financial stocks were among the biggest drags on blue chips as investors reassessed what they initially read as a positive earnings report from  J.P. Morgan Chase.

 The big bank reported a 67% jump in quarterly profit, but there were concerns about regulators' move to sanction the mortgage industry over the handling of mortgage foreclosures. There were also worries about weakness at the company's retail bank. J.P. Morgan's shares fell 39 cents, or 0.8%, to $46.25, and  Bank of America

 dropped 20 cents, or 1.5%, to 13.27. 

"Early this morning there was a general sense that the market liked J.P. Morgan's results, but as the [day] wore on, there was greater concern about the lack of revenue growth and the reliance on provisioning to meet their earnings number,"  Howard Ward, chief investment officer for Gamco Growth Fund, said.

Stocks were somewhat boosted by President Obama's plan to slash the U.S. budget deficit by $4 trillion over the next 12 years through a combination of spending cuts and tax increases, though shares tied to the defense industry sagged.  Boeing

Many investors were still wary of making large commitments at the start of earnings season. "Some of these big-cap stocks have had a move higher ahead of earnings,"  John Brady, senior vice president at MF Global said, and have moved far enough that money managers have grown more reluctant to push the indexes further, he added. 

Among stocks in focus,  MGM Resorts International jumped 1.09, or 8.6%, to 13.70, after the casino operator said it reached an agreement with Macau mogul  Pansy Ho for a majority stake in a Chinese joint venture after that venture's initial public offering.
