The colorful Jack Rogers sandal has been a staple of the Palm Beach and Southampton set since it was introduced in 1960. On Wednesday the brand—which has expanded into more shoes (even in black!), accessories, women's clothing and men's ties—opened its first free-standing boutique on upper Madison Avenue. Fans like Jamee Gregory, Jennifer Creel, Lisa Birnbach and Celerie Kemble swung by. 

"We're moving way beyond the open-toe sandal," said Jack Rogers' new creative director Lauren duPont, who added that she owns upward of 50 pairs of the iconic shoe, known for its whipstitch punches and signature rondelle. "We're about the resort lifestyle. Whimsical. Color. Fun. Those are some words we like to use."

"But we realize the sun doesn't shine up in New York every day," said Steven Stolman, the design director. "And it isn't always 75 degrees. I haven't lived here for 15 years, but people do wear flip-flops year round."

"Especially because there's a nail salon on every block," Ms. DuPont added. 

Ms. duPont said that her position entailed choosing everything from fabrics—she loves burlap—to the mirrors on the wall in the boutique to the aquamarine, very Palm Beach cocktail napkins accompanying the cucumber sandwiches being passed at the launch.

"She's very expensive talent to be picking out napkins," said the brand's chairman, Bill Smith.
