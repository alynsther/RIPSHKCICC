 to a potential purchaser for about 1.08 billion yuan (US$164 million).

"The offer represents an estimated premium of 72% over the book value of our investment resulting in a gain of approximately 76 million Singapore dollars (US$60 million) after deducting foreign exchange and transaction related expenses," APB Chief Executive  Roland Pirmez said in a statement.

"By virtue of its 50% stake in Heineken-APB China, APB's share of the gain from disposal will be approximately S$38 million."

The company said the agreement with a potential purchaser to divest will lapse if GDH Ltd., the controlling shareholder of Kingway Brewery, exercises its pre-emption right to acquire the sale shares on the same terms it sold the stake to Heineken-APB in 2004.
