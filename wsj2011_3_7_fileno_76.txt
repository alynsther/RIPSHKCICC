PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla.â€”Carlos Beltran went 1 for 3 in his first spring-training game Sunday against the Boston Red Sox. But perhaps the most encouraging sign for the Mets was what he did on the base paths.

Wearing a brace over his arthritic right knee, Beltran led off the second inning with a line-drive single to right field. He was standing on second base when Daniel Murphy singled to right. And instead of holding him at third, Mets third-base coach Chip Hale waved Beltran home.

Beltran lumbered around third, slid into home plate and, most importantly, made it back to the dugout unharmed.

"I can't tell you what was going through my mind," Mets manager Terry Collins said. "I asked Chip Hale, 'What the [heck]?' Chip said, 'I'm testing him.' "

Beltran's hit came from the left side of the plate against Red Sox right-hander Michael Bowden. His other two at-bats were from the right side against lefty Andrew Miller.

Assuming Beltran's knee responds well, he is expected to be the designated hitter for another seven to 10 days before playing right field.

"I was a little bit anxious at the plate, but I saw the ball well," Beltran said. "In order for me to get ready for the season, I need to see live pitching. Today was a first step."
