NEW YORKâ€”Stocks rose in the final session of the strongest January in years, sloughing off worries over the unrest in Egypt as investors took heart that the Suez Canal was still open. 

A better-than-expected round of U.S. economic data also helped bolster the market. 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 68.23 points, or 0.6%, to 11891.93. The measure rose 2.7% in January, marking the first January advance in four years and the best January performance in 14 years. 

The Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 13.19, or 0.5%, to 2700.08. It rose 1.8% on the month, snapping a string of three straight January declines. 

The Standard & Poor's 500 stock index added 9.78, or 0.8%, to 1286.12. It climbed 2.3% in January, representing the first January rise since 2007 and the best January performance since 2006.

The energy sector led the ascent as crude-oil prices topped $92 a barrel on the continued turmoil in Egypt. Egypt isn't a major oil exporter, but the Suez Canal and Sumed pipeline transport roughly three million barrels a day through the country.

 helped to bolster the sector. The oil giant's fourth-quarter earnings surged 53%, beating analysts' expectations thanks to higher oil prices, improved refining profit margins and its unconventional gas production operations. The stock rose $1.69, or 2.1%, to $80.68. Rival  Chevron

 also was strong, righting 1.56, or 1.7%, to 94.93.

Monday's broad advance came as investors digested the latest reports out of Egypt, where protest organizers were calling for one million people to march Tuesday to demand the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak. On the seventh straight day of demonstrations, Mr. Mubarak overhauled the government in his latest attempt to defuse unprecedented public anger at his 30-year rule.

The unrest drove stocks to the biggest one-day drop in months on Friday as fears ramped up that the Suez Canal could be closed. But after shippers over the weekend and early Monday said traffic was still moving.

"In the short run while people are apprehensive, the canal's still flowing," said  Derek Rollingson, portfolio manager of the ICON Energy Fund. He said that was boosting the U.S. stock market broadly, as investors viewed the canal's continued operation of a sign that the situation in Egypt hadn't gotten as bad as their worst fears. 

U.S. economic data helped to support Monday's climb in stocks, with the latest reading of consumer spending showing U.S. consumers, supported by fatter paychecks and low prices, accelerated spending at the end of 2010 by more than expected. The Chicago Business Barometer also topped expectations and a separate report showed inflation still remains below the mark central bankers consider consistent with price stability.

Investors were also encouraged by comments from Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Dennis Lockhart, who said the U.S. economic recovery, while ongoing, still needs the support of supportive monetary policy.
