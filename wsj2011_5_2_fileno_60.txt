Before they headed down to Washington on Saturday, a lot of the cute comedy crowd ventured to Freedom Hall Friday at the Ace Hotel. They were going to the Stoli-sponsored Good Old Fashioned after-party for the Tribeca Film Festival premiere of the comedy "A Good Old Fashioned Orgy."

Leading up to the evening, actress Lake Bell, who stars in the film about a group of friends who plan to have one last summer hurrah, was making lots of orgy jokes. "Are you coming to our orgy?" she said. "I'm excited you'll be a part of it."

Peter Huyck, the film's co-director, said that at Easter, with his parents, he hadn't been referring to the movie by its actual title. "We just have been calling it 'A Good Old Fashioned,'" he said.
