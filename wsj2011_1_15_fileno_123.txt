NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (apod.nasa.gov/apod) captures a range of phenomena from space: colliding galaxies, spidery nebulae, odd Martian features and comets, stars and eclipses as seen from Earth. Each photo—from NASA as well as amateur photographers—includes a short, informative caption, written by astronomers Jerry Bonnell and Robert Nemiroff. The coming year promises new looks at Mercury as the Messenger spacecraft enters its orbit, a close-up view of the asteroid Vesta and two total eclipses of the moon. Here is a look at some recent images.
