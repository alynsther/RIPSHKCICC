There may be a way to pay less than face value for event tickets. ScoreBig.com, a website launched last month, lets you bid on tickets to sporting events, concerts, and arts and theater performances. And it guarantees you'll get at least 10% off a ticket's face value.

One caveat: Currently, there may be less than a week's wait to join the free site, based on ticket inventory, says  Adam Kanner, ScoreBig's CEO. You can join instantly if an existing member invites you.

Once you've registered on the site, you can search for tickets by city or event. You can't choose an exact seat, but you can select from seats with various prices.

You'll get a list of prices for available tickets, which include service and delivery fees, and then you plug in the price you're willing to pay. Your bid is either accepted or rejected with a counter offer, which you can, in turn, accept or reject. You can bid for a maximum of eight tickets per transaction.

The following tickets recently sold at a discount of 10% to 24% off their stated price: mid-level seats to a Jan. 11 Los Angeles Lakers vs. the Cleveland Cavaliers basketball game in Los Angeles, going for $137.88; and $202.96 top-tier tickets to an April 12 Lady Gaga concert in Sunrise, Fla.

ScoreBig gets its inventory from venues, teams, leagues, promoters, brokers and companies looking to unload unsold and unused tickets.
