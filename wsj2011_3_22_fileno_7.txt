On Saturday Penn State coach Cael Sanderson brought the school its first NCAA wrestling title since 1953. But perhaps his more impressive accomplishment is maintaining the edge that once made him the sport's greatest champion.

Sanderson completed his college career at Iowa State in 2002 with a perfect record of 159-0 and was named the outstanding wrestler of the NCAA tournament four times. He went on to win gold at the Athens Olympics in 2004. 

Seven years later, how does he do scrimmaging against the young guns on the country's best team? The Penn State wrestling room now includes a national champion, Quentin Wright, who is roughly the same size as Sanderson. When asked whether any of the team's current grapplers ever beat him in practice, Sanderson pauses. "I don't know how to answer that," he says. "I'm an old man. These are kids." 

Does this mean that some members of the Nittany Lion squad can actually take him now? When pressed, Sanderson finally reveals the answer. 

"If I'm getting beat by a college kid," he says, "it's not going to happen any time soon."
