Vladimir Zharkov scored his first NHL goal, and the suddenly potent Devils broke out again in a victory over the Islanders on Monday. Mr. Zharkov started the Devils' latest barrage in the first period before Ilya Kovalchuk doubled the lead 57 seconds later. 

New Jersey also got a pair of goals 54 seconds apart from Rod Pelley and Dainius Zubrus in the second period after the Islanders trimmed a three-goal deficit to one.

The Devils (13-29-3) closed within six points of the Islanders (14-23-7) as they try to escape the NHL cellar.
