Brickson Diamond, the chairman of the Blackhouse Foundation, attended Sundance for the first time in 2005. That was the year Craig Brewer's "Hustle and Flow" premiered, one of the Festival's big success stories. At the screening, "people were racing up and down the aisles," Mr. Diamond recalled. "It was such an exciting moment." 

Other than that, at Sundance, he said, "I didn't see any black people."

So along with a few friends, Mr. Diamond, who until recently was in financial services, helped found nonprofit Blackhouse, with the goal of expanding opportunities for black filmmakers. 

Since 2006, the group has rented a space to create a presence in Park City, hosting parties, panels and the like. On Saturday, along with Moët & Chandon, Blackhouse held a big dinner honoring the actors Terrence Howard and Joy Bryant. Playwrights Lynn Nottage and George C. Wolfe were there, as was the actor Danny Glover and a host of executives, agents and other Hollywood types.

"Sundance can seem very snow-like," said host Bevy Smith of Harlem, mixing her metaphors.

"We're not selling anything, we're not promoting anything," said Mr. Diamond. "It's just that now, when we're here, people don't say, 'Look, over there, there's a black person.'"
