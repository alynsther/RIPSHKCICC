This Isaiah is one of the most ecstatic works of art ever coaxed from stone. Carved nearly 900 years ago by an unknown hand for the abbey church of St. Marie in Souillac, in southwestern France, the prophet—nearly six feet tall—seems as if he's dancing, his cloak and gown flourishing with his rejoicing. How could something so solid be so expressive? The sculpture alone is worth a trip to the Midi-Pyrénées— and that's the pleasant problem with "Ars Sacra" (H.F. Ullmann, 800 pages, $199), where the Isaiah is beautifully shown in a nearly 17-inch image. The book is a monumental survey of 1,700 years of Christian art, and it stirs a longing to hit the road and see these sublime works and buildings first-hand. Going to Souillac would make visiting Moissac, about 60 miles away, irresistible: The editors include another Romanesque gem, the Abbaye St. Pierre, with its tympanum of the Last Judgment and a Jeremiah possibly by the Isaiah artist. But the book's brilliant color reproductions range across the world and show us everything from third-century wall paintings to stained glass by Gerhard Richter. For anyone whose travels include stops to look at sacred art, "Ars Sacra" will be a godsend.
