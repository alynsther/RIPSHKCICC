For a film about incarceration and torture within an oppressive regime, there
are a surprising number of laughs in “Rosewater,” opening Friday. When Iranian
authorities rifle through a journalist’s bedroom looking for evidence of
espionage and moral offenses, almost everything they find, including a
“Sopranos” DVD, prompts the same accusatory question: “Porno?”

Like the more tragic events in “Rosewater,” the absurd details come from “Then
They Came for Me,” a memoir by Maziar Bahari, an Iranian-Canadian reporter
arrested...

Kobe Bryant appears to be in the twilight of his career. He is still showing
flashes of his greatness, but his moves aren’t nearly as graceful. On Tuesday
night, he broke a not-so-glamorous NBA record.

The Los Angeles Lakers star took 26 shots and missed 16 in a loss to the
Memphis Grizzlies, breaking the career mark for missed field-goal attempts.
Bryant also moved into third all-time for most field-goal attempts, passing
Michael Jordan. But unlike Bryant, Jordan isn’t in the all-time top-five in
misses.

The Count looked into how the 36-year-old Bryant compares to Jordan at similar
points in their careers.

Through seven games this season, Bryant is taking 24 shots a game, the second-
most of his career. His 39.3% field-goal percentage is the lowest of his 19
seasons, with a high of 46.9% in 2001-02.

By comparison, Jordan played 15 seasons—broken up by two so-called
retirements—and shot better than 50% six times.

While Jordan didn’t play at age 36—that was during his second hiatus—perhaps
his final two years, at ages 38 and 39 for the Washington Wizards, provide the
best comparison for Bryant these days. Like Bryant this year, Jordan absorbed
a heavy load on a losing team, posting two of his three worst career shooting
clips.

In fairness to Bryant, the differences in their career shooting percentages
can be explained, at least in part, by their shot selection: Bryant’s career
per-game average of 3.9 three-point attempts is more than twice what Jordan
averaged (1.7). Bryant’s 33.5% three-point percentage is higher than Jordan’s
(32.7%), too. But if you look at effective field-goal percentage—which
accounts for the fact that three-pointers are worth more than two-
pointers—Jordan (.509, according to Basketball-Reference) comes out ahead of
Bryant (.487).

BRUSSELS—European Union lawmakers overwhelmingly approved a trade and
political agreement with Moldova on Thursday, one of several such pacts in the
region that have angered Russia.

The European Parliament voted 535-94 to back the agreement, which will set up
a free-trade zone between Moldova, a former Soviet republic sandwiched between
Ukraine...

**Any argument **about which college-basketball program is the best of all time comes with a guarantee: No one is going to win the debate.

What makes the conversation so contentious is that there isn’t a perfect way
to measure historical might. Every men’s basketball blue blood can make its
own claim of supremacy. UCLA has its record 11 national championships.
Kentucky has the most victories. North Carolina can point to its unmatched
total of 18 Final Four appearances.

#### College Basketball’s Ultimate Bragging Rights

  * [See a sortable chart of how schools rank based on the percentage of significant opponents whom they hold an edge over in their all-time series.](http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/st_HOOPSSORT111320141113.html)

With the college season tipping off on Friday, The Wall Street Journal came up
with its own calculation. We examined the historical results of 156
schools—the sport’s winningest programs plus other teams that have made the
NCAA tournament in the last five years—and then stacked them up against each
other. The goal was to figure out each school’s winning percentage in its
head-to-head series against these other basketball schools. Which school, in
other words, truly has the most bragging rights?

The team that came out on top: the Kentucky Wildcats.

Kentucky, which is also college basketball’s top team in terms of winning
percentage, leads nearly 88% of its series against this select group of the
most relevant teams in college basketball, according to the schools’ records.

As any citizen of Big Blue Nation could tell you, Kentucky rose to prominence
with Adolph Rupp as the Wildcats’ coach between 1930 and 1972, when they won
four of their eight national titles. Joe B. Hall,  Rick Pitino and Tubby Smith
also won championships at Kentucky. The program has been revitalized in recent
years by John Calipari, who raised his first title banner in Rupp Arena in
2012.

Our historical champion is also the No. 1 team in this year’s preseason
polls—even though its current roster doesn’t have much history. Kentucky,
which lost to Connecticut in last season’s national-title game, is once again
in the hunt with a roster of nine high-school All-Americans, eight of whom are
freshmen or sophomores.

It isn’t a surprise that Kentucky won our study. But the rest of the top five
represents a shake-up of the commonly accepted order.

1993.](http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-
FN745_hoops1_P_20141113155334.jpg) ENLARGE

No. 2 is Duke. By standard measurements, the Blue Devils don’t rank so high.
They are fifth in winning percentage, and five other schools have matched or
exceeded Duke’s four national titles. But Duke leads 83% of its series against
relevant programs, second-best nationally.

Kansas is No. 3, despite owning the second-most victories in basketball
history after Kentucky. UCLA, the team with the most titles ever, has a slight
edge over North Carolina, which is No. 2 in winning percentage.

Just as underdogs always emerge in the NCAA tournament, there are further
upsets in these rankings. UNLV, a 1980s powerhouse with the NCAA’s fourth-
highest winning percentage, leads the pack of schools from non-major
conferences in this study. The list of other surprising mid-majors includes
Dayton (32nd), Bradley (33rd) and New Mexico (38th).

Then there are the historical oddities. Those are to be expected when some of
these series consist of just one game many years ago. While the Ivy League
performed poorly—Princeton, Penn, Cornell and Harvard all placed outside of
the top 75—the eggheads managed to score some victories. Princeton, for
example, has an all-time edge on Georgetown, despite famously losing by one to
the Hoyas in the 1989 NCAA tournament as a No. 16 seed.

Kentucky is vulnerable to these peculiarities, too. Although the Wildcats lead
their series against Duke, Kansas and UCLA, the small list of teams that have
an all-time edge on Kentucky includes Saint Louis and UAB. Those losses will
linger, too: Kentucky isn’t scheduled to play either this season.

Kentucky - my alma mater.  Maybe that's why I like football.  As an undergrad,
there were always great seats to watch the SEC powerhouses come to play and
use us as a "floor mat" -- but fun just the same!  On the other hand, getting
in to see Rupp's team (yes I am that old) do their magic was not that easy.

scandal. Wah was never implicated. He remains the only athlete who played for
both Bear Bryant (then the UK football coach) and the Baron of the Bluegrass.
Wah died a few months ago , a beloved figure in KY athletics and surely one of
the greatest of all college athletes. Also served several terms as Sheriff of
Fayette County ,KY . A great guy to boot!

Sorry, but when you talk about "college basketball" the answer has to be
UConn.

  

This article only talks about men's college basketball, not "college
basketball."

  

If you talk about the best college basketball program, men's and women's
combined, only UConn has won both the men's and women's tournament in the same
year  --  twice  -- and between the two programs they have something like 13
national championships, more than any other school (9 women 4 men IIRC).

The one thing that I hate is the "one and done" that has happened to Div 1
basketball.  The NCAA is the minor league system for the NBA.  I would love to
see a rule for basketball and football similar to MLB Rule 4 Draft.  If a kid
does not want to go to college, let him go directly to the minor league
system, just like baseball.

  

Also, college athletes should be expected to complete a full academic year
(fall & spring semesters) of the academic year they participated.  If they do
not, the college should be punished with a lose of scholarship.

One thing to remember, KU, UK and UNC all play in buildings named after
Jayhawks.  If you look at the coaching tree that started with James Naismith
and "Phog" Allen, there are very few programs that have the impact of college
basketball as KU.

  

Rock Chalk, Jayhawk!

comes to ranking the best countries at soccer.  UK basically thanked KU for
inventing the game and said, "Thanks, we'll take it from here".

A useless analysis without citing the Kentucky legacy of crime (point shaving
with Ralph Beard, Alex Groza & Wah Wah Jones); ethics violations (Chris Mills
cash); blowing off second semester classes to play in the NCAA Tournament,
then train for the NBA draft; and sundry other no-nos that we are forgetting
in our old age.

[@William Miller](http://online.wsj.com/user/profile/public/E1_0Z6yUuyMaJZbBCO
ZRvMurQ%3D%3D_E1) Laughable.  First off, the blowing off 2nd semester classes
is a lie. Does not happen at UK.  Lie, propagated by none other than disgraced
IU coach Bobby Knight. It DOES happen at UNC though, as admitted by McCant's
recently.

UNC just had the largest cheating scandal in NCAA history exposed, and will
likely be forfeiting multiple banner.

UCLA players were ALL being paid during their run (a well known fact, admitted
to by multiple players), and even their last title was under Jim Harrick, who
was busted for cheating.

KU has been on probation multiple times, including under Larry Brown, and more
recently due to the actions of Roy Williams.  Plus the recent McLemore/Agent
connection.

Duke has gotten away with violations that would have caused FF forfeitures
(Magette, Lance Thomas).

IU was busted for cheating, after hiring a coach known for cheating not too
long ago.

Yet, you only mention UK's transgressions, none of which have been in the last
25 years? Again, laughable.

reputation.

Total numbers UCLA alumni in NBA Hall of Fame: 9 UK: 6

Some total numbers such as the 17 number you pointed out are not equally
weighted.

Other total numbers are more equally weighted like total number of NCAA
championships or consecutive number of championships.

Unlike most other Big Ten schools there hasn't been a lot of competition from
Illinois' s football program in recent years. There was such an electric
atmosphere at Assembly Hall when I was there in the late '90s and early 2000s.

Unbiased reporting from a Dook alumni.

Guess you did not read the wsj article from your colleague about UCLA
producing the most tenured NBA players as well as most NBA greats. It adds up
to UCLA envy. Dook will not surpass UCLA overall Titles in NCAA anytime soon,
nor will UK.

guys who left college five years ago or more. Current NBA rosters have 17 guys
from Kentucky, more than any school.

The committee behind the inaugural College Football Playoff Rankings has a
difficult job. Before putting four teams in line for a cherished playoff spot,
it has to look at each school’s record, conference championships, head-to-head
competition and comparative outcomes against common opponents.

But what would the rankings look like if we ignored all the wins and losses
and just focused purely on performance?

Each week, Cade Massey, from the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School,
and Rufus Peabody, a Las Vegas sports analyst, rank all 128 college-football
teams based off a mathematical model that takes only on-field performance into
account. In other words, the model is purely objective and is stripped of
outcome bias such as wins and losses that are often the product of mere
chance.

The model looks at four statistics to evaluate offenses and defenses—rushing,
passing, scoring and how effectively the ball is advanced relative to down and
distance. The data is adjusted for home field and game situation, and weighted
by predictive ability. (For more information on their methodology, visit
[massey-peabody.com](http://massey-peabody.com/).)

Like the committee’s rankings, the Massey-Peabody model factors in strength of
schedule—otherwise 9-0 Marshall would be the best team in the country. Unlike
the committee, the Massey-Peabody rankings also include preseason expectation,
which has proved to have value when predicting team performance, even late in
the season.

To get a full sense of how the model works, we show where each school ranked
at the beginning of the season, where it ranks solely on its 2014 performance,
and where it ranks when preseason expectation and 2014 performance are
combined (best for predicting future outcomes). In the last column, we show
how each team would do against an average team on a neutral field.

This week, the four top spots in the committee’s rankings went to Mississippi
State, Oregon, Florida State and TCU. Needless to say, the Massey-Peabody
model doesn't concur.

Alabama is far and away the nation’s No. 1 team and it will be interesting to
see the committee’s response should the Crimson Tide take care of Mississippi
State at home this weekend. The MP model predicts a 12-point win for Alabama
even if the game was played on a neutral field. Ohio State is a solid No. 2
after one of the season’s best performances in East Lansing but would be
expected to lose to Alabama by nearly a touchdown on a neutral field. The
Massey-Peabody third and fourth best teams are very controversial as they both
have two losses and thus are far from being considered by the committee.
However, both Georgia and Auburn toil in the toughest conference in college
football, the SEC. Not even a field goal separates the committee’s No. 2 and
No. 3 teams, Oregon and Florida State, from the MP top-four. But the
committee’s top team, Mississippi State, is four points behind the MP model’s
fourth-ranked squad (Auburn) and TCU (the committee’s No. 4 team) trails by
five.

And unlike the official rankings, we also show where all 128 teams place. This
is bad news for fans of New Mexico State, which, according to the model, is
expected to lose to an average team by nearly 27 points.

Vegas gives Ohio state better odds of getting in the playoff than TCU.

  

OSU should leapfrog TSU into the top 4 if they beat 25th ranked Minnesota and
beat a top 12th ranked Nebraska in the B1G championship game. Just as the
committee put Oregon ahead of FSU , when both teams won last week, because
Oregon beat 19Th ranked Utah when FSU beat an unranked team.

The committee should be forced to choose amongst the 5 winners of the power
conferences for the 4 playoff spots

  

but first the Big 12 needs to get back to 12 teams and have a championship
game like the SEC, B1G, ACC and PAC 12

  

the conference championship game then acts like a playoff game, with only the
winners eligible for the playoff. The committee would merely choose the best
of 4 of the 5 conference champions. Then most of the conferences would be
happy each year. This would be like having a 10 team playoff, as 2 teams from
each conference play in the conference championship games.

The committee was born on the first weekend of November 2011 in Tuscaloosa,
Alabama when Bama missed 5 field goals and lost a razor thin game to LSU. The
committee was never about finding the "best" teams, the BCS did that. Just so
happens, in 2011 the two best teams in football, by a very wide margin, were
from the same division of the same conference.  Alabama and LSU played again
that season for the Championship.  That will not happen again.

The premise of this article, as well as the committee's apparent view of
college football is wrong.  Why even play the games then?  Why not just peruse
through history to find the best college football teams of any era and rank
them?  Where's the fun in that?  The polls should first reflect wins and
losses.  Only then should any other factor come into play. To quote Henry
Russell ("Red") Sanders, "Winning isn't everything. It's the only thing."

After MS State beats Alabama, Messrs Massey and Peabody better have a 2nd job
to fall back on.

forced to choose amongst the 5 winners of the power conferences for the 4
playoff spots," Why?

  

I have no doubt what you are saying is what will happen. But why consider the
champion of a conference that is maybe two teams deep, and give no
consideration to a team like Auburn or Alabama who, by any measure, played a
meatgrinder schedule but may not win their conference?

  

CFB is cyclical, the SEC and Southeastern football in general will not
dominate forever.

John, as a Spartan alum I will readily concede that tOSU was definitely the
better team, and deserved to win last weekend -- the Buckeyes had waaaayyyy
more team speed on O than did MSU -- but IMHO Ohio State could win the B1G and
still not get close to making the playoffs; they need a lot of help from other
teams to make "the final four" and in an SEC-centric college football world,
there are just too many hurdles in their way, and they don't control their own
destiny ...

WQcfxL3eGTN57aI9seJO60jAcDln7ltC6I3qYb4%2BIAeDES12Fp1ZHdVC9zEEdJA_E1) This is
why the committee should choose the best 4 of the 5 conference champions.
Usually one conference is weaker than the rest, but since they rarely play
each other is is based on speculation..Ideally the 4 playoff teams would be
forced to play each other the following season.

  

The playoff will be less interesting if we see Alabama playing Mississippi
state again. In addition ratings will be higher seeing teams from different
regions facing off against each other. The championship games would be like
the first round of the playoffs, with the losers kept out. It will probably
turn out this way most of the time anyway.
