LOS ANGELESâ€”Michael Jackson's physician pleaded not guilty Tuesday to a charge of involuntary manslaughter in the pop icon's death.

"Your honor, I am an innocent man," declared Conrad Murray to the judge in court. "I, therefore, plead not guilty."

The cardiologist was at the pop singer's Los Angeles home when he died in June 2009 at age 50. Coroners have determined that Mr. Jackson died from an overdose of a combination of the anesthetic propofol and other drugs, which the singer apparently used to induce sleep.

Dr. Murray, 57 years old, has acknowledged prescribing and administering propofol to Mr. Jackson.

Last month, Superior Court Judge Michael Pastor ordered Dr. Murray to stand trial for involuntary manslaughter after hearing testimony that he had given Mr. Jackson a lethal dose of propofol and other sedatives and then failed to provide proper care. Propofol is usually administered in hospital settings as a short-acting but powerful anesthetic.

Outside the court, defense attorney Ed Chernoff told reporters that "Dr. Murray is looking forward to the opportunity to finally tell his side of the story." However, he said the doctor's lawyers hadn't decided whether Dr. Murray would testify in his own defense.

The judge suspended Dr. Murray's medical license in California. Dr. Murray also has a license to practice medicine in Texas and Nevada.

If convicted, Dr. Murray could face a maximum of four years in prison. He would also be banned from practicing medicine.

Judge Pastor scheduled the trial for March 28, starting with jury selection. The trial could last eight weeks.

Both sides are due in court on Feb. 7 for a hearing that will determine whether television cameras will be allowed at the trial. Dr. Murray isn't required to attend next month's hearing.
