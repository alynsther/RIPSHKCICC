NEW DELHI--India said it reacted with "grave concern" to news that al Qaeda leader  Osama bin Laden had been hiding out "deep inside" Pakistan before his death Monday, and called on Islamabad to arrest militants connected to the attacks on Mumbai in 2008 that killed more than 160 people.

"We believe the perpetrators of the Mumbai terror attack, including the controllers and handlers of the terrorists who actually carried out the attack, continue to be sheltered in Pakistan," the Home Ministry said in a statement.

"We once again call on the government of Pakistan to arrest the persons whose names have been handed over to the interior minister of Pakistan," the statement said.

A spokesman for Pakistan's President  Asif Ali Zardari declined to comment.

Mr. bin Laden was killed overnight Monday in a joint U.S.-Pakistan operation on a compound near the Pakistani town of Abbottabad.

The Mumbai attacks were carried out by 10 Pakistani gunmen over three days in November 2008. Pakistan has charged seven men linked to Pakistan militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba in connection with the attack but their trials are yet to get underway.

India last year sentenced the lone surviving gunmen to death but the sentence has not yet been carried out. 

New Delhi says it has given Pakistan information regarding the involvement of other senior militants. India previously has criticized Pakistan for failing to act on this information and for moving too slowly with its trials.
