To raise the large sums of money necessary for a presidential campaign, candidates turn to fund-raisers who tap into donor networks. These fund-raising "bundlers" emerged as a result of the post-Watergate election law limiting how much a person can contribute to a political candidate.

In the 2012 presidential election, individuals can donate no more than $2,500 to a candidate for the primary, and $2,500 for the general election.

But individuals can raise much larger amounts for a candidate by recruiting donations from family members, friends, colleagues and other associates.

These donations are then "bundled" together and contributed to the presidential hopeful. There are no limits on how much an individual can bundle for a candidate.

There also are no rules requiring candidates to disclose how much of their money comes in the form of such contributions. However, in his 2000 presidential campaign, George Bush established a precedent of voluntarily disclosing the identities of his top bundlers, as well as how much they raised.

In the 2008 campaign, bundlers for Democratic nominee Barack Obama raised $77 million and bundlers for GOP nominee John McCain raised $76 million, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.

Many bundlers come from Wall Street and Hollywood. Because bundlers account for a lot of money raised by presidential campaigns, candidates spend considerable time courting them before deciding on a presidential bid.
