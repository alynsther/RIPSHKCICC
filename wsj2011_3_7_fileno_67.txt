These days, more than a tree is growing in Brooklyn. A month-long installation at the Brooklyn Museum, completed on Friday, has sprouted a whimsical fabric forest in the facility's newly renovated, 10,000 square-foot Great Hall. 'reOrder,' by the Brooklyn-based Situ Studio, transforms the space into a grove of billowing canopies that resemble Dr. Seuss-like trees and mushrooms.

To get an idea of how Situ created the installation, we asked the designers to tabulate some of the materials they used to augment the room's 16 floor-to-ceiling columns—such as the 2,200 yards of fabric needed to create the canopies. Beneath each one, visitors can rest on benches created from interlocking milled plywood shapes (think jigsaw puzzle) and covered with a hard plastic that was heated and molded to cover each bench section. Thanks to lights that illuminate the canopies from within, the fabric softly glows and engages in an exchange with the hall's skylights. 

The whole space feels clean—and a bit ghostly. "We're constantly surprised how the space is used," said Bradley Samuels, one of the project's designers. "We don't try to project the quality of the experience … what happens in the space beyond [the program] is yet to be seen."
