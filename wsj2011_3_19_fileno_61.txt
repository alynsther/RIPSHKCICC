Roberta's, off the Morgan Avenue stop on the L line, has been known to draw island snobs sui generis (see Vogue's  Jeffrey Steingarten) to Bushwick for the pizza alone.

Weekend brunch is also worth the trip—and the inevitable wait—at the Italian-leaning spot. The menu includes homey breakfast and lunch dishes (bacon, egg and cheese on a buttermilk biscuit, $6; pork belly over polenta with poached egg and pecorino, $13), plus a short list of pizzas, wood-fired in the bright-red oven at the front of the restaurant. Try the M. Martigan (pesto, mozzarella, artichokes, mushrooms, $13).

On your way out, pick up a loaf of bread ($3 to $6) baked by  Melissa Weller, formerly of Per Se and Bouchon Bakery.

The pizzas as well as the regular menu items change based on what's seasonally, said general manager  Vanessa Rimando. 

Come warm weather, the restaurant will source ingredients from Brooklyn Grange, a one-acre rooftop farm in which Roberta's owners are also partners.

 Roberta's, 261 Moore St. at Bogart St.; (718)  417-1118. Brunch is served Saturday and Sunday, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
