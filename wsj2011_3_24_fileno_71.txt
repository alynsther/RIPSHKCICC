'This is not about Ed Koch. This has nothing to do with Ed Koch. This is all about pride. Pride in our borough. Pride in our bridge.' — Council Member Peter Vallone, of Astoria, explaining his opposition to the renaming. He argued that the move was a slight to Queens and that no one would ever try to rename the Brooklyn Bridge. 

'It's a bridge with an identity crisis.' — Council Member Mark Weprin, of Queens

'We in Brooklyn have sold that bridge so many times we're just not sure who owns it at this point.' — Council Member David Greenfield, of Brooklyn, explaining to Mr. Vallone why the Brooklyn Bridge couldn't be renamed 

'The whole notion that the status of Queens, the fortune of Queens, the good name of Queens is going to rise and fall on the fortunes of this bridge sells Queens short.' — James Gennaro, Democrat of Queens, a supporter of the renaming.

'For blacks and Latinos, Ed Koch was our nemesis….This is a disgrace to have a bridge named after Ed Koch. Ya'll got to be kidding.' — Council Member Charles Barron, of Brooklyn. He suggested that Rikers Island be named for Mr. Koch instead. 

'Save your material for Rudy Giuliani Turnpike when I introduce it.' — Council Republican Leader James Oddo, in response to Mr. Barron

Mr. Koch on what he'll tell cabbies when he goes to Astoria: 'I'll say, take the Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge, please.'

'So long as I'm alive, if anybody suggests fares at that bridge, I will stand there like Horatio and stop it…No tolls on the Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge because you'll find me standing there with my sword.'  — Mr. Koch
