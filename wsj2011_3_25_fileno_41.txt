As the Executive VP of Acquisitions & Production for Sony Pictures Classics,  Dylan Leiner has spent his career traveling to Cannes, Milan and other international film festivals looking for material to acquire. For roughly 15 years, he's also been a member of an informal floating soccer game, first put together by "The Departed" producer and GK Films'  Graham King, Icon UK's Stewart Till and producer  Peter Wetherell, that's popped up among other industry players between screenings and deal-making sessions abroad.

Inspired by his adventures on the pitch, Mr. Leiner and filmmaker friend and CinemaCapital founder  Jeffrey Saunders decided to take the idea of soccer-mad film professionals and celebrities playing a game and add a charity element. The result is NYFEST, a Tribeca Film Festival-aligned day of soccer events including a youth showcase, a five-on-five industry match—including teams from the Creative Artists Agency, "The Daily Show" and Focus Features—as well as a celebrity game, with the likes of  Ethan Hawke and  Gael Garcia Bernal. Soccer legend Pele, who responded to a personal request to participate from Tribeca Film Festival co-founder  Robert De Niro, will call the coin toss. 

In addition to letting film professionals show off their footwork, the event "allows our industry to serve as a conduit for good works," said Mr. Leiner. "The charity aspect opened a lot of doors for us because at the end of the day, the event is to highlight and support the underserved youth of New York City." 

The first NYFEST will be April 23 at  Hudson River Park's Pier 40 in Tribeca, with all proceeds going to the Claudio Reyna Foundation and other select charities.
