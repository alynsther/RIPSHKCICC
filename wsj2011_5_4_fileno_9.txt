NEW YORKâ€” BP PLC service-station franchisees are seeking damages from the parent company for manipulation of gasoline prices and other complaints, in separate lawsuits filed in U.S. federal and California state courts. 

In the federal lawsuit, filed last week, the service-station owners alleged BP manipulated gasoline-delivery schedules to charge more for supplies. 

Additionally, franchisees alleged they were forced to accept an exclusive vendor contract for automated sales-tracking software that malfunctioned. BP knew about the problems and refused to allow alternate software to be used, franchisees claimed, causing them to lose business. 

The franchisees filed with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California and requested a jury trial and unspecified damages. 

Separately, a second group of franchisees filed a similar lawsuit Wednesday in California State Superior Court for the County of Los Angeles, requesting at least $200 million in damages. That complaint didn't include allegations of wholesale-price manipulation. 

A spokesman for BP declined to comment on the pending litigation.
