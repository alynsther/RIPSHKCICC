 and Chrysler Group LLC were placed twelfth and thirteenth out of 13 auto makers ranked in the April issue of the magazine.

Among other auto makers,  Toyota Motor Corp. managed to keep its scores near the top of the rankings, despite the recall and quality troubles it has suffered in the past year. European car companies including  BMW AG and  Daimler AG's Mercedes-Benz performed well in comfort and overall ride but lost points due to weak ratings for reliability, Consumer Reports said.

Honda had the top overall score of 74, and was followed by Subaru, Toyota and Volvo. Ford placed fifth with an overall score of 67.  Hyundai Motor Co., Mazda Motors,  Nissan Motor Co.,  Volkswagen AG and Mercedes rounded out the top 10.

The score card takes into account a variety of factors as measured by Consumer Reports, including on-road performance, reliability and fuel-economy.

Honda got a boost in its scores from the Fit subcompact, which was named the "best value" among small cars and the "best budget car." Ford's Mustang and  Kia Motor Co.'s Sorento were among six new models added to the magazine's annual list of best picks.
