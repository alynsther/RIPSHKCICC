The Islanders removed the interim tag from head coach Jack Capuano on Tuesday after he guided a young team out of the basement following his November hiring. Capuano took over for Scott Gordon, who was fired after a 4-10-3 start to the season. Capuano led the Islanders to a 26-29-10 record and a 15-12-6 record after the All-Star break. Previously, Capuano coached the Islanders' AHL affiliate, the Bridgeport Sound Tigers.

Call it a sign of optimism. One month into its lockout, the NFL on Tuesday announced its preseason schedule. After playing five prime-time regular-season games last year, the Jets will open this preseason back on that national stage with a Monday night game on August 15 against the Texans in Houston.

The rest of their preseason slate will be at home at the New Meadowlands Stadium. They host Cincinnati during the preseason's second weekend (Aug. 18-22), play "at" their stadium-mate Giants the third weekend (Aug. 25-28) and host Philadelphia Sept. 1 or 2. 

The Giants, meanwhile, will have a Monday night preseason date as well, on Aug. 22 at home against the Chicago Bears. The week before, they'll open the preseason at the Carolina Panthers. They'll host the Jets in the third week and close at the New England Patriots. Exact dates and times will all be announced, if, of course, there is a 2011 season.
