WASHINGTONâ€”The federal government in February ran its biggest one-month deficit in U.S. history, a development that could fuel the intensifying debate on Capitol Hill about government spending. 

The federal government reported a $222.5 billion deficit last month as it spent $333.2 billion but brought in $110.7 billion in revenue, the Treasury Department said. The second-highest deficit in U.S. history was $220.9 billion in February 2010.

The data come as Congress and the White House are locked in a debate over the size of spending cuts as part of bill to fund the government for the next seven months. Republicans are pushing for close to $60 billion in cuts, while White House officials say they want a lower number. A current bill to fund the government expires March 18, and there could be a partial government shut down if a deal isn't reached by then.

The government usually runs a deficit in February; it has to pay out income-tax refunds while having just 28 days to collect revenues, fewer days than in a typical month. Deficits tend to run much lower in the months of January, March, and April.

February's red ink, which marked the nation's 29th consecutive monthly shortfall, raised the budget deficit so far for fiscal 2011 to $641.26 billion. The Obama administration has projected the country will run a $1.65 trillion deficit in 2011, the largest in U.S. history. In 2010, the deficit was $1.29 trillion. The country has $14.1 trillion in debt, and Treasury officials are pushing lawmakers to raise the $14.3 trillion debt ceiling by next month.

Treasury reported that in February the government paid $19.1 billion in interest on its debt. 

The government collected $869.0 in the first five months of 2011, compared to $800.5 billion in the same period a year earlier. The government spent $1.51 trillion in the first five months of fiscal 2011, compared to $1.45 trillion in the same time a year earlier.
