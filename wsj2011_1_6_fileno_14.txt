A 16-year-old Bronx student was stabbed and critically wounded outside his high school Wednesday morning, authorities said.

Police were investigating if the teenager was involved in an argument between two groups of students shortly before 9 a.m. outside the Lewis and Clark School in the Tremont section of the Bronx, officials said. He was stabbed in the neck and taken by ambulance to Jacobi Medical Center where he was listed in critical condition and undergoing surgery, authorities said.

He was identified as  Negro Rivera and is a tenth-grader at Lewis and Clark.

A pair of small surgical scissors, with its handles wrapped in a gauze material, were recovered near the Tratman Avenue school, which serves students with learning disabilities, police said. Detectives were trying to determine if the scissors were used in the assault, police said.

Authorities were also looking into witness statements that the injured student had been fighting with a group of teenagers from nearby Lehman High School for several days over a girl, a law-enforcement official with knowledge of the case said.

Classmates of the victim said the feud escalated Wednesday and erupted in violence.
