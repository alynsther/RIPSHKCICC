It's time for Sunday Journal's 43rd Investment Dartboard contest.

Choose one stock from the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq market you think will perform well between April 1 and Sept. 30. We'll then select six reader entries to compete against each other and a portfolio chosen by throwing darts at stock listings. We'll also ask a Sunday Journal contributor to make his or her own picks.

The reader whose stock performs best during the six months wins a Sunday Journal tote bag and, more important, lifetime bragging rights.

Send your pick by March 28 to sundaydartboard@wsj.com. Include your name, address, daytime phone number and the name of the newspaper where you read Sunday Journal. Investment professionals and previous contestants can't compete.
