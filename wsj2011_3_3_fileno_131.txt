Fresh from a remarkable victory at the WGC Accenture Match Play last week, Luke Donald will be center of attention when he returns to stroke play at the Honda Classic in Palm Beach, Fla.

The new world No. 3 won this event in 2006 and lost by one shot to Ernie Els on his last visit here in 2008, but gamblers shouldn't underestimate the toll that six rounds of match-play golf will have taken on him: Donald is available at around 15/1 on Betdaq. 

Past leaderboards show that longer-priced selections have performed well on the PGA National Golf Club Champion course: YE Yang won as a 200/1-shot here in 2009, as did Mark Wilson two years earlier, which means it's tempting to look down the list for value.

Yang himself is coming into good form, reaching the quarterfinals last week and posting a top-10 finish at the Phoenix Open. He should relish a return to Palm Beach Gardens and is a good each-way call at 40/1.

Sweden's Fredrik Jacobson has been remarkably consistent over the PGA National for the last two years. A missed cut at the Phoenix Open is his only poor result this year and while he may struggle to better his last two finishes of sixth and tied-fifth in the Honda Classic, selling his finishing position at 42 with Sporting Index is recommended.

Graeme McDowell started well with a 68-67 here last year before suffering on the Sunday. Back him to beat his Northern Irish compatriot Rory McIlroy at 10/11 in a 72-hole match bet with Victor Chandler.
