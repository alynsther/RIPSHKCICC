The West Coast's largest oil refiners weren't affected by the tsunami resulting from a major earthquake in Japan, but they are closely watching the situation.

 said the tsunami didn't have any impact on their operations in the region. 

"We are monitoring the reports but have not altered production at our California refineries," Valero spokesman  Bill Day said. 

A magnitude 8.9 earthquake hit northeast Japan early Friday morning Pacific time. The tsunami swamped Hawaii's beaches and damaged harbors in California. 

Tesoro said in a news release there was no impact to operations at its 93,500-barrel-a-day refinery in Hawaii and 72,000-barrel-a-day refinery in Alaska. A few low-lying retail gas stations in Hawaii were evacuated as a precaution. 

Tesoro, along with Valero, the U.S.'s largest independent refinery, and integrated oil giant Chevron said they are taking precautions to secure their facilities. 

Valero operates a 170,000-barrel-a-day refinery near the San Francisco Bay area and a 135,000-barrel-a-day refinery in the Los Angeles area. The independent refinery doesn't expect these plants to be affected by the tsunami because they are further inland, Mr. Day said. 

Chevron operates a 265,500-barrel-a-day refinery in El Segundo, also near Los Angeles, and 245,000-barrel-a-day refinery in Richmond, near San Francisco. 

Chevron hasn't experienced any damages at its facilities because of the tsunami and "we continue to supply products to the market without interruption," spokesman  Sean Comey said in an email. 

BP and Shell said all of their West Coast operations are normal. BP owns 265,000-barrel-a-day refinery in the Los Angeles area, among other assets, while Shell has a 156,400-barrel-a-day plant in Martinez.

Exxon has taken precautions to secure its 149,500-barrel-a-day Torrance, Calif., refinery. The company had curtailed refining operations in Japan because of the earthquake.

 which also has refineries along the West Coast, couldn't be reached for comment. 

Once weather conditions ease, the West Coast refineries could see greater export demand for fuel products in Japan where nuclear plants have had to be shut down for safety reasons. While Japan could import more oil products to produce electricity, there is "going to be an element of demand destruction because a lot of people are being displaced," said RBC Capital analyst  Jacques Rousseau. 

Valero's Mr. Day said, "It's too early to say, but that will depend not only on the impact to Japan's economy but also potential damage to the country's refining and distribution assets."
