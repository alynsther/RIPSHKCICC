 A Washington state health-care committee voted to restrict coverage of continuous glucose monitoring of patients to those who have had a past episode of low blood sugar or are enrolled in a trial. A Saturday U.S. News article about the committee's vote incorrectly implied that coverage to all patients was voted down. In addition, the surname of Irl Hirsch, a professor of medicine at the University of Washington School of Medicine, was misspelled as Hirsh.

 Baseball's Oakland A's have won the World Series four times. An article in some editions Thursday incorrectly implied that the San Francisco Giants' World Series victory last year was the first for the Bay Area.
