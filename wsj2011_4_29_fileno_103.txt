An upscale Long Island suburb voted against a plan to demolish a 128-year-old architectural gem that has sat unused for decades.

That means St. Paul's School, a former boarding school, is safeâ€”for now. But while voters in Garden City, N.Y., made clear their overwhelming opposition to tearing down the village-owned building, local officials are still no closer to figuring out how to use it.

Residents were asked to cast ballots in a referendum to float bonds for up $3.75 million that would pay for demolishing. There were 3,290 votes against demolition and 1,120 in favor, said village clerk  Brian Ridgway, a sizable turnout for an area with about 17,000 registered voters.

Garden City has never been able to agree on how to use the architecturally significant building since the village purchased the 48-acre site for $7.25 million in 1993. "We've been trying for...years to do all sorts of things with the building," Ridgway said.Some resident want to use St. Paul's as community space, while others think spending taxpayer dollars on upkeep isn't a smart use of public funds. Mr. Ridgway estimates the building would cost between $35 million and $45 million to restore.

Over the decades of indecision, the building has silently crumbled.

He declined to ponder the saga's next chapter Thursday afternoon: The vote, he said, "just needs to be digested by the board of trustees and then they'll move forward."

  Maureen Traxler, a spokeswoman for the Committee to Save St. Paul's, considered the outcome "wonderful news." As for the ornate building's future: "I'm hoping they will not think of demolishing it anymore and go in a better direction."
