Alex Ovechkin scored nearly two minutes into overtime after Brooks Laich tied the game with less than a minute left in regulation, and the Washington Capitals beat the New York Islanders on Tuesday night.

Ovechkin picked up a loose puck near the boards and then beat goalie Nathan Lawson with a backhand shot.

Lawson made 40 saves and kept the Capitals at bay until Laich scored to force overtime. Laich redirected a pass from recently acquired Jason Arnott into the net.
