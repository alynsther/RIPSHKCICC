ISTANBUL—The U.S. and other global powers agreed on Friday to hold a second consecutive day of talks with Iran on its nuclear program, after the diplomatic track came close to collapse, said Western officials briefed on the deliberations.

Tehran had originally refused to discuss United Nations Security Council demands that the Middle East country suspend its nuclear program.

Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, Saeed Jalili, also set preconditions for any future dialogue, said these officials.

One condition called for the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and Germany to recognize Iran's right to develop the technologies required to produce nuclear fuel. The other involved the U.S. and its partners beginning to ease financial sanctions imposed on Iran in recent years for its nuclear work.

"We were clear and united in telling Iran that the process could only go forward if they showed a genuine commitment to the dialogue," said a Western official involved in the talks. The official added that Mr. Jalili was told there would be "repercussions" if he failed to engage, without specifying them.

Catherine Ashton, the European Union's foreign policy chief, headed the diplomatic bloc that included the U.S., Russia, China, the U.K., France and Germany. Washington was represented by the State Department's No. 3 diplomat, William Burns.

The Western official said the parties still remained far apart on the terms of any sustained dialogue. But the diplomat said Ms. Ashton felt there was an opening to at least get Iran to remove its preconditions for more substantive talks.

The Obama administration has repeatedly stated it will impose additional economic sanctions on Tehran if it doesn't cease enriching uranium and its nuclear-fuel production site in central Iran.
