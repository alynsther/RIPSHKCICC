Martin Brodeur and the suddenly revived New Jersey Devils took advantage of the absence of Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin to shut out the Pittsburgh Penguins on Thursday night in Newark.

Mr. Brodeur had a a relatively easy night, stopping 23 shots in posting his fourth shutout of the season and the NHL regular-season record 114th of his career.

Brian Rolston and rookie Nick Palmieri scored for the Devils, who have points in a season-high five straight games (4-0-1).
