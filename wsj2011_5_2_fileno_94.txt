Many NFL fans who watched their teams pick players late in this weekend's draft surely hoped for—and expected—the next Tom Brady. The thinking goes that because the Patriots quarterback was passed on 198 times in 2000, any late pick could be a future star. But it turns out that Brady is the exception—greats hardly ever slip through the cracks.

Of the 67 players in the Pro Football Hall of Fame who made their debut since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger, only five were taken with the equivalent of a 2011 last-day pick. Tops is former Bear Richard Dent, who terrorized quarterbacks for more than a decade. Tight end Shannon Sharpe and center Mike Webster are next, although they'll certainly drop down to Nos. 3 and 4 once Brady's bust is sculpted in Canton. Receiver Steve Largent, No. 4 on the list, lasted until pick No. 117 in 1976 and was soon traded for an eighth-round pick.

Actually, you have as good a chance of finding that future Hall of Famer by picking through undrafted free agents. Likely future inductee Kurt Warner went unclaimed in 1994. Center Jim Langer (1970), quarterback Warren Moon (1977) and defensive lineman John Randle (1990), all Hall of Famers, also were bypassed completely.

If you set the bar lower and look at more recent years, the odds of finding that winning lottery ticket get no better. Just two players who started at least three Pro Bowls since 2000 were drafted with pick 120 or later, with Jay Ratliff, picked No. 224 by the Cowboys in 2005, the biggest bargain.

Here are latest-picked Hall of Famers who made their debuts since 1970.
