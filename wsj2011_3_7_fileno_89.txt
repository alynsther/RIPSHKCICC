When Evan Longoria signed a nine-year contract six games into his big-league career, the Tampa Bay Rays took on the biggest commitment ever made to an unproven prospect. Three years later, Longoria's contract has become the most favorable in the game.

The third baseman has racked up 19.6 Wins Above Replacement in his first three seasons, which is third-most among position players in that span, behind Cardinal Albert Pujols and the Phillies' Chase Utley. While Longoria would have made close to the league minimum for the three seasons, the deal means his next six project as a monumental bargain.

Take the Phillies' slugging first baseman Ryan Howard. Starting with his first arbitration-eligible year, which is where Longoria is now, Howard will earn a combined $104 million over those six seasons. Even if Longoria maxed out all of his bonuses in the next six years, he'd make about $46 million.

Longoria had good reason to sign when he did. A study by Scott McKinney of Royals Review shows that even top-10 prospects like Longoria become major-league busts 37% of the time. Still, there was the risk of leaving money on the table.

"I told him what it would look like in the media if he signed the deal and became a star," Longoria's agent, Paul Cohen, said he told him at the time. "I told him, if media perception was important, don't do it."
