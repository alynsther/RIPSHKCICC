MUMBAI â€“ Indian shares ended higher for a third straight session Tuesday with the benchmark index recording its biggest points gain in 2011, buoyed by auto stocks which rose on robust February vehicle sales and tracking strong regional markets. 

The Bombay Stock Exchange's Sensitive Index rose 623.10 points, or 3.5%, to close at 18446.50, its highest close since Feb. 17. The index had gained 1.1% in the previous two sessions. 

On the National Stock Exchange, the 50-stock S&P CNX Nifty rose 189.05 points, or 3.5%, to end at 5522.30. 

Trading volume on the BSE declined to 33.75 billion rupees ($745 million) from Monday's 40.61 billion rupees. Gainers outnumbered decliners 2,128 to 759, while 81 stocks were unchanged. 

"Buying from foreign institutional investors as well as short-covering in large-cap stocks boosted markets. It appears the market now believes the government's fiscal deficit estimates," said  Vikas Khemani, head of institutional equities at Edelweiss Capital Ltd. 

Finance Minister  Pranab Mukherjee, in his budget speech before parliament Monday, said the fiscal deficit is expected to narrow to 4.6% of gross domestic product in the fiscal year starting April 1 from 5.1% in the current financial year. 

The benchmark had gained 3.4% Monday after the finance minister announced the fiscal deficit target, but had given up most of the gains due to profit-taking and concerns whether the government would be able to meet its aim. 

Mr. Khemani said he expects the markets to stabilize around current levels in coming sessions following Tuesday's sharp gains. 

Indian markets are closed Wednesday for a religious holiday. 

The benchmark has lost 13% in the first two months of 2011 due to foreign fund selling on concerns of higher inflation and rising interest rates. 

Most regional markets ended up Tuesday, with shares in Shanghai and Hong Kong advancing after two surveys showed China's manufacturing activity continued to expand in February, albeit at a smaller pace. 

Japan's Nikkei Stock Average advanced 1.2%, Taiwan's Taiex finished 1.5% higher, China's Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.5% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index gained 0.3%. 

On the BSE, all the 30 Sensex constituents and 13 sector indexes ended higher. 

The 11-stock BSE Auto index gained 5.6% to close at 8,718.22 after robust vehicle sales in February boosted investor sentiment in auto stocks which were already buoyant after a much-feared increased in excise taxes on cars didn't come through in the budget. 

"February sales are higher than January for the players who have reported so far, even though February is typically a slow month," said  Surjit Arora, an analyst at brokerage firm Prabhudas Lilladher. 

Tractor and utility vehicles maker Mahindra & Mahindra jumped 8.4% to 665.45 rupees, Maruti Suzuki India gained 7.1% to 1,292.90 rupees and  Tata Motors ended 5.4% up at 1,140.40 rupees.

Banks ended higher on hopes a lower-than-expected borrowing program by the government will push down short-term borrowing rates for banks. 

In his budget speech, the finance minister said the government would borrow a net 3.43 trillion rupees in the next fiscal year. The forecast in a poll of 15 economists was 3.96 trillion rupees.

ICICI Bank rose 5.7% to 1,025.95 rupees and  HDFC Bank gained 4.2% to 2,136.30 rupees, while State Bank of India ended 2.9% up at 2,706.90 rupees.
