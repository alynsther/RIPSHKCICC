NEW DELHI --The first meeting of an Indian ministerial panel, formed to take a view on approving Cairn Energy PLC's proposal to sell a majority stake in its Indian unit to London-based miner Vedanta Resources PLC, has been postponed, a government official said Monday. 

The meeting was scheduled to take place this evening. 

The official, who didn't wish to be named, didn't give any reasons for the postponement or a new date for the meeting. 

The panel is headed by Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee and also comprises Oil Minister Jaipal Reddy, Telecommunications Minister Kapil Sibal, Law Minister Veerappa Moily and Planning Commission Deputy Chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia. 

In August, Vedanta offered to buy up to a 60% stake in Cairn India Ltd. in a deal expected to cost as much as $9.6 billion. But, the process has been delayed as India hasn't yet given its clearance for the transaction.
