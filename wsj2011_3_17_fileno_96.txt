The Dow Jones Industrial Average posted a second consecutive triple-digit decline amid worries that the nuclear crisis in Japan could worsen.

The Dow industrials, down as much as 300 points at one point, finished 242.12 points lower, or 2.04%, at 11613.30, while the S&P 500-stock index ended down 24.99, or 1.95%, at 1256.88. The Nasdaq Composite fell 50.51, or 1.89%, to 2616.82. 

The stock market's swoon briefly dragged the Dow industrials and the S&P 500 into negative territory for the year; the Nasdaq Composite Index is now down 1.4% for the year so far. 

In the mounting crisis, the Pentagon said it ordered U.S. military personnel to stay at least 50 miles from a crippled Japanese nuclear plant, while the U.S. nuclear chief said radiation levels were "extremely high" at one of the reactors and recommended evacuations within a "much larger radius" than Japan's government has called for.

Stocks staged large swings on seemingly every comment and warning from top officials, underlining the deep current of anxiety among investors.

"There's just a complete vacuum here in terms of credible information on the status of the nuclear situation in Japan,"  Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors said. "Japan trumps everything for everyone right now [and] every investment decision is made through the prism of what is going on in Japan."

 said it was close to completing a new power line that could restore electricity to the damaged Fukushima Daiichi complex and possibly avert a meltdown, according to news reports, helping stocks recover some losses.

The losses started to pile up late morning after the European Union's commissioner for energy said that one of Japan's nuclear plants is "effectively out of control," and that the situation could continue to deteriorate.

Volume was robust, with about 5.2 billion shares changing hands in late afternoon New York Stock Exchange composite volume. The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, or VIX, soared as much as 29% intraday in a sign of the market's anxieties. 

In the U.S., data on housing starts showed the steepest monthly drop in nearly 27 years and new building permits set a record low, an indication that the battered sector continues to be a source of weakness for the economy. But the crisis in Japan, plus renewed tensions in the Middle East, set the tone of trading.

"Everyone's nervous about Japan," said Dave Rovelli, managing director of U.S. equity trading at Canaccord Genuity. "There's concerns about a complete nuclear meltdown. Now it's starting to look like a panic situation." 

In the Middle East, Bahraini security forces carried out a violent crackdown against protesters to drive them from the center of the capital Manama, imposing a curfew across much of the city, as the island kingdom attempted to end weeks of demonstrations.
