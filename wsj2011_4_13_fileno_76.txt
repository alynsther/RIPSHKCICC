As if Tottenham didn't have enough to contend with in Wednesday's Champions League quarterfinal against Real Madrid—the 4-0 first-leg deficit, the suspension of leading scorer Peter Crouch, the injury to veteran defender Vedran Corluka—it turns out the omens aren't too good either.

Spurs have never beaten a Spanish side at White Hart Lane in four previous attempts, which no doubt helps to explain why Madrid is as short as 1/500 with some oddsmakers to reach the semifinals.

Tottenham can take some confidence from Saturday's Premier League win at home to Stoke and star player Gareth Bale, who is 12/1 to score first here, should be fit to play after shaking off an ankle injury.

Still, there is little incentive to take the 9/5 with William Hill for Tottenham to win Wednesday's second leg. With a four-goal lead, head coach José Mourinho will likely instruct his team to protect its lead. 

Tottenham will need to score early to have any chance, but it's worth buying the time of the first goal with Sporting Index at 35 minutes or more. Spurs have only scored once in their past three European games and face a defense which has conceded just three times in nine Champions League matches. 

The other remaining quarter-final is almost as one-sided, with Inter on offer at 24/1 with Unibet to eliminate Schalke. The German team's 5-2 victory at San Siro gives it a huge advantage and Schalke looks a decent bet to win Wednesday's game outright at 17/10 having won all four of its previous home matches in this competition.
