DETROITâ€”Federal prosecutors charged five U.S. Postal Service supervisors in Michigan and Ohio with taking bribes in the form of cash, cars, drinks and lap dances in return for steering $13 million worth of vehicle-maintenance work to a private contractor.

The employees worked at offices around metro Detroit, and Akron, Ohio, between 2004 and 2010 when the alleged bribery scheme took place, according to federal officials who released the indictment Thursday.

Court papers don't name the accused contractor, and the U.S. Attorney's Office for Eastern Michigan didn't immediately return an inquiry seeking comment. The defendants were due for their first court appearance on Thursday.

One acting manager of a postal-vehicle facility in Detroit accepted thousands of dollars in drinks and lap dances at a local strip club, more than $8,000 in free work done on a relative's truck, and a $3,000 paver patio installed in the manager's backyard, prosecutors allege. In addition, on a weekly basis, the postal supervisor used the services of a prostitute paid for by the private contractor, according to federal law-enforcement officials.

Others involved in the bribery ring accepted cash bribes, gift cards, sports tickets, used cars and thousands of dollars in free car parts and service. One supervisor received a $40,000 loan to buy a condominium.

If convicted, each defendant faces a maximum of five years in prison for conspiring to commit bribery while several other defendants face a maximum of 15 years on several related counts. The indictments also seek forfeiture from the defendants of the illegal payments.
