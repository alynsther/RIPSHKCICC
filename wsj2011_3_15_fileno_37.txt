 and Italian carrier Alitalia to join their transatlantic joint venture, a senior executive at India's largest carrier by market share said recently. 

"We are still studying the feasibility of joining such a venture," the executive, who didn't want to be named, said. "There is no final decision yet." 

The executive said Jet Airways will need to consider its current partnerships with other airlines worldwide before arriving at any decision on joining the venture. 

The venture between the four airlines will likely include operational partnerships such as code-sharing on airline tickets, cooperation on client reward programs as well as other services such as engineering on some overseas routes, the Jet Airways executive said. 

Joining such an alliance would likely help Jet Airways to cost-effectively expand its overseas operations, leveraging the global network of the three other airlines instead of deploying its own aircraft. 

It would also pave the way for the Mumbai-based airline to enter the SkyTeam Alliance—a 13-member global airline group led by Delta and Air France-KLM. A SkyTeam representative declined comment.

National carrier Air India Ltd. plans to join Frankfurt-based Star Alliance, the biggest airline group in the world, while Kingfisher Airlines Ltd. will soon join the Oneworld alliance. 

Jet Airways, with its two units JetLite and Jet Airways Konnect, has a fleet of 116 planes from  Boeing Co.
