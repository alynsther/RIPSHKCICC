 declared a 38% fall in its fiscal third-quarter net profit as new regulations in the state of Andhra Pradesh reduced loan recoveries, resulting in more bad loans and higher provisions.

The microfinance industry, which usually lends less than $200 to people who use the money to start or expand small businesses, has been hit by laws enacted in Andhra Pradesh that cap lending rates, prevent coercive recovery practices and move the weekly recovery cycle to a monthly one. 

The state laws also mandate that not more than two lenders can give a loan to a single borrower at the same time.

Andhra Pradesh, the fourth-largest state by area in India with a high rate of poverty, is where most microlenders are headquartered. 

The issue gained political prominence after a string of borrower suicides amid allegations of strong-arm recovery tactics and of multiple lenders giving loans to the same borrower pushing them into debt traps. 

Net profit for the October-December period fell to 341.5 million rupees ($7.5 million) from 554.5 million rupees, the company said in an exchange filing Monday. 

Quarterly revenue rose 45% to 3.63 billion rupees from 2.5 billion rupees. 

Quarterly expenses more than doubled to 2.41 billion rupees from 1.07 billion rupees, mainly on provisions for bad loans rising to 1.01 billion rupees from 116.1 million rupees. 

The company said it had set aside 269.8 million rupees to meet provisioning requirements recommended in a recent central bank panel report. 

It has also set aside 587.4 million rupees against its loan book in the state of Andhra Pradesh, where the company has almost a third of its loan portfolio. 

Staff costs also rose more than 56% to 886.66 million rupees from 567.46 million rupees a year earlier. 

Interest and finance expenses rose 23% to 970.31 million rupees, but other income also helped the profitability, rising 54% to 47.93 million rupees from 31.12 million rupees.
