Rose Pistola in San Francisco's North Beach is counting on a face-lift and menu changes to win back the strong lunch business it once attracted.

When it opened 15 years ago, the restaurant's focus on cuisine from the Genoa region of northern Italy made with local ingredients set it apart from the older, traditional "red sauce" Italian places in the neighborhood. At lunchtime it was packed with businesspeople willing to make the 15-minute walk from the Financial District, as well as tourists and locals. 

Over the years, the business types stopped coming in the same numbers. "They just didn't have time to schlep all the way from the Financial District to North Beach," said owner Laurie Thomas. "People are more inclined now to run around the corner."

Cosmetic upgrades, a revised menu and longer lunch hours are all part of Ms. Thomas's effort to win that crowd back. In February, she completed renovations that included fresh paint, refinished woodwork and new lights. The fare now includes house-cured meats and more types of sandwiches. Other dishes include grilled octopus, roasted mussels and pizzas baked in a wood-fired oven. Prices range from $10 and higher for sandwiches to $27 for some seafood entrees. 

As an extra attraction for the office set, Rose Pistola now has free wireless Internet service, and Ms. Thomas doesn't mind if people linger. "Lunch can be either a long experience or a quick one," she said. 

Rose Pistola is located at 532 Columbus Ave. in San Francisco and serves lunch between 11:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. Monday through Friday.
