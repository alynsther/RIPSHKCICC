HONG KONGâ€” China Railway Construction Corp. said it has suspended all of its projects in Libya due to the unrest in the country. 

The Shanghai-and Hong Kong-listed contracting company said in a statement Tuesday that almost all of its employees that had been working in Libya have left the country, and the Chinese government is arranging the return of its remaining staff. 

"Given the uncertain situation in Libya, the preservation of equipment and materials on site and subsequent development remain unclear," China Railway Construction Chairman  Meng Fengchao said in the statement. 

China Railway Construction said it has three railway projects in Libya valued at a combined $4.24 billion.

The violence has disrupted much of China's presence in Libya, where Beijing has said there were some 75 Chinese companies operating and more than 30,000 Chinese residing before the unrest. On Tuesday, China's Foreign Ministry said about 32,000 Chinese nationals had been evacuated from Libya. It said China was nearly finished evacuation efforts in Libya's eastern and midwestern areas, and was working to extract some 3,000 Chinese in southern Libya. To assist the effort, China has dispatched military transport planes and a naval frigate, which arrived off the Libyan coast Tuesday.

China State Construction Engineering. Corp., China's leading off-shore construction outsourcing company, on Monday said it was suspending its projects in Libya amid the unrest, state media reported.
