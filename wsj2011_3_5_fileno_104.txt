The overwhelming majority of early Italian immigrants to America were poor peasants from southern Italy—places like Calabria and Sicily, where food was limited to bare essentials and kitchens had improved little since the Iron Age. Not surprisingly, early Italian-American food became a gradually more affluent version of this peasant fare, but simple, tomato-based spaghetti sauces remained dominant. The food was satisfying and affordable but no match for the classic French cuisine that ruled upmarket European and American restaurants from the 1860s through the first half of the 20th century. Then came the postwar era, when returning GIs and American tourists brought home from Europe an appreciation for real Italian food. Today in the United States, Italian restaurants— some good, some glitzy—far outnumber their French rivals.

Many of these establishments are zestfully described in "How Italian Food Conquered the World," an entertaining and fact-filled chronicle by Esquire magazine food-and-wine correspondent John F. Mariani. He offers a number of user-friendly recipes for Italian classics, including Bistecca alla Fiorentina (a minimalist Tuscan masterpiece of salt, pepper, olive oil and, of course, a prime T-bone steak). He also shares a few examples of over-the-top offerings from current trend-setting Italian chefs, such as Fortunato Nicotra, the chef at the New York restaurant Felidia. If God ever intended cornmeal mush, mozzarella and fish eggs to intermingle—which is far from certain—maestro Nicotra's delicately balanced recipe for polenta with Burrata cheese and caviar, with its hint of bay leaf and chives, is definitely the way to go.
