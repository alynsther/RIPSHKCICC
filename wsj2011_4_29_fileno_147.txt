For a week starting Tuesday, New York City Ballet is devoting its stage to a signature part of its repertory: the "black and white" ballets created by founding choreographer George Balanchine. The commonality between the 12 modernist works is in the costuming, which is entirely black or white leotards and tights.

The simple garments—similar to what dancers wear for practice—emphasize the body and movement. But some of the ballets didn't start out so simply. "A number of the ballets presented, such as 'Apollo,' 'The Four Temperaments' and 'Concerto Barocco', started out with very complicated scenic and costume design," said Ellen Sorrin, director of The George Balanchine Trust. "Balanchine at some point felt that he wanted the bodies to be the focal point."

While Balanchine did at times strip away costumes as he went along), he did create ballets from scratch with the black-andwhite motif in mind. For his 1972 "Stravinsky Violin Concerto," the female dancers wear black leotards and black tights with stirrups over their pointe shoes, a look that elongates the leg. 

Sometimes, there were practical reasons at hand. "There were always financial considerations," said Ms. Sorrin, explaining that the minimal costumes could balance out a costly production. 

While the look established his aesthetic, Balanchine's music choices further defined his work. Several are set to commissioned scores—most often by Igor Stravinsky—but he also used existing music by Bach, Vivaldi and Ravel. And while the black-and-white ballets typically don'ttell stories, the main exception is "Apollo," created in 1928, in which the god of music learns the arts from three muses. 

During "Balanchine Black & White Week," NYCB is hosting several free pre-performance talks that explore Balanchine's wide-ranging work, always tricky to carbon-date.

"We have to remember that Balanchine died 28 years ago," said Ms. Sorrin. "And because he was so cutting-edge, it's hard to know when these works were made."
