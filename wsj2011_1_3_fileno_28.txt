Global chip sales eased 0.9% in November, the second-straight month of declines, with sequential drops in all geographic regions except Europe, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. 

Chip sales have been mostly strong in recent months, with sales improving sequentially in the seven months up to October, when they also pulled back slightly. The industry outlook has been mixed amid slowing consumer demand and changing market dynamics owing to the increasing presence of smartphones and tablet computers. 

Chip sales were $26 billion in November, up 14% from a year earlier when the economy was pulling out of its slump. 

SIA President  Brian Toohey reiterated the group expects sales growth will continue to moderate, though the industry is on track to achieve record sales for 2010 despite economic uncertainty. 

Chip sales in the Americas saw the biggest year-to-year increase, at 21%, but were down 1.6% month-to-month. 

Sales increased 2.5% sequentially in Europe during November, with year-to-year growth of 13%. In the Asia Pacific region, which accounts for more than half of global chip sales, the tally fell 1.4% sequentially, but was up 14% on an annual basis.
