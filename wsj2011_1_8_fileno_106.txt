At first, the brunch menu at Cucharamama seems ordinary: eggs, home fries and slab bacon. It's the sauces, though, that give the dishes at this Hoboken restaurant their distinctive, South American flair.

"Everything begins with a cooking sauce," says chef and co-owner  Maricel Presilla, who is also a food historian. The sauces typically start with a base of onions and garlic, "and you add different spices according to the region."

The Andes are well represented by the flavors at Cucharamama. Diners can choose eggs blanketed in a spicy Andean pepper sauce ($12 with potatoes). The slab bacon ($17) is marinated with Andean peppers, then roasted. 

"We treat it like pork belly rather than bacon," Ms. Presilla said. The chicken and beef pot pie ($15) is a Chilean dish. Corn lends sweetness to the pie, but merkén—a "Chilean paprika" made from a blend of spices and hot peppers—adds a kick. 

On a recent frigid Sunday, the Venzuelan hot chocolate ($7), spiced with anise and cinnamon, was a good compromise for dessert.

Appetizers, many Peru-inspired, are also available at brunch. The octopus, in a sauce of Alfonso olives and panca peppers, is a Japanese-Peruvian creation and a nod to the culinary influence of Asian migrants to Peru.
