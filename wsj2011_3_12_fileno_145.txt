State-run Canara Bank on Wednesday launched an institutional share sale to raise up to 20 billion rupees, two people familiar with the matter said. 

 The shares will be priced around 604 rupees each, the people told Dow Jones Newswires, asking not to be named. 

JP Morgan India Pvt. Ltd., HSBC Securities & Capital Markets India Pvt. Ltd., SBI Capital Markets Ltd. and JM Financial Consultants Pvt. Ltd. are the managers on the share sale. 

 The fund raising will help the lender bolster its capital base to meet the rising credit needs of Asia's second-fastest growing major economy. 

 The capital adequacy ratio of the bank as of Dec. 31, 2010, stood at 13.02% with the Tier I capital ratio at 8.27%.
