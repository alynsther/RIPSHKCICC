Asian markets mostly slumped as rising oil prices fueled fears about inflation and economic growth, while Japanese and Indian stocks faced added pressure from political setbacks to the ruling governments.

Japan's Nikkei Stock Average tumbled 1.8% to 10505.02. South Korea's Kospi shed 1.2% to 1980.27. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 gave up 1.4% to 4797.88. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index shed 0.4% to 23313.19. Taiwan's Taiex fell 0.8% to 8713.79. India's Sensex sank 1.4% to 18222.67.

Chinese shares rose on the back of supportive economic policies, sending the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index up 1.8% to a fresh 2011 closing high.

"Oil markets are continuing to dictate direction of equity markets, with escalating tensions in Libya intensifying chatter of $200 a barrel. You only have to remember back to 2008, when outlandish numbers were being bandied around," said  Ben Potter, market strategist at IG Markets. "Given the still fragile state of the global economy, these comments look to be causing some fear in the market."

The declines in Tokyo were aggravated by political turmoil, with Foreign Minister Seiji Maehara—one of the country's more popular politicians—resigning Sunday over illegal political donations from a foreign national. The minister's departure further complicates Prime Minister Naoto Kan's nine-month grip on power, given that his Democratic Party-led government already faces gridlock in the opposition-controlled Upper House over budget-related bills.

"There is caution over the risk of a [further] downgrade in Japan's sovereign-debt rating if political uncertainty deepens," said  Hisatsune Kobayashi, a senior market analyst at Nikko Cordial Securities.

Shares tumbled in Mumbai after weekend media reports said the Dravida Munnettra Kazhagam—an ally of the federal government formed by a multi-party coalition—had withdrawn its support.

"With the political risks rising, we believe that the government machinery will be less inclined to take decisions, the direct impact of which will be on a lot of infrastructure projects that need green signals," analysts at Emkay Equity Advisory wrote in a note to clients. "In the short term, the market is likely to show weakness…weak economic data will now be fuelled by the new political development."

  HDFC Bank fell 2%, Reliance Communications shed 3.6%, and  Tata Motors declined 4.1%.

The advance in Shanghai came after China's annual legislative session rolled out several economic goals over the weekend, including a commitment to raise incomes and a call for companies to lift wages to match productivity increases. Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao maintained the country's economic growth target for 2011 at 8%, and he pledged that taming inflation will be the government's top economic policy priority this year.

"Supportive industrial policies in the government's work report released Saturday are helping to boost sentiment in the market," said  Li Xin, an analyst from China Development Bank Securities. However, he said he remains cautious amid concerns about further measures to tighten monetary policy.

Coal miners rose sharply on hopes prices will ride higher in tandem with oil prices. Gold miners advanced on the precious metal's price outlook.
