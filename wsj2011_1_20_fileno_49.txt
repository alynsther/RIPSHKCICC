The Knicks' woes continued Wednesday night, as they lost their fourth straight game in a poor showing in Houston. It is their longest losing streak since their six-game losing streak in early November. Amar'e Stoudemire scored 25 points and grabbed just five rebounds while the Knicks' second leading scorer, Raymond Felton, had 14 points. The Knicks were outscored in the paint 54 to 36. For the Rockets, six players were in double figures, including Kevin Martin, who had 21.
