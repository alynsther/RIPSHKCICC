Mumbai--Wockhardt Ltd said the Bombay High Court has granted interim relief to the company by staying the admission of a winding-up petition filed by some overseas bondholders. 

The court has also asked Wockhardt to deposit 1.15 billion rupees by May 3, the Indian drug maker said in a regulatory filing. The company has agreed to deposit the amount, it added. 

Debt-laden Wockhardt is locked in a tussle with some holders of its foreign currency convertible bonds over the terms of repayment of certain liabilities that the company failed to meet. 

Earlier this month, some bondholders, including an overseas unit of Indian rival Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd and QVT Advisors Pvt. Ltd, had filed a petition against the company in the Bombay High Court.
