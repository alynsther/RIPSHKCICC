, of wrongfully firing him because he wouldn't comply with what he says were illegal demands from his boss, Mr. Adelson.

The amended complaint, filed Wednesday in a Nevada court, also accuses Mr. Adelson and his companies of defamation after a statement from the casino boss was published in The Wall Street Journal following a ruling Tuesday rejecting Sands' request to dismiss the case.

Mr. Adelson, through his spokesman  Ron Reese, sent an email to The Wall Street Journal with his first comments to the media about the case: "While I have largely stayed silent on the matter to this point, the recycling of his allegations must be addressed," he said. "We have a substantial list of reasons why Steve Jacobs was fired for cause and interestingly he has not refuted a single one of them. Instead, he has attempted to explain his termination by using outright lies and fabrications which seem to have their origins in delusion."

Mr. Jacobs is seeking damages for what he calls the "false and defamatory" comments which he says were sent to a third party with the "express intent of republication to a worldwide audience."

Earlier, Las Vegas Sands said its Macau unit had filed a defamation complaint in the Chinese territory against Mr. Jacobs.

Neither Mr. Jacobs nor his lawyer,  Don Campbell, responded to requests for comment.
