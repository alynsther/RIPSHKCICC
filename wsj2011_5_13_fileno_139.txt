MUMBAI â€“ Indian shares rose Friday as a strong showing in state elections by the party leading the federal coalition boosted market sentiment, but they closed off intraday highs as investors used gains to book profits. 

The Bombay Stock Exchange's Sensitive Index rose 195.49 points, or 1.1%, to end at 18531.28--mostly unchanged from last Friday's close--after moving between 18280.70 and 18724.54. On the National Stock Exchange, the 50-stock S&P CNX Nifty added 58.60 points, or 1.1%, to end at 5544.75. 

Trading volume on the BSE rose to 28.33 billion rupees ($629.8 million) from Thursday's 25.86 billion rupees. Gainers outnumbered decliners 1,582 to 1,187, while 148 stocks were unchanged. 

The Congress party and its allies look set to win in state assembly elections in the key state of West Bengal, as well as in Kerala and Assam, but they were lagging in Puducherry and Tamil Nadu. 

With no clear trend emerging from global peers, the outcome of the state assembly elections was eagerly awaited by investors, said  Shanu Goel, a senior research analyst at Bonanza Portfolio. 

Analysts said a favorable outcome would give the Congress-led federal coalition more political heft to push through long-pending reforms in the financial sector and take certain unpopular economic steps, such as raising diesel prices. 

However, worries over high interest rates and slowing economic growth are likely to dominate the market outlook in the coming sessions, said Prakash Diwan, head of institutional business at Networth Stock Broking. 

All but three of the 30 Sensex constituents closed higher Friday.
