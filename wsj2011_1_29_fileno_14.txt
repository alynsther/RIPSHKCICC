What's in a name? With the Feininger clan: confusion. The members of this artistic German-American family have never been easy to keep straight. Pater familias Lyonel (1871-1956) was a painter associated with Expressionism and the Bauhaus, but he also worked in other media. His sons, T. Lux and Andreas, both established successful careers as photographers in the vibrant photo-press of 1930s Europe. Lyonel and his Jewish wife fled Germany in the mid-1930s; their sons followed them to America. T. Lux (who turned 100 in June) lost most of his photographic negatives along the way and took up painting instead. Andreas (1906-99), though, became a luminary of American photojournalism. The striking time-lapse photo of a navy helicopter taken in 1949 for Life magazine is collected in 'Andreas Feininger: A Photographer's Life'  (192 pages, $45)—one of three volumes from the publisher Hatje Cantz chronicling this fecund family. Lyonel was inspired by his sons to take up the camera, as is handsomely documented in 'Lyonel Feininger: Photographs, 1928-1939'  (152 pages, $45). Examples of his best graphic work can be found in   'Lyonel Feininger: Drawings and Watercolor'  (144 pages, $45) . Something in a name when it is Feininger.
