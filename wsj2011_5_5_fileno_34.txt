BERLINâ€”German manufacturing orders unexpectedly fell 4.0% in March, as a decline in investment goods limited growth in Europe's largest economy, the economy ministry said Thursday. 

"The participation of large orders was strongly below average," the ministry said in a statement. 

Analysts had forecast orders to remain flat. 

In February, orders climbed a revised 1.9%, compared with the previously reported 2.4% rise.
