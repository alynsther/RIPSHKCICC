Carmelo! Amar'e! The Garden's back!

At least that's how things looked for the Knicks shortly after the NBA All-Star break, when they traded for Carmelo Anthony, who had started for the West All-Star team, to go along with East starter Amar'e Stoudemire. The Knicks joined rare company with that trade: They became the 50th team since the NBA and ABA merged in 1976 that will have ended a season with at least two All-Star starters. The problem is their current season is worse than all but two of those other teams.

Usually, starting at least two All-Stars indicates you're a good team, as the 49 other teams on the list have won two-thirds of their games, and all but three made the playoffs. About one-third of them won NBA titles.

The Knicks, on the other hand, have won 48% of their games on the year and just 37% (7-12) since getting Carmelo.

Of course, by definition, being made an All-Star starter is subjective and based largely on the whims of fan voting. Among this year's 10 All-Star starters, only three are actually among the league's top-10 most productive players, according to Wins Produced, an indicator developed by Southern Utah University economics professor Dave Berri that shows how players' statistics correlate to winning.

What of the two teams to start two-plus All-Stars that had a worse record than this year's Knicks? The 1977-78 Boston Celtics made this small group thanks to an aging-but-popular John Havlicek—they won 39% of their games that season, but won three titles in the next decade. Then there are the 2005-06 Houston Rockets, who won 42% of their games with Yao Ming and Tracy McGrady and little else.
