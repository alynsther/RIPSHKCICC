SINGAPOREâ€”Mapletree Commercial Trust is aiming for a Singapore initial public offering in March, a transaction that could raise up to one billion Singapore dollars (US$772 million), people familiar with the situation said Monday.

Two people said Mapletree Commercial Trust plans to list through a real estate investment trust either in late March or early April on the Singapore Exchange. The trust's portfolio of Singapore properties is valued at about S$2.5 billion. 

The trust's parent, Mapletree Investments, a unit of state-investment company Temasek Holdings Ltd., has hired CIMB, Citigroup, DBS, Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs as advisers on the public offer, the people said. 

Last year, Mapletree Investments, which owns and manages about S$13 billion in real estate assets around the world, said it was keen to list its commercial-property unit, whose portfolio includes assets such as Singapore's Vivocity, HarbourFront and the Port of Singapore Authority building.

Mapletree Investments didn't respond immediately to requests for comment. 

The plans for an IPO follow a listing last year of Mapletree Investments' industrial property unit, known as Mapletree Industrial Trust Ltd., in an IPO that raised S$1.2 billion. 

Mapletree Commercial Trust's IPO comes as Singapore seeks to establish itself as a base for property-related stock offerings and as strong economic growth in the city-state boosts demand for residential and commercial space. 

Several big companies last year raised close to S$2 billion through REIT listings, including  Sabana Shari'ah Compliant Industrial REIT's S$666 million IPO. 

  Pua Seck Guan, CapitaMall Trust's former chief executive, plans to raise about S$1 billion in an IPO through a Singapore REIT planned for March, people familiar with the situation said last week.
