NEW DELHI -- The board of ING Vysya Bank Ltd. approved plans to raise funds through a preferential share sale to its owners and a separate equity sale to institutional investors. 

While the bank still needs to obtain various approvals for this, the plan is to sell 28.6 million shares to raise capital, according to a company statement to the stock exchanges. Of this, up to 15.3 million shares will be sold to qualified institutional buyers through a qualified institutions placement, and up to 13.3 million to the bank's promoters, ING Mauritius Holdings and ING Mauritius Investments I, the bank said.

The decision was made a board meeting on Monday. The board also appointed a five-member committee to oversee the fund-raising plan.

The bank declined to say what the capital would be used for.

ING Vysya Bank closed at 341.85 rupees, down 3.95%, on Monday, on a day when the Bombay Stock Exchange's leading stock index was down 0.72% at 18,998.
