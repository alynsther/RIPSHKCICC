Ready your Sunday best for brunch at the Astor Room, a restaurant that steps back in time. Hidden in the basement of Kaufman Astoria Studios, the spot would be easy to miss if it weren't for the live jazz music emanating from below.

After you walk downstairs, you are greeted by a small music ensemble near the gilded bar to the right of the simple, but elegant dining room. Owner Christopher Vlacich (whose family owns Astoria's Piccola Venezia) said he wanted to bring a little bit of Hollywood glamour to the neighborhood by using the 1940s as inspiration for the décor and food. The restaurant opened in February.

Popular brunch items include the buttermilk fried chicken and waffles ($10), the Astor Disaster, which includes French toast, eggs, bacon, BBQ short rib, cheddar cheese and onion rings ($13), and eggs Benedict with homemade English muffin, house-cured Canadian bacon and hollandaise ($10). All egg dishes are served with Astor home fries, and brunch comes with a complimentary bloody mary or mimosa.
