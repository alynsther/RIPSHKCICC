MANNHEIM, Germany—German economic expectations improved sharply in January, indicating that the euro zone's largest economy is set to continue growing in the months ahead despite the debt crisis in the region, the ZEW think-tank said Tuesday. 

ZEW said its closely watched economic-expectations index increased for the third consecutive month, to 15.4 points in January from 4.3 points in December. 

The outcome was above economists' forecasts of 8.0 points, indicating that Germany's robust economic recovery will continue in the first half of 2011.

German gross domestic product increased 3.6% last year in price-adjusted terms, which marks the strongest increase since pan-German records began in 1992. 

"The currently low level of real interest rates should strengthen demand for capital equipment in Germany," said ZEW president  Wolfgang Franz, adding that improved labor-market conditions are boosting private consumption. 

Analysts may also have taken heart from rising stock-market valuations, with the German DAX up more than 3% since the start of the year. 

The assessment of current economic conditions was at its highest since July 2007, with the corresponding indicator gaining 0.2 points to be at 82.8 points in January, the ZEW survey of 284 analysts and institutional investors showed. 

"The diversified export mix, the labor market and a further strengthening of private consumption should put growth in 2011 on a broad footing," said ING economist  Carsten Brzeski. 

Separately, the United Nations estimated Tuesday that the German economy will grow 2.2% this year, which would be well above its predictions for the euro zone as a whole. 

In its annual report on the World Economic Situation and Prospects, the U.N. said the euro-zone economy will grow 1.3% this year, a slower expansion than the 1.6% recorded in 2010.
