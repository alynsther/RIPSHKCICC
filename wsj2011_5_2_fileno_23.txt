's stake in Henkel India Ltd., according to two people involved in the deal. 

At this valuation, Jyothy will have to pay around 1.2 billion rupees ($27 million) to acquire Henkel AG's 50.97% stake in the Indian unit.

The deal still is in negotiations, and no final decision has been made yet, the people said. 

Jyothy Labs, the maker of Ujala fabric whitener, was not expected to make an offer beyond 35 rupees (79 cents) a share, the price Jyothy paid to acquire Tamilnadu Petroproducts Ltd.'s stake in Henkel India, sources had said earlier.

Henkel sells detergents and bath soaps in India including Henko, Mr White, Pril, Fa, Neem and Margo.

Jyothy has received a line of credit from some banks including ICICI Ltd. for more than 6 billion rupees ($135.4 million).

"We have been approached by almost all bankers such as Deutsche Bank, Axis and HSBC for ready credit lines to fund the upcoming transaction as we are a debt-free company," a Jyothy official had said earlier.

Jyothy acquired Tamilnadu Petroproducts's 14.9% stake in Henkel India for 607.3 million rupees ($13.7 million), valuing each share at 35 rupees (79 cents). 

Henkel India is saddled with high debt and declining margins. Its debt was 3.86 billion rupees ($87 million) as of Dec. 31, 2009, according to its annual report for that year. The firm hasn't filed its annual report for 2010.

Both Jyothy and Henkel India haven't responded yet to calls seeking comment.
