With their pitching staff still not as deep as they'd like, the Yankees have signed veteran starter Kevin Millwood to a minor league contract.

The signing won't impact the battle for the final two rotation spots—Millwood is ticketed for Triple-A, general manager Brian Cashman said—but if another starter falters, Millwood could be an option early in the season. 

"I don't know if he can help us or not," Cashman said. "But I'm willing to put a no-risk, possible reward option that's been on the table the whole time. We'll put him in, get him ready, get him into competition, see if there's anything there. If there is, we'll have some decisions to make." 

Millwood, 36, would earn $1.5 million if he makes the big-league club, plus incentives. The 14-year-veteran has a May 1 opt-out in his contract.

The injury occurred in the first quarter of Wednesday's win over the Cleveland Cavaliers. Gaines, 24, was averaging 5.5 points and 2.5 assists in his ten appearances with the team.

In the midst of a playoff battle, the Rangers start a four game road trip on Saturday when they head to Boston to take on the Bruins at 1 p.m. in what could be a potential playoff preview. The Rangers, who are 7-1-1 in their past nine, are in seventh place in the Eastern Conference with 85 points. The Blueshirts are a likely playoff team, with a seven-point cushion over the ninth-place Carolina Hurricanes and seven games left in the season. The top eight teams from the conference make the playoffs. The Bruins are in sixth place with 92 points.
