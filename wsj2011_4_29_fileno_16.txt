MUMBAI â€“ Indian shares extended their losses to the fifth straight session Friday, led by declines in banks due to concerns that the Reserve Bank of India will raise interest rates when it meets to review monetary policy next week. 

The Bombay Stock Exchange's Sensitive Index fell 156.06 points, or 0.8%, to close at 19135.96 after moving between 19015.05 and 19356.50. The benchmark fell 2.4% during the week. 

On the National Stock Exchange, the 50-stock S&P CNX Nifty fell 35.95 points, or 0.6%, to end at 5749.50. 

Trading volume on the BSE fell slightly to 29.92 billion rupees ($675 million) from Thursday's 30.79 billion rupees. Gainers lagged decliners 940 to 1,960, while 98 stocks were unchanged. 

"The markets have factored in a 25-basis-point increase in policy rates, but now investors are increasingly taking the view that the RBI may go for a half-a-percentage-point hike to combat inflation," said Prakash Diwan, head of institutional business at Networth Stock Broking. 

The RBI's rate-setting meeting is scheduled for Tuesday. 

Mr. Diwan expects the benchmark to remain choppy ahead of the monetary policy review and also because a number of large-cap companies such as Bharti Airtel and Hero Honda Motors are scheduled to report earnings next week. 

Of the 30 Sensex constituents, 21 ended lower Friday. 

Banking shares fell despite a string of good quarterly earnings from major banks over the past two weeks due to concerns that higher policy rates will increase deposit costs.  HDFC Bank shed 2.0% to 2,292.50 rupees and State Bank of India, the country's largest lender by assets, closed 1.9% down at 2,805.60 rupees.

Engineering company Larsen & Toubro, which has a 5.7% weight in the Sensex, fell 3.9% to 1,597.90 rupees.

Oil & Natural Gas Corp. shed 2.8% to 308.90 rupees as investors took profits following the stock's 5.0% gain in the previous three sessions. 

Among non-Sensex losers, auto maker TVS Motor fell 5.7% to 56.35 rupees after missing the January-March profit estimate due to a sharp increase in raw-material expenses. 

Reliance Industries, India's largest company by market capitalization, rose 0.8% to 981.95 rupees on bargain-buying after falling 6.3% in the previous four sessions. 

Investors bought consumer goods makers as a defense against further Sensex falls. Hindustan Unilever rose 2.2% to 285.20 rupees and  ITC
