Sixteen games since their mega-deal for Carmelo Anthony, the new Knicks are struggling to find consistency. But when you assess how various five-man units have performed since the trade, a solution becomes clear for coach Mike D'Antoni: Find more court time for Toney Douglas and Jared Jeffries.

The Knicks lineup with those two plus Anthony, Landry Fields and Amar'e Stoudemire is by far the most productive of D'Antoni's combinations. In 82.5 minutes of court time—the most of any five-man unit since the trade—this quintet has outscored the opposition by 32 points.

Douglas is also featured in the Knicks second most productive lineup, which swaps Shawne Williams for Jeffries and Chauncey Billups for Fields. That unit is plus-11 points in 32.6 minutes. It's D'Antoni's fifth-most utilized unit, surprisingly low considering its explosive scoring ability—especially from behind the three-point arc. Perhaps D'Antoni's reluctance is due to Douglas generally being far more effective playing the point by himself (plus-143 points in 863 minutes) than when sliding over to shooting guard (minus-78 in 776 minutes).

Douglas is clearly a solid defender and explosive scorer who drained a team-record nine three pointers just last week. Jeffries's value is more difficult to quantify given his 19 points in 267 minutes (30% shooting). But he's second on the Knicks in offensive rebounds per minute and his 6-foot-11 frame provides better defensive resistance.

Yet during Monday night's epic collapse at the Garden to the Celtics, Jeffries sat out the decisive final 11 minutes. Douglas left soon after with the Knicks still up by five, returning only after Boston had seized control late in the game.
