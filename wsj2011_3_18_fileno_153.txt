Upcoming auctions and shows in London cover golden moments in printmaking, with works by great artist-printmakers through the ages depicting themes of love and hate, beauty and ugliness, entertainment and sport.

Forget the idea that prints are simply reproductions. The ones that appear in leading auction houses and are sold at reputable galleries are artworks in their own right, achieving fascinating images through the combination of an artist's creativity and a printer's technological know-how.

Sotheby's sale on March 30 will begin with numerous works by Albrecht Dürer (1471-1528), one of the greatest printmakers. They include a pair of celestial maps that are the oldest printed star charts published in Europe. Depicting the northern and southern skies, the woodcuts from around 1515 are hand-colored and decorated with animals and figures (estimate: £120,000-£180,000). A contrasting image by Dürer will be "Melancholia" (1514), showing a winged figure sitting in despair (estimate: £40,000-£70,000). 

Another highlight will be 10 prints by Paul Gauguin, executed in Tahiti and France between 1894 and 1902. Depicting life on the Polynesian island, they are expected to fetch a total of around £430,000-£574,000. "Crouching Tahitian Woman," a delicate rendering from the back of a nude figure, is estimated at £180,000-£220,000; and "Idole Tahitienne," a mysterious, god-like apparition, at £30,000-£50,000. "It is extremely rare to see such a group and in such wonderful condition," Severine Nackers, Sotheby's head of prints Europe, says of the prints, which come from American collector Stanley J. Seeger.

Sotheby's and Christie's (on March 29) will also have a number of works by Pablo Picasso. An electrifyingly colorful "Bust of a Woman Wearing a Hat" (1962) is estimated at £300,000-£350,000 at Christie's. At Sotheby's, a black-and-white portrait of the artist's wife Jacqueline from 1963 is expected to fetch £80,000-£120,000. 

For collectors interested in the way Picasso created his prints, a show entitled "Pablo Picasso: Portrait Lithographs" runs from March 24 to April 21 in London at the Alan Cristea Gallery, Europe's largest publisher and dealer in 20th-century prints. "Picasso was the arch experimenter in printmaking. He continually transformed his images," says Alan Cristea. The gallery will show stages in the development of individual prints during Picasso's golden years of printmaking, from 1945 to the 1950s. The war years were frustrating for Picasso as the printmaking world closed down, says Mr. Cristea. After the war, he teamed up with Paris printer Fernand Mourlot, and a burst of activity followed. "Femme au Fauteuil No. 1" (1948) is featured in the exhibition in its second stage, priced at £60,000; and in its ninth stage, at £150,000.

For sports fans, Dreweatts will on April 20 offer at its Berkshire showrooms highlights from American collector Norman R. Bobins's British sporting prints. A rare golfing print from 1790 by Francis Abbott depicts a haughty gentleman golfer on the course with his caddie. The piece is dedicated to the oldest golf club in the world, the Society of Golfers at Blackheath (estimate: £6,000-£8,000).

The London Original Print Fair will take place April 19-21 at the Royal Academy of Art. More than 50 exhibitors will offer prints through the centuries, with prices ranging from £100 to more than £100,000. The fair is a good opportunity to see what is on the market, as well as to learn about prints and discover what is to your taste. There is an accompanying program of talks and children's workshops.
