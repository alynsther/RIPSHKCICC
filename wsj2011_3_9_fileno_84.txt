Four years on the sidelines was enough: Tiki Barber wants back on the football field. It just won't be with the Giants.

The agent for the Giants' all-time leading rusher confirmed Tuesday that Barber had filed papers with the NFL and the Giants requesting that he be taken off the reserve-retirement list. The Giants in turn released a statement wishing Barber well and saying they will release the back as soon as they are allowed.

"We are optimistic there will be teams interested in Tiki,'' Mark Lepselter, Barber's agent, said.

It's been four years since Barber played his last game, and it's one month until his 36th birthday. He has worked in broadcasting for NBC and more recently for Yahoo. One month ago at the Super Bowl in Dallas, Barber described himself as a journalist, telling the Wall Street Journal that he didn't miss football at all, that "my mind has flipped."

Since then, Lepselter said, "Tiki was intrigued by certain things." Trainer Joe Carini, who worked with Barber from 2004-2006 said he began seriously working out two weeks ago. Carini said Barber is 198 pounds, 10 shy of his playing weight, and that he believes Barber could be NFL-ready in "a couple weeks."

Barber was certainly still in NFL shape when he retired, closing his final season with 1,662 yards. His 15,632 yards from scrimmage rank 12th all-time and he holds the Giants' all-time rushing marks with 10,499 yards and 55 touchdowns.

Barber announced his retirement in the middle of the 2006 season. From the broadcast booth, he has been critical of quarterback Eli Manning and coach Tom Coughlin and was roundly booed at the ceremony inducting him into Giants' Ring of Honor this past season.

Barber himself could not be reached for comment, but Lepselter said his client's motivation is only personal competitiveness to return to the NFL.
