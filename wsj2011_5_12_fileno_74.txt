Little Town NYC, a new craft beer bar near Union Square, has a painting depicting a "Greetings from New York" postcard, with logos of breweries from around the state overlaid on a map. It's the perfect metaphor for a place offering only New York beers and a menu of regional favorites.



Its 24 draft and more than 50 bottled beer varieties is among the most extensive New York state beer lists. The menu includes takes on Rochester's Garbage Plate and Buffalo wings, as well as a raw bar of Long Island oysters and clams. 

Warm weather beers are Brewery Ommegang's Witte or Kelso of Brooklyn's pilsner. For hopheads, there's Hurricane Kitty from Keegan Ales and Sixpoint's Bengali Tiger, both India pale ales. The bar also offers New York wines, spirits and sodas. Produce for menu items comes from the nearby greenmarket, said co-owner Michael Sinensky. 

"New York has seriously the best things to offer," he said.
