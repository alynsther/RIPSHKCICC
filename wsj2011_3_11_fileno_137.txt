MUMBAIâ€”Indian shares fell for a second consecutive session Friday after a powerful earthquake jolted Japan's northern coast and triggered a tsunami, sparking selloffs in markets across Asia and Europe. 

The Bombay Stock Exchange's Sensitive Index fell 153.89 points, or 0.8%, to 18174.09, its lowest close this month. The index lost 1.7% for the week, its seventh weekly loss in the last 10 weeks.

On the National Stock Exchange, the 50-stock S&P CNX Nifty fell 48.95 points, or 0.9%, to 5445.45. 

Volume on the BSE rose to 39.92 billion rupees ($885 million) from Thursday's 29.84 billion rupees. Decliners bested advancers, 1,928 to 924, while 118 stocks were unchanged. 

Elsewhere in Asia, Japan's Nikkei Stock Average fell 1.7%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng shed 1.6% while China's Shanghai Composite fell 0.8%. In Europe, France's CAC was down 1%, while Germany's DAX was down 1.1%. 

The 8.9-magnitude quake was strongest earthquake to hit Japan in at least 300 years. Police say 200 to 300 bodies have been found in the city of Sendai, the closest major city to the quake's epicenter, wire reports said. Another 110 were confirmed killed, with 350 people missing, the Associated Press reported. Police also said at least 544 people were injured, according to the AP. 

Tsunami warnings were issued for 53 countries around the world, including Mexico, New Zealand, Indonesia, Taiwan and the West Coast of the U.S. 

India's government said in a statement there was no tsunami threat to the country. 

"Considering how badly the U.S. markets did overnight [the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.6% to below 12000] and the losses in the world markets today following the quake in Japan, our market has been quite resilient. This is a positive sign," said  Jagdish Malkani, country head at TAIB Capital. 

He said he expects an uptrend in Indian markets provided that crude- oil prices continue to soften. By late morning in New York, light, sweet crude for April delivery was off $2.92, or 2.8%, at $99.78 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 

Of the 30 Sensex constituents, 25 ended lower Friday. 

Technology led the fall as investors rushed to take profits after the recent advance and amid fears the earthquake would hurt demand for software exports. Tata Consultancy Services fell 2.9% to 1,076.25 rupees;  Infosys Technologies shed 1.1% to 3,054.45 rupees. 

Metals extended earlier losses, as investors turned uncertain about how the natural disaster would impact demand and metal prices.  Sterlite Industries fell 3.1% to 160.15 rupees, while Tata Steel sank 2.5% to 582.00 rupees. JSW Steel, which isn't part of the Sensex and in which Japan's JFE Steel Corp. owns a 14.8% stake, fell 3.9% to 901.85 rupees. 

Among other Sensex decliners, Bharat Heavy Electricals fell 3.6% to 1,974.70 rupees, while Reliance Communications shed 3.5% to 96.30 rupees. 

Oil & Natural Gas extended its advance to a second straight session on media reports Thursday that the state-run company's planned share sale may be deferred to the quarter ending in September. 

"This is a positive for ONGC since it shows the government wants to get a good valuation and not just push the share sale through even though it needs the funds," said  Jagdish Meghnani, vice president of institutional research at Alchemy Share & Stock Brokers. ONGC was also supported by the fall in crude prices and rose 2.1% to 281.30 rupees.
