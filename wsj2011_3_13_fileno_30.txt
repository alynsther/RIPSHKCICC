Wondering why there's a little more in your paycheck these days, even though you didn't get a raise?

You're not alone. Nearly half of Americans surveyed didn't know tax-code changes have resulted in a small boost to their wages starting Jan. 1, according to a recent poll by the National Foundation for Credit Counseling.

Under the tax law passed late last year, the Social Security payroll tax was cut by two percentage points for 2011.

That means most workers are paying 4.2% of their earnings in Social Security tax this year, instead of 6.2%, says  Mark Lassiter, a spokesman for the Social Security Administration. (This rate doesn't include the Medicare tax portion of the Social Security tax rate.)

A person making $50,000 in 2011 can expect to get an extra $1,000. The maximum salary amount subject to the Social Security tax this year is $106,800.

Those who are self-employed and, thus, don't have an employer that pays part of the Social Security tax, are now paying 10.4% of their income, down from 12.4%.

How can you make the most of this small windfall? Financial advisers recommend putting the extra earnings into a 401(k) or individual retirement account. Since that extra contribution will be on a pretax basis you'll be reducing your taxable income, lowering your taxes even further, says  Kathy Pickering, executive director of the Tax Institute at  H&R Block.
