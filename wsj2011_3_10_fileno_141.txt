For a place long on tradition, Perry's tries to keep pace with the changing demands of Bay Area diners. 

Much of the paraphernalia on the walls of the Union Street bar and grill—photos of Secretariat, Muhammad Ali and Marilyn Monroe—date to close to the restaurant's 1969 opening, joined only somewhat more recently by pictures of onetime regulars including Boz Scaggs. 

While the décor has remained, the menu has been remade many times over. "We were pretty heavy in the meat and potatoes," said owner Perry Butler. Over the years, he has added salads and seafood to the hamburgers and French onion soup. The menu now contains words like "local" and "organic."

Mr. Butler eats at other restaurants to stay current on food trends and asks customers what they would like him to offer. New items are added much more often than old ones are removed, he said. 

The crowd includes young professionals and older diners who nurse martinis. In the last few years, Mr. Butler opened locations in the Financial District and Potrero Hill, in part because several of his children have joined the family business. Those locations attract business lunchers and design professionals, respectively. Most dishes on the lunch menu cost less than $15. 

There's "nothing innovative or unexpected," about Perry's, said Sarah Rotman Epps, a technology analyst who ate at the Financial District location recently. But it's a "solid, reliable standby" with good food and an upbeat atmosphere, she said. 

The original Perry's is located at 1944 Union St. in San Francisco and serves lunch starting at 11 a.m.
