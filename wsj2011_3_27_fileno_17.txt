TOKYOâ€”Radiation levels in the air in central Tokyo on Sunday continued to fall, while the city's water readings stayed within permissible levels for infants, according to official figures from the Tokyo government. 

The Tokyo Metropolitan Government said on its website that radiation levels in downtown Tokyo stood at 0.115 microsievert an hour at about 0600 GMT. That is lower than 0.120 microsievert an hour at 0600 GMT Saturday, but higher than the 0.035 microsievert an hour a person typically would be exposed to in downtown Tokyo due to background radiation. 

A chest X-ray typically exposes the patient to a radiation dose of about 100 microsieverts, according to the Radiological Society of North America. 

Meanwhile, the city said a sample taken from the Kanamachi water purifying plant in north of Tokyo showed radioactive iodine reading declined to 34 becquerels per kilogram on Saturday, compared with 51 becquerels per kilogram Friday. They were below the 100 becquerels per kilogram level considered the maximum acceptable for infants. Earlier in the week, officials had warned parents not to give Tokyo water to infants.
