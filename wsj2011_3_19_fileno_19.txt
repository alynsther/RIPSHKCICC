Chris Wilcox threw down a one-handed dunk off a missed shot with 53 seconds left, and the Detroit Pistons rallied from an 11-point, fourth-quarter deficit to beat the Knicks Friday night in Auburn Hills, Mich. After Wilcox's dunk gave Detroit a two-point lead, Carmelo Anthony drove past Tayshaun Prince, but Wilcox was there to force a miss. Anthony felt he was fouled. He finished with six points on 2 of 12 shooting.
