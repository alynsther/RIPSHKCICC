Had they known that Mark Sanchez would post a passer rating above 100 against Pittsburgh's top-ranked defense, Jets fans justifiably would have planned to spend Monday shopping for "2010 AFC Champion" hats.

But instead they were left mourning another close—but cigar-less—finish. Mr. Sanchez became just the third losing quarterback in championship game history with a passer rating of 100 or greater. Having a rating at least this good has been a key winning indicator throughout postseason history. Playoff teams are 195-29 when their quarterback reaches this performance threshold. More bitterly, since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger, no losing playoff team has ever out-passed their opponent, as measured by passer rating, to the extent the Jets did to the Steelers on Sunday.

Ben Roethlisberger finished the day with a 35.5 rating—his sixth-worst game ever—completing 52.6% of his passes for just 133 yards with two interceptions and no touchdowns. Mr. Sanchez completed 60% for 100 more yards with no picks and two scores. But the Jets could not contain the Steelers' running—especially Mr. Roethlisberger's. The Steelers quarterback converted three key third downs with scrambles and also scored a rushing touchdown.

As a result, Gang Green heads into a second-straight offseason trying to shake the stinging memories of watching an opposing team celebrate that long-sought Super Bowl berth. But if the excellence shown by their 24-year-old signal caller in the league's most inhospitable passing environment is any indication, the Jets no longer have to worry about carrying their quarterback to football's promised land. The better question today seems to be: Just how far can Mr. Sanchez carry them?
