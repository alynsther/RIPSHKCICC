 called GE Triveni. Triveni Trubines holds more than 50% in the joint venture; a GE affiliate holds the rest.

  Dhruv M. Sawhney, chairman and managing director of Triveni, said "the turbine business was demerged since it had a different growth path." 

Triveni Engineering will hold 22% stake in Triveni Turbines, and the balance of the shares were issued and allotted to existing shareholders. The company however hopes to list its shares by end of June or mid-July, and plans to apply to the Bombay Stock Exchange next week. 

"Triveni Turbines will not be looking for alternate sources of funds" Mr. Sawhney said, adding that "the capital needed to manufacture the range of turbines is already there."

Mr. Sawhney added that its other units -- water and gears businesses â€“ were performing well, and there were no plans to hive them off.
