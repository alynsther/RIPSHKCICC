It wasn't totally clear what the fashion designer Valentino was doing at the Cinema Society screening of "Thor" on Thursday, but guests were wondering.

Maybe Mr. Valentino likes superhero movies? Maybe he's interested in Chris Hemsworth, the "Australian Viking" newcomer of an actor, as director Kenneth Branagh called him, who plays the Norse warrior? Maybe he had a free evening while in town for the Met Ball on Monday?

In any event, Mr. Valentino wasn't present at the after-party at the Boom Boom Room following the film, but Mr. Branagh was. 

(The evening was sponsored by Acura, which provided the use of many vehicles in "Thor.")

The big-budget summer tent-pole movie is a departure for the actor/director, who is used to smaller scale adaptations of Shakespeare. 

"The scale is immense," Mr. Branagh said, drinking some bottled water in a banquette. "I didn't notice that more than when I first saw the credits. Seven minutes long! Thousands of people, the vast majority of them I knew! I was in a lot of people meetings. But the scale allows you to produce things like men riding on horses on rainbow bridges in outerspace."

Though Mr. Branagh was adamant that the film take place on contemporary Earth and "be funny," he said that "Thor," of course, had Shakespearean overtones. (What doesn't?) 

"This is a family drama about how a man might be fit to be king," he said. "That's the story of Henry IV and Henry V." 

During shooting, Mr. Branagh said he knew he would need a respite from big-budget storytelling. 

"So in September, I'm doing a play in my hometown of Belfast," he said. "It's a French farce called 'The Painkiller.' It's me and another guy in two adjoining hotel rooms. I just want to show up, without a car to take me anywhere. I don't want anything to do with the set or what the posters will look like. I just would like to have a cup of tea and a small bread roll and go on stage."
