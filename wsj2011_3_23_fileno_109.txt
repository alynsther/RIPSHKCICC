Take a glance at the lineup for the 2011 Melbourne Grand Prix and it looks like the new Formula 1 season could be the most competitive in years.

Five former world champions will take their place on the starting grid for Sunday's race, the first time the world's elite auto-racing competition has featured five active titleholders since Jack Brabham, John Surtees, Denny Hulme, Graham Hill and Jackie Stewart were all racing in 1970.

Ask oddsmakers, however, and the new F1 season is shaping up more like a procession than a race: Both Sebastian Vettel, the reigning world champion, and Red Bull, the 2010 constructors champion, are short-priced favorites after setting a blistering pace in preseason testing.

Vettel, the youngest F1 champion in history at the age of 23, can be backed at 23/10 with Unibet, ahead of Ferrari's Fernando Alonso, the 2005 and 2006 champion, who is the second favorite at around 11/4. 

Ferrari should be Red Bull's biggest rival again this year, but it looks wiser to back Alonso at 4/7 with Paddy Power for a top-three finish rather than outright victory in the championship.

Lewis Hamilton, the 2008 winner, is arguably the most talented driver in the sport, but this has been negated over the past two seasons by a disappointing McLaren racecar. At 8/1, he is given only an outside chance of success, as is his McLaren teammate Jenson Button, the 2009 champion and a best-priced 18/1 shot with Stan James.
