LONDON—European markets slumped on Friday, with French and British stocks posting particularly steep losses, as data showing a decline in U.S. consumer sentiment rekindled economic worries. 

Stocks continued to drop into the close as the fourth day of demonstrations in Egypt turned violent, pushing U.S. markets lower as well and sending oil prices surging on fears about supply disruptions.

The Stoxx Europe 600 index dropped 0.9% to end at 280.45. 

Meanwhile, the cost of insuring Egypt's sovereign debt against default rose significantly late in the day as the president of the country called out the army to confront protesters. The annual cost of insuring $10 million against default rose to $450,000 late in Europe, jumping $50,000 in just one hour and up $65,000 from a day earlier, according to data provider Markit. 

Even without the protests, the country's stock market would have been closed; Friday is part of the weekend there. The EGX 30 plummeted 10.5% on Thursday, where trading was halted for 30 minutes immediately after the open after index plunged 6%, and 6.1% on Wednesday.

Among major national European stock-market indexes, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 index fell 1.4% to 5881.37 and France's CAC 40 index sank 1.4% to 4002.32, while the German DAX 30 index shed 0.7% to 7102.80. 

The protests threatened to overshadow other concerns about the global economy. Friday, the U.S. reported that its economy grew at an annualized rate of 3.2% in the last three months of 2010, more than the 2.6% pace in the third quarter but slightly below market expectations. 

As European markets closed, light, sweet crude for March delivery was up $2.42, or 2.8%, at $88.05 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude on the ICE futures exchange rallied $1.38, or 1.4%, at $98.77 a barrel. 

Egypt produces roughly 685,000 barrels of oil per day, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, a figure dwarfed by major oil producers like Saudi Arabia. But the unrest could have a larger impact if the unrest that has already swept Tunisia and Yemen spreads to bigger oil producers, analysts said. 

"If this thing spreads across the North African continent, gets into Libya, Algeria, then you've got trouble," said Stephen Schork, editor of the Schork Report energy newsletter. 

Investors also turned to safe-haven U.S. Treasurys, pushing down yields. Shortly after European markets closed, the benchmark 10-year yield stood at 3.341%, down from a high of 3.455% earlier in the day.
