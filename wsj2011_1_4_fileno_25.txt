WASHINGTONâ€”Here's a New Year's gift from the IRS to taxpayers: three extra days to file tax returns. 

The Internal Revenue Service Tuesday announced that in this 2011 tax filing season, taxpayers will have until Monday, April 18, to file their 2010 tax returns. 

Taxpayers can thank the District of Columbia for the extension. The District of Columbia will observe Emancipation Day, a holiday that celebrates the freeing of slaves in D.C., on the traditional tax filing deadline of Friday, April 15. By law, a D.C. holiday will force the IRS to move its deadline to another day. 

In addition, taxpayers who request more time to file will have until Oct. 17 to submit their returns. 

Meanwhile, some Americans will need to wait until mid-to-late February to file their tax returns this year in wake of tax-law changes Congress approved last month. The IRS has said taxpayers that claim itemized deductions for mortgage interest, medical expenses and charitable deductions, for example, need to hold off. The IRS, at a later date, will announce when it will be able to start processing tax returns impacted by recent tax law changes. 

For taxpayers not impacted by the changes, the IRS will begin accepting e-file and Free File returns on Jan. 14. 

This tax filing season, the IRS expects to receive more than 140 million individual tax returns. A "Where's My Refund?" tool on the www.IRS.gov Web site will allow taxpayers to track the status of their refunds. 

Also, the IRS reiterated that taxpayers with foreign accounts who do not properly report income will face stiff penalties. 

"The IRS has made important strides at stopping tax avoidance using offshore accounts," said IRS Commissioner Doug Shulman. "We continue to focus on offshore tax compliance and people with offshore accounts need to pay taxes on income from those accounts."
