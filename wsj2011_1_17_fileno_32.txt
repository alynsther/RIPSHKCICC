The Ryder Cup used to be the crowning achievement for European golf. 

These days, it's gravy.

Europe won the 2010 Ryder Cup at the Celtic Manor Resort in Wales in October, but it was just another triumph in a banner year for European golf: Graeme McDowell become the first European winner of the U.S. Open for 40 years, while Germany's Martin Kaymer also won a debut major at the PGA Championship, and Lee Westwood became the world No. 1.

Aside from these successes, the European Tour's rebranded Order of Merit—now known as the Race to Dubai—consistently produced high-quality competition. The 2011 Race to Dubai started with a handful of tournaments in South Africa in recent weeks, but the first big event of the new season begins Thursday when the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship launches the European Tour's four-tournament Gulf swing. Messrs. Westwood and Kaymer, at 7/2 and 5/1 on Betdaq respectively, are joined by Rory McIlroy, also 5/1, at the top of the betting.

It's difficult to look past Mr. Westwood to win the Race to Dubai this year. But rather than backing the world No. 1 outright, there is better value in buying his finishing position at 20 with Sporting Index, where even second place will pay 10 times the stake.

Rhys Davies, from Wales, impressed in his first season on the European Tour last year, winning the Trophée Hassan II and setting a course record 62 at Celtic Manor. Back him finish in the top 10 in the 2011 Race to Dubai standings.
