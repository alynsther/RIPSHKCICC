The Knicks made just 37% of their shots on the way to their fifth straight loss on Friday night in San Antonio. The Knicks started Ronny Turiaf at center, sending Wilson Chandler, who normally starts at power forward, to the bench, and shifting Amar'e Stoudemire to forward. Mr. Turiaf provided the defensive spark that Knicks coach Mike D'Antoni was looking for and also grabbed 10 rebounds and scored 10. Other Knicks struggled; rookie shooting guard Landy Fields scored just two points while Mr. Stoudemire had just 18. The Spurs' Tim Duncan scored 21.
