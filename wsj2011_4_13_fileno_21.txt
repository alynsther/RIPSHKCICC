BEIJING—Twenty-four industry associations in China pledged Wednesday to practice pricing restraint, a sign that pressuring private companies continues to be one of Beijing's inflation-fighting methods.

The associations, covering sectors that include agriculture, pharmaceuticals, textiles and kitchen appliances, urged their member companies to heed the State Council's calls to shoulder their social responsibility by maintaining the supply of consumer products and practicing discipline in raising prices.

The associations pledged not to collude on prices or hoard resources, among other actions, according to their joint statement, which was issued by the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, a semiofficial body that helps implement government policy in the private sector.

"China needs to prevent a too-fast rise in consumer prices and avoid big economic fluctuations," it said.

The associations' statement is the latest sign Beijing is pressuring companies and using other unconventional tactics to combat rising inflation. Economists widely expect March's consumer-inflation rate, due to be reported Friday, to be the highest in more than two years.
