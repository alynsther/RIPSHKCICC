Remember  Michael Flatley? The so-called Lord of the Dance? Well, he's been touring his famous step-dancing for 16 years.

 In March, the 52-year-old is finally making it into 3-D. The aptly titled "Lord of the Dance in 3D" will hit theaters, appropriately, Mr. Flately said recently, on St. Patrick's Day. 

"For years, people have been asking us to do a movie," Mr. Flatley said. "And right now dance is red-hot and 3D is new and important, so it just seemed perfectly suited."

 Mr. Flatley, who has houses in Ireland, London and the French Riviera but had just flown in to New York last week from his house in Barbados, was asked which 3D films he'd especially enjoyed since the resurgence of the technology.

 "I don't watch too many movies and I've barely watched television in 20 years," he said. "I have a young son so I have to watch Mickey Mouse and Thomas the Tank Engine. I saw 'Avatar' recently and I thought it was a great story but I was unimpressed by the dialogue." 

Did he consider asking  James Cameron to direct "Lord of the Dance in 3D"? "He's a legend," Mr. Flatley said. "I don't know that we could afford him." 

Right behind the release of Mr. Flatley's film is that of another heartthrob's in 3D:  Justin Bieber's "Never Say Never," which hits theaters Feb. 11. 

How did Mr. Flatley suss out the competition? 

"How can you answer that?" he said. "We're totally different worlds. I don't want to answer either way. I have every confidence in our film. We have an enormous global fan base. We're as big in South Africa as we are in Holland or Russia or Taiwan. I know Justin is big in America, but our show is for ages 5 to 95 with no barriers. We're a sleeper that comes in under the radar."
