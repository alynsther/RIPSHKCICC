U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has asked regulators to make sure fraud or manipulation doesn't prevent consumers from enjoying lower gas prices at the pump as the price of crude oil declines.

In a memo sent to several federal agencies Friday, Mr. Holder said he wanted members of a new federal gas-fraud working group to look at the issue and to propose possible solutions at a meeting later in May.

Mr. Holder's interest in making sure declines in wholesale oil prices trickle down to consumers follows a dramatic drop in crude markets. On Thursday, the price of crude oil fell 8.6%, slipping below $100 for the first time since March.

"If wholesale prices continue to decrease, fraud or manipulation must not be allowed to prevent price decreases from being passed on to consumers at the pump," Mr. Holder said in his memo.

Mr. Holder formed a working group in April to determine whether illegal activity was affecting wholesale and retail energy markets.

According to AAA, the average price of gasoline has climbed to $3.98 a gallon. The price has moved well above the $4-a-gallon threshold in many parts of the nation.
