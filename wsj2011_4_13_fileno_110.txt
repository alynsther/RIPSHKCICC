  Q: I am my 9-year-old son's primary caregiver, and I recently applied to an executive MBA program. During a conversation explaining why my application was rejected, the admissions director told me that [as a father], entering the program wasn't worth it if it would affect my relationship with my son. This seemed discriminatory to me. Do women hear this type of statement when they have or are expecting children? 

—G.R., Riverside, Calif.

 A: Many mothers have heard similar assertions in job interviews, based on my reporting and email. Such statements by hiring managers sometimes serve later, if the woman is rejected, as grounds for claims of sex discrimination. As a working father, however, you aren't subject to the same anti-discrimination protections under federal law.

In general, federal law doesn't prohibit discrimination against people solely because they are parents, says  David Conforto, an attorney in Boston who represents employees. Parents aren't a protected class under the law, so treating both working fathers and working mothers unfavorably compared with their childless colleagues isn't prohibited. But discrimination based on characteristics related to a person's sex is prohibited. In employment settings, it is illegal to stereotype working mothers by assuming that a female employee will be less committed to her job because she is a mother, while not making the same negative assumption about a man who is a father, Mr. Conforto says. Comparable protections against gender bias are afforded women in schools, colleges and universities under the legislation commonly known as Title IX, which bars educational institutions that receive federal funds from discriminating based on sex. 

State or local laws may provide additional protections for working parents. You would need to see an attorney for legal advice specific to your situation.
