The Bloomberg administration tapped  Mathew Wambua, a city housing official, to succeed  Rafael Cestero as commissioner for the Department of Housing Preservation and Development.

Mr. Wambua, 40 years old, is an executive vice president at the city's Housing Development Corp., an agency that finances new development of below-market-rate housing. He previously worked in City Hall as a senior policy adviser.

His appointment comes as new construction of housing remains slow and as countless owners who bought apartment buildings in 2006 and 2007 in low-income neighborhoods are now losing buildings to lenders.

Mr. Cestero said in January that he was leaving to take a job with housing developer L&M Development Partners. As HPD commissioner, he was well received by housing advocates and among other city officials, as he realigned the city's affordable housing creation and preservation plan to deal with changes brought by a souring economy.
