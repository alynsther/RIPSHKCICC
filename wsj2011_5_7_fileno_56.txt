Down at the Lower East Side restaurant Los Feliz, just in time for Cinco de Mayo, the burlesque artist  Dita Von Teese introduced her new cocktail: the MargaDita. The reason this is her new cocktail is, you see, Ms. Von Teese actually has another cocktail named after her. That one is called the Cointreau Teese, and it is made with violet liquor. (Ms. Von Teese is a global ambassador for the alcohol company.)

The MargaDita, obviously, is a twist on the margarita, with 1.5 ounces of Cointreau, a half ounce of rose syrup and a pinch of chipotle spice. If you are making it correctly, it should be garnished with "floating organic yellow rose petals," at least according to the traditional recipe. The cocktail will be available at Los Feliz as well as at Toloache in Midtown.

"Margaritas are one of my favorite cocktails to make at home," Ms. Von Teese said. "People don't realize how easy it is to make them." 

At first, Ms. Von Teese wanted a savory cocktail to complement the sweeter Cointreau Teese, she said. 

"We were thinking of bringing tomatoes into it," she recalled. "But once they brought the rose and chipotle, I was like, 'This is the one.'" 

Ms. Von Teese is looking to incorporate the beverage into her act: "I want to do a Mexican Hat Dance around a margarita glass." 

But, she explained, "It's a $50,000 to $100,000 venture every time I do a new show, and I'm still on the fence as to whether I'll invest in a margarita glass." 

Right now, she keeps an oversize Champagne glass, two martini glasses and a Cointreauversial glass (built by the brand) in a big storage unit in California.

At her own launch party, Ms. Von Teese said she drank two MargaDitas. 

"Part of enjoying cocktails is being able to make a glamorous exit," she said.
