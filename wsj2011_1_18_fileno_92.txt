's biggest individual shareholder, said the bank's 2010 results were good, reiterating his support for its chief executive,  Vikram Pandit. 

The prince congratulated Mr. Pandit on the bank's full-year profit of $10.6 billion and reaffirmed his support for Citigroup's management, according to an emailed statement from his firm Kingdom Holding Co. 

Earlier Tuesday, shares of Citigroup dropped almost 5%, despite the banking giant swinging to a fourth-quarter profit, after results fell short of expectations. Citigroup reported quarterly net income of $1.3 billion, or four cents a share, compared with a loss of $7.6 billion, or 33 cents a share, in the fourth quarter of 2009. 

Last year, the Saudi billionaire told Fox Business that 2010 was the year Mr. Pandit had "to deliver" results and that shareholders had already given the U.S. bank two years to turn around. Prince Alwaleed had previously grown impatient with the U.S. bank's former CEO,  Chuck Prince, complaining that its costs were rising faster than revenue.
