PARIS—The trial of former French President Jacques Chirac was suspended on Monday, just two hours after its start, when judges said they needed to first examine a constitutional claim lodged by a co-defendant in the case.

The Paris court said it would make a decision by Tuesday on whether to accept or reject the claim. If the claim is deemed "serious," judges will refer it to a higher court and the trial of Mr. Chirac will be adjourned indefinitely.

Mr. Chirac, who wasn't present in court on Monday, is due to stand trial on embezzlement charges related to his stint as Paris mayor.

In 2009, investigating magistrate Xavière Simeoni ordered Mr. Chirac to stand trial on criminal charges for allegedly adding several people to the city payroll while he was mayor of Paris between 1977 and 1995, even though their work was of no use to the city.

Mr. Chirac has repeatedly denied the allegation and argued that the jobs were legitimate. His lawyer, Jean Veil, declined to comment ahead of the trial.

If the trial takes place, it will be the first time in recent history that a former French head of state defends himself before a judge.

On Monday, however, a lawyer for  Rémy Chardon, a co-defendant in the trial who was Mr. Chirac's chief of staff at the time, submitted a constitutional claim to the court.

The claim challenges an earlier decision by prosecutors to dismiss the statute of limitations in the case. The claim argues that the basis for the prosecution's decision violates France's constitution.
