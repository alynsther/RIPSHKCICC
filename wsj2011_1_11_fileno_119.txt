"Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark" led at the Broadway box office last week, unseating "Wicked" from a top slot it had largely owned since 2004.

Julie Taymor's musical, which has not yet officially opened, surpassed "Wicked" in box-office receipts by just $58, according to data released Monday by the Broadway League. Both productions grossed around $1.59 million in the week ending Sunday, with "The Lion King," Ms. Taymor's other current Broadway musical, coming in third at $1.55 million.

"Wicked," which opened in 2003, has come in first at the box office almost without interruption for 337 weeks, according to that production. 

Shows still in previews are typically outmatched at the box office by longer-running productions that have benefitted from critical reception. "Spider-Man," whose unusually long preview period is set to run 10 weeks, with opening night slated for Feb. 7, has not had to fight for attention, with recent media coverage focused on delays and cast injuries. 

Another factor: The Foxwoods Theatre has 1,930 seats, compared with the 1,809-seat George Gershwin, where "Wicked" plays. Average paid admission to "Wicked' last week was $109.76, compared with $102.86 for "Spider-Man."
