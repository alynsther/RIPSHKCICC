 "I just visited our store here in Santa Barbara, [Calif.,] and they were telling me in the store that Santa Barbara customers are very local-oriented. And the interesting thing is how people define local. See, I'm from Texas. We define local as anything grown in Texas. And Texas is as big as Germany or France. But here, they define local as what's grown in Santa Barbara County. I said, what about Ventura County? That's just a few miles down the road. No, no. It's got to be Santa Barbara County. So local is kind of nebulous in the sense that it's not that well-defined for a lot of people."
