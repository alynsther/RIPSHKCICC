The 18-foot ceilings and large windows in her Williamsburg duplex did more than just call out to  Missy Koo when she was shopping for an apartment.

 "People say that if the home sings to you, you know it's yours," said the handbag and knitwear designer. "This was screaming at us."

The Brooklyn loft is now on the market for $619,000. 

Ms. Koo and her husband, Kee, who works as a motion-graphic designer, purchased the Brooklyn duplex while the unit was still under construction in 2005 for $578,366, according to property records. The couple camped out in a rental apartment until work on the space was completed about a year later.

When they moved in, the couple mainly occupied the lower level, which features a bedroom, a study and a bathroom. 

"It really bummed me out that we weren't using the stairs," she said. So in 2007, the couple decided to convert the mezzanine space upstairs into a master bedroom with translucent sliding doors. 

The couple also overhauled the duplex's upstairs bathroom, which Ms. Koo said had been too modern for her taste. "It was form over function," she said of the stark bathroom that featured white walls and tiles. 

The remodeled bathroom was treated with a larger shower as well as navy and beige ceramic tiles. Ms. Koo said the renovations cost about $30,000. 

The couple and their two young children have already moved to Park Slope, Brooklyn, to be closer to Ms. Koo's family.

 She said the loft, which also features a private roof deck and two balconies, is currently being rented for $3,000 a month. 

The 1,180-square-foot home was listed in February with aptsandlofts.com.
