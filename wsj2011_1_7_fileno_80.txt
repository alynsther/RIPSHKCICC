LAS VEGAS—Investors are hardly the only ones friending Facebook Inc. these days.

Gadget makers increasingly are adding Facebook to their products as the social-networking company extends its reach beyond the Web and into consumers' pockets.

At this week's Consumer Electronics Show here, companies are showing products from cameras to video-game consoles that integrate Facebook into their core functions. They allow people to log in to the service from the gadgets and bring in and send out information about themselves and their friends, as well as their photos.

Such integration offers a glimpse of why some investors think Facebook could become one of the biggest players in tech.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

 and Digital Sky Technologies recently agreed to invest $500 million in Facebook that values the company at $50 billion—greater than the market capitalization of Web giants such as eBay Inc.

The gadgets reflect Facebook's effort to flesh out what it calls its open platform, the system the company has been building since 2007 that allows outside websites, apps and services to share information with Facebook. The platform is designed to be the "core of the Facebook experience," Facebook chief technology officer Bret Taylor said in an interview, turning the site into a hub for its 550 million users' digital lives.

"There's a big disparity between the really deep social interactions we have in the physical world and what is going on online and with consumer electronics," Mr. Taylor said. "There's a really big opportunity for innovative companies to build a social experience into their products."

To date, more than two million websites and hundreds of devices have integrated with Facebook, Mr. Taylor said. For example, Sony Corp.'s Handycam camcorders and Bloggie camera include an ability to upload photos and video to Facebook directly. (The devices themselves don't have Internet connectivity, so users tag the photo or video to be uploaded later when they are hooked up to a computer.)

Even pop star Lady Gaga got in on the Facebook action, announcing at an event for Polaroid that a future digital camera from the company would be able to send pictures directly into Facebook, as well as Twitter and other social media sites.

Chumby Industries Inc. of San Diego makes an eponymous wireless Internet device that can display status updates and photos from their Facebook.

Daniel Hertz, a 17-year old high-school student in London, said he uses the Chumby as well as his iPhone to access Facebook more than he uses the site itself. "I definitely don't use the site as much as I did," he said.

 integrated Facebook into its connected television media drive in its recently launched WD TV Live Hub, letting users look at photos and video, comment on friends' pages and upload photos and videos directly to their Facebook page from the drive. 

Facebook still has a long way to go in making money from these sorts of integrations. Analysts estimate the company's 2010 revenue was as high as $2 billion, mostly from advertising, but also platform efforts such as social games, for which Facebook sells users a virtual currency to pay for game elements.

Access to the platform beyond social games doesn't cost anything or require prior approval by Facebook, though developers and device makers must abide by Facebook terms on issues such as handling user data.

The extension of Facebook's platform to devices could set the stage for the eventual expansion of its advertising business or other revenue streams, said Debra Aho Williamson, an analyst at eMarketer.

"Could there be a future way for Facebook to generate revenue from these devices incorporating their functionality? Yes," she said.Mr. Taylor said monetizing the platform wasn't the core goal. "The platform makes the Facebook experience more meaningful," he said.
