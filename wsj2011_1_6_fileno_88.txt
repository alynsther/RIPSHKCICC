Nestled in the lobby of the Taj Campton Place hotel near San Francisco's Union Square, Campton Place Restaurant offers an upscale lunch menu that attracts shoppers and nearby office workers.

The restaurant, which is nearly 30 years old and specializes in California cuisine that has spicy overtones, earned a Michelin star for the first time last year. Popular dishes include poussin roulade with cauliflower, chanterelles and Périgord truffles ($24), and shrimp simmered in spices with a string hoppers—a noodle dish, with korma sauce and black mustard ($26), says  Rahul Nair, the hotel's director of food and beverage.

While entrees range from $19 to $26, the menu also features a ritzy appetizer of California Golden Osetra caviar for $95, among other starters. For diners seeking a quicker, less-pricey meal, a bar and bistro adjoin the restaurant, serving traditional bistro items such as soups and sandwiches.

The bistro is where Peter and Susanna Pau from Hillsborough ate on a recent visit to San Francisco. "It's convenient because we can just drop by here," Mr. Pau says, adding that "Union Square doesn't have that many places" to eat.

Ms. Pau says she opts to eat in the more-formal restaurant when she visits the shopping district with friends and has more time to spare. She likes the dining room's small size, and "the food is good," she says. 

Located at 340 Stockton St. in San Francisco, Campton Place Restaurant serves lunch from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. Monday through Friday and from noon to 2 p.m. on Saturday.
