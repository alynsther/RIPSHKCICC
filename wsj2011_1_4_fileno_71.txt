A top-earning broker at one of New York's biggest residential real-estate firms is leaving to launch a Manhattan office for a Texas-based real-estate franchise company.

  Ilan Bracha, who won Prudential Douglas Elliman's 2009 team award for most gross-commission income, will run the New York office for Keller Williams.

Mr. Bracha said he felt the increase in public-listing information was leveling the playing field between powerhouse brokers and start-ups. The hiring was first reported in the Real Deal.

Last year, Douglas Elliman became the latest New York broker to launch a virtual-office website, where the firm for the first time listed not only its own properties but those of competitors.

Mr. Bracha already was enjoying an unusually high percentage of the commission split with Douglas Elliman, taking home 70% for him and his team. At his new firm, he starts at 70% but once he has paid $50,000 in commissions to Keller Williams, he and his agents keep all the commissions, Mr. Bracha said.

Mr. Bracha said every one of his 15 team members at Douglas Elliman is planning to join him at Keller Williams. He also is hoping to convince his listing owners. Mr. Bracha estimated he has sales listings totaling about $300 million. 

A Douglas Elliman spokeswoman said his 2010 commissions represented less than 1% of the firm's revenue. "We expect that many of his listings will stay" with the firm, she said. 

Douglas Elliman Chairman  Howard Lorber said he wished Mr. Bracha well, adding that "it's tough" in New York as a real-estate start-up.
