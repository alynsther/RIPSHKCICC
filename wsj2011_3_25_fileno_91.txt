Thanks to the success of the 'The King's Speech" and costume soap "Downton Abbey" (not to mention the upcoming royal wedding), British period pieces are experiencing a surge of popularity. Now enter the grand dame of all British society dramas, the 1971-1975 series "Upstairs, Downstairs," all dressed up in a 40th Anniversary Edition DVD set with 21 discs and 25 hours of never-before-seen extras. Not part of this package: a three-hour "Upstairs" revival that debuted on the BBC in December and will air on PBS next month; six more hours are expected to be ready in 2012.

Seen by over one billion people in 40 countries worldwide, the original "Upstairs, Downstairs" followed the private lives of the London-based Bellamy family and the servants that waited on them. Beginning in 1903, the residents of 165 Eaton Place persevere through the First World War, the 1918 flu pandemic, and other historical events up until 1930. The updated version picks up six years later.

Period dramas resonate for a wide range of reasons, to hear two "Upstairs" veterans theorize. "Audiences like looking at the fairly-near past, because we've solved everything—we won the wars, we cured diseases, education got broader," says Jean Marsh, who co-created the original series with Eileen Atkins and reprises her Emmy-winning role of Rose Buck in the new version. "In terms of specifically bringing back the show, the most important elements were keeping: the title, the theme music and the address, and using Rose as a bridge between the shows."

Lesley-Anne Down, who played Georgina Worsley on the original series, says the world of "Upstairs" is comforting compared with today—or the early 1970s, a bleak period in Britain. "We like going back to a time when human begins were in control, and life and politics were comparatively simple," she says.
