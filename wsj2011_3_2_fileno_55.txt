The 100-seat elegant dining room of Junoon seems fit for the maharajah. 



This new upscale Flatiron restaurant is one of several restaurants trying to take Indian food to new levels with upscale digs and formal service. 

The portions are dainty and French-like for the three-course prix fixe ($25). To start, diners can chose from a lentil dish, paneer (homemade cheese), a chicken curry and crispy cauliflower shaded a lovely crimson. 

Main courses include a choice of a chicken or lamb-shoulder curry, or the recommended Kashmiri lotus root with cheese, cashew nuts and cardamom. Dessert is chocolate cheesecake or a tiny cube of cardamom kulfi (Indian ice-cream) that will leave you wanting more.

Other lunch options include vegetable biryani ($18) or chicken biryani ($21), a rice dish, or a vegetarian thali ($24), a meal that includes several proteins, vegetables, raita (yogurt sauce), rice and bread.
