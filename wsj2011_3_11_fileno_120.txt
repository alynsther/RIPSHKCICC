There are 17 Democratic senators up for re-election next year, and several of them from GOP-leaning states are clearly nervous about being seen as joining President Obama and liberal Congressional leaders in opposing spending cuts.

West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin, a former Democratic governor of his state, gave voice to those frustrations this week in a remarkable floor speech in which he accused the president of failing to exercise leadership over the national debt while simultaneously slamming Republicans for "unrealistic" budget proposals.

"Why are we doing all this when the most powerful person in these negotiations—our president—has failed to lead this debate or offer a serious proposal for spending and cuts that he would be willing to fight for?" Mr. Manchin asked.

He announced that he will vote against both the proposal by Senate Democrats to cut a mere $10.6 billion in federal spending and the GOP-backed package of $61 billion in cuts. "Respectfully," Mr. Manchin said, "I am asking President Obama to take this challenge head on and propose a compromise plan for dealing with the our nation's fiscal challenges." 

The White House declined to respond to Mr. Manchin, but it has to be worried that other Democratic senators will join his rebellion. Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill, who is also up for re-election in 2012, said the Senate Democratic leadership's plan "doesn't go as far as we need to go" in deficit reduction. Democratic Senators in red states are increasingly showing little hesitancy in distancing themselves from President Obama, while at the same time they can selectively oppose GOP budget cuts to prevent their liberal base from accusing them of too much disloyalty.
