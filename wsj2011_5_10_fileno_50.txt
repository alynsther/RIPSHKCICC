WELLINGTON—New Zealand Finance Minister  Bill English said Tuesday that the government's May 19 budget will rein in the deficit and set a credible path back to surplus.

Earlier Tuesday, the Treasury said the government's core operating deficit for the nine months to March 31 was higher than it had forecast in December, under the impact of the Feb. 22 earthquake in the nation's second-largest city, Christchurch.



The Treasury said the core deficit—operating balance excluding gains and losses—for the period totaled 10.17 billion New Zealand dollars (US$8.08 billion), 15% larger than the NZ$8.86 billion forecast in its half-yearly financial update. That deficit includes the Earthquake Commission's NZ$1.5 billion estimated share of costs for the earthquake in Christchurch.

Mr. English said that next week's budget will confirm a very large deficit for the current year, including the immediate costs of rebuilding Christchurch, but "will also confirm significant improvements in the fiscal position over the next few years, before we return to surplus and start repaying debt."

The government's bottom-line deficit was NZ$3.3 billion, against a forecast deficit of NZ$7.18 billion. The Treasury said it was narrowed by gains on investments and derivatives held by the New Zealand Superannuation Fund and the Accident Compensation Corp. and actuarial gains on ACC and government superannuation-fund liabilities.

Net debt, at NZ$39.4 billion—20.2% of gross domestic product—was NZ$174 million less than forecast.
