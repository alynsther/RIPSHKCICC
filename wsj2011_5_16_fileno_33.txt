ISLAMABAD â€“ Pakistan has agreed to return the tail section of a U.S. helicopter used in the raid that killed Osama bin Laden earlier this month.

Sen. John Kerry, who met Monday with senior Pakistani civilian and military officials in Islamabad, said the gesture was among a number of steps both countries had agreed to take to rebuild shattered relations.

Pakistan is angered over the unilateral raid that targeted bin Laden in Abbottabad, a military garrison town 40 miles from Islamabad.

The U.S. wants Pakistan to do more to clamp down on militant groups that use Pakistan as a sanctuary to launch attacks on U.S. forces in Afghanistan. 

Sen. Kerry did not disclose what other steps the two countries had agreed to take.

Getting the helicopter back is crucial for the U.S. which was concerned about sensitive military technology ending up in the hands of China, Pakistan's ally.

The helicopter, one of four used in the night-time raid, suffered a hard landing during the operation. The U.S. special forces who conducted the raid blew up the helicopter before leaving. The tail section was blown on to a wall of bin Laden's compound.
