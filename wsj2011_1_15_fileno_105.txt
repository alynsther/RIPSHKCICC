Booksellers were caught short this week when Clare Vanderpool won the most prestigious award in American children's literature, the Newbery Medal. Her funny and affecting first novel has been out since September, but while it had sold well in Kansas—the home of both the author and her fictional heroine, Abilene—the book had yet to build a national following. The Newbery imprimatur means that it will win readers now, and justly so, for despite some narrative quirks, "Moon Over Manifest" is a charmer: a multigenerational epic populated by orphans and immigrants, hobos and bootleggers, scalawags and con men and small-town citizens with brave hearts. The story begins in 1936, when 12-year-old Abilene Tucker jumps off a train just outside Manifest, Kan. After years of riding the rails with her drifter father, Gideon, Abilene knows that "it's best to get a look at a place before it gets a look at you." The girl is supposed to spend the summer in Manifest, where her father spent some years as a boy, while he works a railroad job, but she isn't happy about it. For one thing, the town is dusty and neglected, nothing like the vibrant place her father described. For another, some mysterious sadness has taken hold of him. 

 By Clare Vanderpool  Delacorte, 368 pages, $16.99

Abilene decides to hunt for clues to her father's melancholy by poking around in his past. Not only does she discover a stack of old newspapers and a cigar box filled with letters and mementoes but she also befriends a mystic who helps her unfold what happened in Manifest in the crucial years of 1917 and 1918. Leavened by Abilene's dry wit, this sometimes heart-rending story moves us back and forth in time between the Depression and the town as it was during World War I. "The person you encounter is often more than the person you see," the mystic warns Abilene. As readers ages 10-15 will discover, this turns out to be true for almost everyone in "Moon Over Manifest."
