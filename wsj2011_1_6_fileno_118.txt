KABULâ€”Suspected Taliban fighters attacked an Afghan tribal leader who days ago agreed to help coalition forces crack down on insurgents in a volatile district of southern Afghanistan, tribal elders said.

The attack left Haji Sayed Badaar Agha, a leader of the Alikozai tribe in the violence-wracked Sangin district of Helmand province, in critical condition, the elders said. 

Mr. Agha "came under attack by gunmen while he traveled to a mosque for morning prayers on Tuesday," said Haji Abdul Hay Khan, a tribal elder from Sangin, in a telephone interview. The coalition said it was monitoring the situation but couldn't confirm reports of the attack.

Mr. Agha's tribe agreed Saturday to try to halt insurgent attacks and expel foreign militants from Sangin in exchange for foreign aid money.

Coalition forces hope the agreement with the Alikozai could provide a model for other areas, taking the pressure off allied and Afghan forces.

But some coalition officials have played down expectations for the deal, noting that the Alikozai in Sangin are one of three tribes from the area that have provided support and manpower for the Taliban. The other tribes aren't party to the deal.

Still, Mr. Khan said foreign insurgents from Pakistan had gunned down Mr. Agha, not local militants, who are "cooperating" with tribal leaders.

Taliban spokesman Qari Yusuf Ahmadi denied the group attacked Mr. Agha. In a telephone interview, he labeled the news propaganda that was intended to "defame" the insurgency.

International troops have faced stiff resistance from militants in Sangin, with a quarter of Britain's 349 fatalities during the nine-year war coming in the district. It was handed over to U.S. forces in September.
