LONDONâ€”The U.K. has expelled two diplomats from the Libyan embassy in London for intimidating opposition supporters in Britain, a person familiar with the matter said. 

The Foreign & Commonwealth Office announced it had expelled the diplomats but declined to specify why.

"I ordered the expulsion of the two diplomats on the basis that their activities were contrary to the interests of the U.K.," Foreign Secretary William Hague said. 

"I judged that the behavior of these individuals had become unacceptable, and that they should therefore be declared persona non grata," he said. 

The U.K. expelled four diplomats for similar reasons at the end of March and on Sunday expelled the ambassador after Britain's embassy in Libya was attacked. 

Libya continues to have a "handful" of diplomats at its London embassy, an FCO spokeswoman said. 

Separately, the British Navy said that one of its mine counter-measure vessels destroyed a mine laid by the forces of Col. Moammar Gadhafi a mile from the harbor entrance of Mistrata, the besieged port city in western Libya.

Forces loyal to Col. Gadhafi have made previous attempts to close down the port to limit the flow of humanitarian assistance to the population of Misrata. The mine, containing more than 100 kilograms of high explosives, had been "crudely placed" using an inflatable dinghy to transport it to sea, the Royal Navy said in a statement.
