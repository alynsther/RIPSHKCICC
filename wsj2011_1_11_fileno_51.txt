Investors said Monday's pullback was a natural reaction after the market's climb in the last quarter of 2010 stretched into last week. Portfolio managers also are waiting for earnings reports to revise their outlooks and see which sectors are poised to do well in the new year.

"Earnings in the first half of the year should be pretty good. I'm concerned a little bit about the second half," said  Richard Sherry, portfolio manager at Kayne Anderson Rudnick Investment Management. "Companies have been doing a good job of managing costs, but as we go through the year it will become more difficult," as investors watch to see which companies are exhibiting growth, he said.

With no U.S. economic data on Monday, many market watchers focused on Europe. The euro touched a four-month low against the dollar after German media reported over the weekend that France and Germany were pressuring Portugal to accept an Ireland-type bailout package from the International Monetary Fund and the European Union. Officials in Germany and France denied the report, but fears grew that Portugal and Spain could follow Greece and Ireland in requesting financial aid from international lenders.

"There are real questions about Europe and the prospects for the European economy in 2011â€”particularly when Europe is a very important export destination for the U.S.," said  Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer of Hugh Johnson Advisors. "If Europe has another sinking spell, then everybody's going to have to revisit their forecasts for 2011," he said. 

The euro was trading recently at $1.2952, up from $1.2910 in New York late Friday, after dealers said the European Central Bank stepped in with "aggressive" purchases of bonds issued by high-debt governments.
