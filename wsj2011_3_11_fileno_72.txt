Amid all the hoopla surrounding his contract negotiations and apparent propensity for building mansions, it's easy to forget that Derek Jeter is approaching perhaps the greatest individual accomplishment of his Hall of Fame career.

Jeter needs just 74 hits to become the 28th member of the vaunted 3,000-hit club, which should make Yankee games in mid-June the city's hottest tickets (even if they already were). And if history holds true, there's reason to believe Jeter will reach the milestone at home in New York, perhaps even against the Boston Red Sox.

It has taken Jeter an average of 63.43 games into the season to collect 74 hits. That means Jeter could reach the magic number at Yankee Stadium on either Thursday, June 9 against Boston or Friday, June 10 against Cleveland. This is important information for Yankees' fans, considering single-game tickets go on sale Friday. (In determining this average, we excluded 2003, when Jeter missed the first six weeks with a shoulder injury and took 94 games to reach that number.) 

Jeter's fastest push to 74 came in 1999, when he needed only 51 games to reach the mark. He finished that season with career highs in batting average (.349), hits (219), home runs (24) and RBIs (102). The slowest, besides 2003, was his rookie 1996 campaign. It took him 81 games.

Interestingly, last year—by all accounts his worst ever—Jeter got there in the 57th game, the fourth quickest pace in his career. No. 74 came on June 6. It was the last day all season he went to bed batting .300. 

A repeat of his 2010 pace this season would be bad news for hopeful Yankee fans: He would hit No. 3000 on the road against Oakland.

Derek Jeter is 74 hits from joining the 3,000 hit club. Here's a look at when in each of his seasons he recorded his 74th hit (excluding 2003 due to injury):
