Six years ago Tuesday, Robinson Cano made his major league debut against the Tampa Bay Rays as a highly-touted prospect who might be great if he could harness his tools. 

Six years later, according to the Elias Sports Bureau, Cano is one of only three active players who have 1,100 hits and 100 homers in their first six years in the league—the others being the peerless Albert Pujols and the once-great Todd Helton. 

His 1,100 hits are also the most by any player at second base for his first six years since the hit king, Pete Rose.

"I think you see a player that's matured into something special," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said.

When the Mets hosted the first baseball game in New York after September 11, it was part of the city's healing process. When they hosted the first game after the death of Osama bin Laden, it was a different scene entirely.

How does a baseball team celebrate the death of a national enemy?

The Mets did it by turning Tuesday's game against the San Francisco Giants into an unofficial military appreciation night. They donated 4,000 tickets for the game to military members and their families. 

Players wore special blue and white hats with stars and stripes woven into the interlocking NY. 

Osama bin Laden's name wasn't mentioned before the game. The theme of the night needed no explanation.
