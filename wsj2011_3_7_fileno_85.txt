When descending down to  David Burke Kitchen, you're greeted by a wood ceiling, denim booths, mossy green pillows and gingham napkins. But large photos featuring the restaurant's purveyors holding ducks, chickens or cows may catch you off guard. 

As to be expected in this SoHo/TriBeCa location, other patrons easily fit into the fashion and architecture surroundings.

Don't resist the olive or seven-grain bread; it's best to order one of the jars, such as the chicken liver/prune/pistachio ($7), to fully indulge. 

The presentation is right in line with  David Burke: theatrical, even amid a simple outdoors mentality. As you cut into the popular short rib and Camembert ravioli ($21), egg oozes out and drips into the ribs, making the dish both rich yet still well proportioned. 

And drop by the peanut-brittle jar on your way outâ€”the restaurant even supplies paper cones for carrying it.

 David Burke Kitchen, in the James Hotel, is at 23 Grand St. near Sixth Avenue and serves lunch 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Monday through Friday; 212-201-9119
