Grenache is a red grape that has a thin "slip skin" — that is, it slips off easily — and a meaty flesh, similar to a lychee. Its rich pulp builds a strong-bodied wine while the light tannins from the skin soften the texture. Indigenous to Spain, Grenache grapes have become popular to grow in Portugal, Australia and the southern Rhône Valley in France.

Think of candy. Because they are grown in warm climates, Grenache grapes are ripe and they produce ripe-flavored wines often laced with a cotton-candy-like sweetness. Make no mistake, however: Though it smells sugary and sweet, like a candied apple, Grenache is a dry wine, which in wine-speak means it has no sugar (all the sugar has been converted to alcohol).
