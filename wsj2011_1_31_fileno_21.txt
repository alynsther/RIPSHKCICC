  Tata Communications Ltd. Monday posted a consolidated third-quarter net loss of 1.97 billion rupees ($ 42.9 million) as a marginal rise in revenue failed to cushion it from the impact of rising costs. 

The undersea communication cable company reported a consolidated net profit of 301.8 million rupees in the year earlier October-December period. 

Consolidated revenue in the three-month period grew 8.9% to 30.18 billion rupees from 27.71 billion rupees. 

Total costs for the third quarter climbed to 30.93 billion rupees from 28.77 billion rupees. 

Companies such as Tata Communications have invested millions dollars to build and maintain undersea cables and network infrastructure, but have been bearing losses as global over capacity led to a decline in bandwidth prices even as costs rise. 

Network costs, which make up a bulk of the expenses, rose 9.5% to 18.20 billion rupees compared with 16.62 billion rupees a year earlier. 

Tata Communications' other income rose 67.7% year-on-year to 690.2 million rupees and included a foreign exchange gain of 81.3 million rupees. A year earlier it posted a foreign exchange loss of 181.1 million rupees.
