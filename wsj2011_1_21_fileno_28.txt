NEW DELHI --The follow-on public offering of state-run explorer Oil & Natural Gas Corp. will take place on schedule in March, Oil Secretary S. Sundareshan said Friday.

"There is absolutely no reason to doubt that the FPO (follow-on offer) will not take place in the current financial year. It is proceeding according to plan, which is by March-end," Mr. Sundareshan told reporters.

India's federal government, which owns 74.14% of ONGC, plans to sell a 5% stake in the company via the offering to raise as much as $3 billion-$4 billion.
