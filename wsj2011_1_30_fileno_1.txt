NEW DELHIâ€”India will charge mobile telephone operators a market-determined fee for the bandwidth they hold beyond the limit as mentioned in their licenses, as part of a new telecom policy, the federal telecommunications minister said Saturday. 

Licenses to offer telecom services will now be given without the bandwidth, and companies will be allowed to offer any kind of telecommunication services under a single license, the minister,  Kapil Sibal, told reporters, outlining the broad contours of the forthcoming telecom policy. 

Mr. Sibal's comments come at a time when India's federal investigating agency is probing a controversial 2008 allotment of mobile-phone licenses and spectrum. 

Investigators are scrutinizing the government's 2008 sale of mobile-phone frequencies to several companies, a process that critics say favored some firms and which a government auditor says cost India up to $40 billion in lost revenue by pricing spectrum far below its market value. 

The scandal over the license and bandwidth allotment prompted the resignation of Andimuthu Raja as telecom minister in November and Mr. Sibal took over.
