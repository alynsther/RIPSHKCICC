WASHINGTON—U.S. Sen. Richard Durbin, the second-ranking Democrat in the Senate, on Wednesday said it is unlikely a resolution raising the nation's debt ceiling can pass without some accompanying action showing Congress is serious about long-term debt reduction.

Treasury has said it will hit the debt limit no later than May 16. But Mr. Durbin (D., Ill.) said the Treasury has told Congress that July 8 is the latest the debt ceiling can be raised to allow the government to continue borrowing to pay its bills. Many Democrats have been calling for Congress to pass before then a "clean" debt-ceiling measure that simply raises the ceiling without having other actions attached to the legislation.

But Mr. Durbin, speaking at a Bloomberg News breakfast, said the political reality is that—particularly in the Republican-controlled House—some measure toward deficit reduction will be needed to get a debt-ceiling increase passed. 

"I think in order to get House approval of the debt ceiling there will have to be something agreed upon," he said.

Mr. Durbin wasn't specific about what that something might be, but he noted that congressional consideration of a new budget resolution for fiscal 2012 will be proceeding at the same time, suggesting that measure might provide the evidence of deficit action conservatives are seeking.

In any case, Mr. Durbin said he doesn't want Congress to wait until the debt-ceiling deadline before acting. "Even the threat of default on our debt" will unsettle markets, he said.

Mr. Durbin, who is close to President Barack Obama, said he didn't know details of the speech the president will give later Wednesday on his thoughts on deficit reduction but said "he will lay out in clear terms what he thinks need to be the key elements" of a deficit-cutting plan.
