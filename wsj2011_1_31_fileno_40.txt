NEW DELHI -- India Monday raised its economic growth estimate for the last financial year ended March 31, 2010 to 8%, strengthening expectations that Asia's third-largest economy is firmly back on track to expand at a pre-crisis pace.

The revision of real economic growth from 7.4% was due to tweaks in data to reflect a change in the way inflation is calculated, the government said in a statement.

India in August shifted the base year to calculate its main inflation gauge--the Wholesale Price Index, or WPI--to 2004-05 from 1993-94.

"The revision in estimates is also on account of use of latest available data on agricultural production, industrial production, government expenditure and also detailed and more comprehensive data available from various source agencies," the statement added.

The revision comes after the government raised the economic growth forecast for the current financial year to 8.75% from 8.5% last month.

This financial year's growth forecast could even top 9%--the average rate in the four years until March 2008, before the economic crisis unfolded--even as advanced economies struggle to exit a prolonged slowdown, the government had said.

However, uncertainty over Europe's debt crisis poses a risk to the forecast as the government said actual growth could vary 0.35 of a percentage point from the estimate. The previous forecast had factored in up to a 0.25 percentage point deviation from 8.5%.

India's economy expanded 8.9% in the first half of the current financial year and the government expects the pace to accelerate in the second half.

However, high inflation--despite some recent easing--fueled by red-hot food prices threatens to stunt the economic recovery. The WPI rose 8.43% in December from a year earlier, quicker than November's provisional 7.48%.
