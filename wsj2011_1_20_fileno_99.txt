 Q: Over the past few years, I have lost nearly 100 pounds. I have spent a small fortune replacing my suits from a size 48 to a size 40—albeit with pleasure. For casual wear, I bought a number of shirts with a 15-inch neck that fit great through the body, but I still need a 17-inch neck size—like my old shirts—so I can comfortably wear them with a tie. The problem is that these shirts are so baggy in the body that they ruin the look of my trim-fit new suits. Would it be practical to have a tailor somehow taper them to get of their bagginess?

A: Instead of having your larger suits remade, you resolved to spring for new ones. You might as well replace your baggy shirts, too. While a skilled tailor may be able to trim down your old shirts, he will probably charge you dearly (more than $25 a shirt) to do so. And there's no guarantee that the altered shirts will fit perfectly. 

If you insist on trying, give your tailor just one shirt, to see how well it turns out.

Bottom line: I think you should avoid trial and error and reward yourself with some brand-new shirts in the latest slim-fitting cut. 

And if you're really persnickety, consider a few made-to-order custom shirts. They will probably cost you at least $130 apiece, but they will deliver the maximum in comfort and appearance. Just flash back to all those years when you were too heavy to really enjoy clothes. It's fair to assume that you're overdue for a fashion splurge.

Still, don't be too eager to build your wardrobe during a single shopping spree. Take the time to get used to your new weight and to learn which cuts and silhouettes look the best on you now. 

As for your older, fuller shirts, if they aren't too oversized, you can turn them into shirt jackets by wearing them as a loose layer over a T-shirt or even a cotton V-neck sweater. Or just donate them to charity.
