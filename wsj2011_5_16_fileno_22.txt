Declaring that "all the factors say go, but my heart says no," Mike Huckabee announced Saturday that he will not run for president in 2012. He said the decision had been a tortuous one, but few political observers were surprised by the outcome. A more challenging puzzle is figuring out who benefits from his absence.

Given Mr. Huckabee's ideological profile, the obvious answer would seem to be a fellow social conservative: former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, perhaps, or former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum. That theory assumes that Mr. Huckabee's supporters will break mostly in one direction, but it's conceivable that they will instead splinter into several of camps.

Another potential beneficiary is Mr. Huckabee's arch-nemesis, Mitt Romney. With Mr. Huckabee out of the race, Mr. Romney could be more viable in otherwise unwinnable states like Iowa and South Carolina if the remaining social conservatives candidates split the vote.

There's also the chance that Mr. Huckabee could back one of the moderates. Possible candidates like Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels and former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman are expected to encounter skepticism from social conservatives, but the support of Mr. Huckabee could provide them with cover.
