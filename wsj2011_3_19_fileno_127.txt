Yes, there is the iPhone and the iPod Touch, but with 32GB memories that top out at about 750 albums, they just don't cut it for serious record collections. With 160GB of hard-drive space, the iPod Classic can hold around 3,200 albums, making it the only choice for the kind of collector who needs to switch from Lady Gaga to "Lady Day" and all genres and subgenres, and sub-subgenres, in between. It won't let you check your email, buy more tunes on the fly or check sports scores, but in this multitasking era of tweets, Facebook feeds and other instant distractions, there's something appealing about a device that does one thing well: rock out.
