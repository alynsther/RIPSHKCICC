The timing of the LPGA's first U.S. tournament of 2011 couldn't be better, given that the entire $1 million purse will go to charity, not to the players. The top 10 finishers at this week's RR Donnelley LPGA Founders Cup in Phoenix can designate a charity to receive their share. Paula Creamer and World No. 1 Yani Tseng of Taiwan have already picked relief efforts in Japan. Commissioner Michael Whan conceived the event to honor the Tour's 13 founders and "to make a statement about the Tour's spirit."

In his first U.S. appearance in seven months, Sergio Garcia blistered the Innisbrook course at the PGA Tour's Transitions Championship with a bogey-free 66, following Thursday's bogey-free 68. Following a protracted slump, the former world No. 2 took a break from golf last summer to regain his enthusiasm. Bonus fact: He got stung by a bee on the 14th hole—in the hand—to no ill effect.
