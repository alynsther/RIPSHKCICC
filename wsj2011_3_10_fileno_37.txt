Amrutanjan Health Care Ltd. plans to acquire the soft-drink and fruit beverage businesses of Siva's Soft Drink Pvt. Ltd. for 262 million rupees. 

The acquisition will also include the transfer of the brand Fruitnik, the company told stock exchanges early Thursday.

Fruitnik, a pulp-based flavoured fruit drink, was established in 1958 and is a well-known brand in south India. 

This acquisition is in line with the company's strategy of getting into the food and beverage business. 

In an earnings conference call, the company said it is planning to grow its food and healthcare businesses beyond its home market in Tamil Nadu. 

The 118-year-old, Chennai-based company is known for selling Amrutanjan pain-relief balm. It also manufactures healthcare, food and medical care products. 

Amrutanjan shares rose on news of the acquisition plan, trading up 9.62% at 635 rupees at 0830 GMT on the Bombay Stock Exchange, where the market was down 0.34%. 

Although Amrutanjan's revenue for the third quarter ended Dec. 31 rose to 342.2 million rupees from 273.8 million rupees a year earlier, net profit dropped 35.3% to 32 million rupees from 31.4 million rupees.
