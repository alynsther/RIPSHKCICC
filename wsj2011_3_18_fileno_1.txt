 said Friday it has decided to acquire at least 50% of the shares it does not already own in its subsidiary Atlas Copco (India) Ltd, and will apply for the delisting of its shares from Indian exchanges.

-This investment is in line with the Group's policy of having wholly owned foreign subsidiaries, and offers us greater operational flexibility in India," said  Hans Ola Meyer, CFO of Atlas Copco.

-Atlas Copco will submit an application for delisting to the Bombay Stock Exchange and the Pune Stock Exchange.

-Upon approval, all remaining public shareholders in Atlas Copco (India) Limited will have an option to divest their shares to Atlas Copco at 2,750 rupees a share for the coming 12 months.
