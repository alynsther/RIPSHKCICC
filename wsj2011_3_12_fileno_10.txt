WASHINGTON â€“ U.S. President Barack Obama said Saturday he is still fighting for legislation to target wage discrimination against women and pointed to a government report on the status of women in the U.S. 

"Today, women still earn on average only about 75 cents for every dollar a man earns. That's a huge discrepancy," Mr. Obama said in his weekly radio address, noting that March is women's history month. 

Mr. Obama said he still wants to pass reforms in the Paycheck Fairness Act, a bill aimed at stamping out wage discrimination based on workers' sex that failed to garner enough support to pass in the Senate last fall. 

He also highlighted a report out last week that compiled government statistics that show women have made strides in certain realms, but also included what the president called "reminders of how much work remains to be done." 

Those reminders include the greater likelihood that women will live in poverty in the U.S. and the lack of women in certain fields like math and engineering, Mr. Obama said. 

"This is especially troubling, for we know that to compete with nations around the world, these are the fields in which we need to harness the talents of all our people. That's how we'll win the future," Mr. Obama said. 

The president also noted the "positive news" in the report, like the fact that women are now more likely than men to attend and graduate from college. 

"We have to work even harder to close the gaps that still exist, and to uphold that simple American ideal: we are all equal and deserving of the chance to pursue our own version of happiness," he said.
