Chef Geoffrey Zakarian's latest venture, The National at the Benjamin Hotel, reunites him with Paul Corsentino, his executive sous chef at Country. At the glossy, but unpretentious spot—meant to be a neighborhood joint in a part of town that rarely feels like a neighborhood—the two have created a menu of "inventive bistro food." "A customer wants to recognize what they're eating, but also be slightly surprised at how good the quality and presentation is," Mr. Zakarian said. 



A recent visit started with fat pillows of gnocchi, dreamily rich with mushrooms and parmesan, plus watercress for bite ($12); and mussels in lobster broth, with orange, basil and a saffron crouton ($12). Order a side of fries (with smoked paprika, $6) if you're after that moules et frites feeling, or splurge and go for the steak frites (sirloin, with mizuna and red wine sauce, $26). 

For something lighter, try the popular chicken salad, with couscous, radish, mango, carrots and mustard greens ($15). The meringue napoleon, with grapefruit, buttermilk custard and Campari syrup ($9), provides an airy , sweet-tart finish.
