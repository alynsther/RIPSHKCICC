**DOES WINE ALWAYS** improve with age? In most cases the answer is probably no. Outside of the rarefied world of fine wine—as shorthand that includes anything above £10 a bottle—it's safe to assume you can take your wine home and pull the cork, or twist the screw cap. 

When this subject comes up, I am reminded of the words of one of my first wine
mentors, who, on the topic of decanting, would emphasize that most wines are
designed to be drunk straight away, saying that an awful lot of effort went
into producing that sort of style too.

#### Drinking Now: Three Young Wines

Pinot Grigio is the grape variety critics love to hate. Will Lyons disagrees,
in the right hands it can be one of the most pleasurable summer wines you can
find.

These are styles of wines that aren't enormously serious, in that they don't
have a huge range of flavors. (A shorthand for this category, suggested by
Charles Lea, owner of London fine wine merchant Lea & Sandeman, is "anything
you can drink out of an ice bucket," which includes a variety of reds as well
as whites.) That isn't to deride these wines in any way. It is as legitimate
to appreciate an uncomplicated style of white wine, designed to refresh and be
sipped without too much thought, as it is to purr enthusiastically over the
grandeur of a classed growth Bordeaux. In that vein, let's celebrate this
expression of youth.

The obvious place to start is with white wine, as the vast majority are best
drunk within a year of the harvest—although the later bottlings always tend to
taste a little better. Sauvignon Blanc, Vinho Verde, Moscato, Pinot Grigio and
Picpoul de Pinet are the best candidates for "better when young."

One wine that is absolutely made for this time of year is France's Condrieu,
made from the Viognier grape. Wine writer  Hugh Johnson likened its smell to
that of a "garden of unknown flowers." You can find Viognier now planted all
over the world, particularly in Australia and California, and I always find it
is best drunk young. Chenin Blanc, dry Riesling and Argentina's Torrontés can
also bypass the cellar, as can almost any rosé.

With red wines, the choices aren't as obvious. As a rule of thumb, anything
heavy with lots of tannin, like Cabernet Sauvignon, Barolo or a heavy Merlot,
improves with time in the bottle. Italy's soft, fruity Dolcetto; straight
Beaujolais, by which I mean Nouveau and Beaujolais-Villages (not Cru
Beaujolais); and anything made with the Gamay grape are good to go from the
off.

I would also look to France's Loire Valley, in particular its Cabernet Franc,
which can be enjoyed young. For a more interesting youthful wine, try
Lambrusco. No, not the undistinguished white wine but Italy's gently
sparkling, dark cherry red wine, which is wonderful with cold meats and
certain cheeses. Most wines made with Barbera and Sangiovese (the main grape
variety of Chianti) have more grip when tasted young, which makes them ideal
when drinking with food.

Of course, generalizations are always fraught with anomalies and it goes
without saying, trust your own palate. The English are famed for cellaring
their wines much longer than their Gallic cousins, who prefer them in the
first flush of youth. Me? I enjoy both.

SEOUL—South Korean President Park Geun-hye on Friday replaced nearly half of
her cabinet ministers, including the finance minister, in her latest attempt
to recover from public criticism of the government's handling of the recent
ferry disaster and to kick-start her economic plans.

The president's office said seven of 17 total cabinet ministers would be
replaced in the first major government shuffle since the president took
office...

Discover Financial Services agreed to enhance its procedures for preventing
money laundering under a pact with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the
credit-card lender said Friday.

The Riverwoods, Ill., company said it would put in place a revised Bank
Secrecy Act compliance program under the agreement. Discover, which didn't
admit or deny any charges of unsound banking practices, won't pay any fines as
part of the agreement.

LONDON—The first British solo exhibition of paintings by Russian artist Viktor
Popkov is being held at Somerset House, a palatial gallery overlooking the
River Thames, thanks to an unlikely backer, London's Science Museum, and the
arcane practice of immunity from seizure.

The Popkov show "has nothing to do with science," concedes Zelfira Tregulova,
the director general of Moscow's State Museum Exhibition Center, known as
Rosizo, which helped set up the exhibition along with Andrey Filatov, a
railroad magnate and...

**THANKS TO** preservation efforts and the museum-building boom of the past decade, America's hot zone for modern and contemporary architecture is still the Midwest. And driving is the best way to see it all, including the star attraction, Chicago. "It's the birthplace of tall buildings," said Zoë Ryan, an architecture and design curator at the Art Institute of Chicago. "You can't come here and not go on a [Chicago Architecture Foundation] boat tour," she added. A U.K. native, Ms. Ryan credits émigrés from Europe, especially ones associated with the Bauhaus, and enlightened patrons and natives such as Wisconsinite Frank Lloyd Wright with setting the bar "very, very high" from Cleveland to Milwaukee. Here's an itinerary that blends past and present.

**1\. Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland** // Cleveland

Iranian-born architect Farshid Moussavi completed this four-story faceted
geometric glass structure, the award-winning designer's first U.S. commission,
in 2012. Because it's covered mostly in panels of mirror-finished stainless
steel, its appearance shifts with the light. Ms. Moussavi could take liberties
with the design since the museum, one of the few major non-collecting
institutions in the States, has no permanent galleries. The result is a
building designed for maximum flexibility with entrances on all four sides. _

**2\. Toledo Museum of Art Glass Pavilion** // Toledo, Ohio

The Glass Pavilion by Pritzker Prize-winning Japanese firm SANAA—who also
built New York's dramatically off-kilter New Museum—opened to critical acclaim
in 2006. Its maze of undulating, clear glass walls, which themselves can
support no weight, is a nod not only to the vast collection of glass pieces
within, but to Toledo's history as a major innovator of the material. With on-
site working furnaces, the staff offers introductory, hands-on glass workshops
and free daily demonstrations. _
[toledomuseum.org](http://www.toledomuseum.org/) _

**3\. Contemporary Arts Center** // Cincinnati

The first major American museum designed by a woman, the CAC's Rosenthal
Center, by London-based architect Zaha Hadid, reinvigorated the institution in
2003. Visitors to the corner building—a puzzle of bold, interlocking
rectangular volumes—enter through glass walls at street level to find a
freestanding black staircase slicing through space next to a massive curved
concrete wall that evokes a skateboard halfpipe. Ms. Hadid called the wall her
"urban carpet," designed to welcome the city's diverse population._

Miller House Leslie Williamson

Built by industrialist and major architectural patron J. Irwin Miller, this
midcentury landmark, designed by a dream team including architect Eero
Saarinen, is the epitome of an open-plan home—conversation pit and
all—surrounded by meticulously maintained gardens. Since the passing of Mr.
Miller's wife in 2008, the 6,838-square-foot residence has been owned by the
Indianapolis Museum of Art (IMA) and open for tours. The house is 50 miles
from the IMA building, and visitors must arrive at a visitor's center to be
escorted via shuttle to the site. _ [imamuseum.org](http://www.imamuseum.org/)

Farnsworth House Alamy

Philip Johnson's 1949 Glass House may have been completed first, but this was
the original. A prime example of minimalistic midcentury architecture that
fuses modernity with nature, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's elevated, glass-walled
1951 Farnsworth house was originally designed as a summer home. It's now
operated by the National Trust, and visitors can reserve advance tickets
online to tour the secluded structure, which sits on idyllic grounds
surrounded by woods. _ [farnsworthhouse.org](http://farnsworthhouse.org/) _

**6\. Emil Bach House and City Tour** // Chicago

The Chicago Architecture Foundation (architecture.org) operates dozens of
tours throughout the city that cater to various design tastes. The Art
Institute's Ms. Ryan suggested the River Cruise, which runs multiple times a
day during the summer, including weekends. If you're staying overnight in
Chicago, you can rent one of two upper-floor guest rooms at the recently
reopened 1915 Emil Bach House, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright in his Prairie
style, except for Wednesdays when it's open for ticketed tours. _

Milwaukee Art Museum Raymond Meier/Trunk Archive

This institution delivers a one-two punch of architectural styles. Its 1957
War Memorial Center, a brutalist showpiece by Eero Saarinen, is paired with
2001's gleaming-white Quadracci Pavilion by Spanish innovator  Santiago
Calatrava. The Pavilion was designed to house public and event spaces, and
it's capped with a pair of steel wings spanning 217 feet. Head outside at noon
to see the wings open and close. _ [mam.org](http://mam.org/) _

_Pinehurst, N.C._

Even after Thursday's opening round at the U.S. Open here, players were still
saying that a few strokes under par would be good enough to win. Before the
tournament, some were even suggesting that an over-par total might win.
Martin Kaymer, for example, predicted on Wednesday that if he or anyone else
shot eight over par they could win it all.

"I wouldn't take it anymore, obviously," Kaymer said Friday after his second
consecutive, five-under-par 65. His 130 total is the lowest 36-hole score in
U.S. Open history. By finishing at 10 under par, six strokes ahead of his
nearest challenger,  Brendon Todd, Kaymer also tied the record for the largest
lead halfway through an Open. Tiger Woods in 2000 and Rory McIlroy in 2011
also led by six after 36 holes and went on to runaway victories. Kevin Na and
Brandt Snedeker, at three under par, were a shot behind Todd.

How could the notoriously difficult Pinehurst No. 2 course have played so much
easier than expected? It didn't, really, except for Kaymer. Despite an inch of
rain Thursday night that softened Pinehurst No. 2's famously hard-to-hold
greens, only 12 players besides Kaymer were under par after the second round.

Remove Kaymer from the mix, and the leaderboard would be one for the ages.
Among the five players tied at two under par were  Dustin Johnson, Henrik
Stenson and Keegan Bradley. Rory McIlroy, Matt Kuchar and Jordan Spieth stood
at one under par, a shot ahead of Adam Scott, Ian Poulter and Hideki Matsuyama
at even par. Justin Rose and Steve Stricker were another shot behind.

Phil Mickelson, it should be noted, shot 73 on Friday to finish at three over
par. With a good weekend, he could conceivably wind up in second place at a
U.S. Open again, improving his dubious record in that regard from six to
seven.

Kaymer logged five birdies and no bogeys Friday, and some of his shots were so
good they surprised even him. On the fourth hole, after hitting a towering,
right-to-left drawing six-iron from 211 yards to 12 feet from the hole, he
turned to his caddie in the fairway and said, "That's quite nice that
happened." Kaymer feels a lot less comfortable drawing the ball than with his
customary left-to-right fade. "A couple of those things happened today. I
don't know what to say. It's just very, very solid," he said.

After beating Bubba Watson in a playoff to win the 2010 PGA Championship at
Whistling Straits, Kaymer briefly rose to No. 1 in the world. But in an effort
shortly thereafter to switch from his reliable fade to a draw, his game
imploded. By earlier this year, his ranking had sunk to 63.

He read some of the "annoying" criticism which ensued. "I knew what I am
doing, I had a lot of trust in the people that I work with, and there was
never any stress," he said.

Eventually the small changes took hold (he is sticking with a go-to fade). At
the 2012 Ryder Cup, the German, now 29 years old, made the putt that clinched
victory for the European side, which bolstered his confidence, and last month
won the Players Championship, which he said Friday he considers a major, with
some clutch play down the stretch.

Kaymer is a tough closer, and he'll be prepared if he doesn't sustain his
torrid pace. "It's very, very difficult to play four rounds of great golf," he
said. "But then it becomes really important that you stay with it and accept a
couple of bogeys here and there, and don't shoot yourself out of the
tournament and don't get mad at yourself and that you don't compare [with
earlier rounds]. The comparing is, I think, the biggest mistake can you do."

The only person to squander a four-stroke lead after 36 holes in the U.S. Open
was Tom McNamara in 1909, after he got heatstroke on the final day. Still,
Pinehurst's greens are treacherous and confidence is a fragile commodity. Lou
Graham came from 11 strokes behind at the halfway point to win the 1975 Open.

If Kaymer does run away with the Open this weekend, NBC won't be happy, but
one thing that might be worth sticking around for is the network's signoff
Sunday evening—the network's last after 20 consecutive years of broadcasting
the Open. In a deal completed last summer, Fox Sports will pay just short of
$90 million a year—more than twice as much as under the current contract—to
broadcast the Open and other USGA events. Fox has tapped Joe Buck and  Greg
Norman as the lead announcers.

That means we've heard the last of  Johnny Miller's insightful, acerbic
commentary about his favorite event. Miller's final-round 63 in winning the
1973 Open at Oakmont was the highlight of his Hall-of-Fame career. NBC's
longtime golf producer Tommy Roy said last week the network is "preparing a
good way to go off the air" but wouldn't offer specifics. One thing is for
sure: Miller will be emotional.

NBC and Miller won't be leaving golf altogether. The network will still
broadcast PGA Tour events, including the Players Championship, as well as the
Ryder Cup.

The network will stay in Pinehurst to broadcast next week's U.S. Women's Open.
Roy and the USGA believe it may be one of the most-watched women's events
ever. That was the USGA's primary stated reason for staging back-to-back men's
and women's Opens on the same course. The women's game, with popular players
like world No. 1 Stacy Lewis, 19-year-old Lexi Thompson and a resurgent
Michelle Wie, is as strong as it's ever been. Watching them battle the same
greens as the men will be a kick.

You are SO right Ross.  I watch most of it with the mute on.   Kaymer should
win easily tomorrow because no one else is playing well ……. he certainly is.
Just something strange about him.   Not fun to watch.  Most boring Open I have
ever watched in decades!   Also the lovely sand they planted over the rough
they removed has made the course much easier.   Still…..borrrriiing!

What is boring is the unrelenting commentary.  Half the field is on the course
as I type this.  Instead of following their play we get rehashing of the last
two days, human interest pieces, and little tidbits like the fact that Kaymer
ate barbecue at the Outback.  Really?  Eating barbecue at the Outback when in
North Carolina. What a waste of a great culinary opportunity.

The announcers are going to have to work very hard this weekend to make this
tourney interesting.  Kaymer is basically ruining the fun.  I was already
tired of him from the Players.  Here we go again.  Borrriiing!!

_São Paulo_

If 31 teams arrived in Brazil terrified of the home team, the Brazilians did
plenty to assuage their fears in the opening match of the 2014 World Cup.

In a lackluster performance that offered little of the artistry that has made
this team the envy of the world for 70 years, the Brazilians notched a 3-1 win
over a hard-luck Croatian side.

Six goals and what they show about team strategy: ** [National Teams' Styles
](http://graphicsweb.wsj.com/documents/wc-goals/) **

A goal on a penalty kick by Neymar, his second goal of the match, was the
turning point on a tense night for the hosts. Just when it seemed that Croatia
might survive with a draw, defender Dejan Lovren was whistled for dragging
down Brazil's striker Fred 8 yards from the goal.

It was a highly questionable call. Lovren had two hands on him, but Fred
appeared to exaggerate the contact.

Referee Yuichi Nishimura of Japan immediately pointed to the spot and didn't
waver even after a half dozen Croatians swarmed him. A minute later, Neymar's
kick skittered through the hands of Croatia's Stipe Pletikosa, and Brazil had
the lead.

Croatia coach Niko Kovac called the penalty "ridiculous."

"The referee was completely out of his depth," he said. "Everybody saw this
was not a penalty." The coach pointed out that Fred weighs nearly 200 pounds
and can't be pulled down easily. "I don't blame Fred," he said, "I blame the
referee."

Said Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari: "We think it was a penalty."

The goal seemed to liberate a Brazilian side and the crowd of some 60,000 at
Arena Corinthians, including President  Dilma Rousseff, who leapt from her
seat when the ball hit the back of the net. A third goal from Oscar in
stoppage time sealed the win.

[(See how the World Cup would play out if countries were competing in things
other than soccer.)](http://graphics.wsj.com/documents/WORLDCUPTOEE/)

Still, the Brazilians rarely found the rhythm or cohesion that has always
marked its samba-style soccer. The team joined the raucous crowd in a
thrilling a cappella rendition of the national anthem's second verse, but
after that things quickly deteriorated for the five-time world champions.

Instead of technical wizardry and precision passing, there was tightness as
Brazil kept falling victim to Croatia's attacks down the sidelines. Then, in
the 11th minute, disaster struck.

Croatia's Ivica Olic darted down the left side and fired a cross into the
middle of the penalty area toward a sprinting  Nikica Jelavic, who deflected
the ball through defender David Luiz's legs. Chasing back to help defend,
Brazil's Marcelo took his eye off the ball just long enough to let it carom
off his left foot and into the goal. Goalkeeper Julio Cesar never had a
chance.

The goal sent a panic through the favorites, who were suddenly facing a
deficit in a game that was supposed to be a celebration. Instead of dazzling
the crowd, they turned physical, throwing elbows at Croatia, including a
particularly violent one from Neymar to Luka Modric's left cheek that earned
the young star a yellow card.

Meanwhile, Croatia kept pressing. In the 29th minute, Cesar nearly got beat on
a header from 6 yards that easily could have found the net.

Instead, Cesar turned the ball up field. Seconds later it was somehow on
Neymar's feet 20 yards from the goal. Dribbling to his left, Neymar stunned
Croatia with a searing shot across the grass, just passing Pletikosa's
fingertips as he dived to his left. The ball caromed off the post and into the
net.

Scolari said he was proud of what is a very young team for turning the score
around. "We needed to tie the game in order to breathe more in the second
half," he said.

With only Mexico and Cameroon left to play in the group stage, the Brazilians
got past their biggest obstacle of the first round. They are smart enough to
know that what awaits them after that in the knockout stage—likely Spain, the
Netherlands or Chile—is going to require a different effort from players not
named Oscar and Neymar. A little more samba soccer wouldn't hurt either.

[(See photos of World Cup mascots.)](http://online.wsj.com/articles/photos-
fuleco-the-armadillo-and-world-cup-mascots-of-the-past-1402009304#8)

"I believe individually we have a very strong squad and when we play
collectively we are very difficult to beat," Neymar said. "If our whole team
doesn't play connected we won't win."

I feel bad for Croatia. First the bad penalty call, then they got robbed of a
goal they scored because the referee called a foul when the forward went up
for a header at the same time the Brazilian goalie tried to catch the ball.
The header resulted in a goal scoring pass, but was called back. What a joke.

  

I would normally have been rooting for Brazil in that game as I am Portuguese,
but not for a win like that. It really is a shame. I was looking forward to
the Cup, but now question the validity of these games. We will see if this
poor officiating/ picking of winners continues.

The game was about the two who were "saved" by the result ... Marcello with
the own goal, and the Japanese referee giving a penalty that was unjustifiable
at this level. One can only imagine the scorn that would have been heaped on
these two, if the game had ended even in a draw!

  

But Neymar's perfect-to-the-inch first goal, and Oscar (the hero of the game
in my book) conjuring up an exquisite goal out of nothing assured a fair
victory for Brazil, in a game that lacked beauty.

Here is the video ... replay (the replay in it - which is not from the refs.
original angle) and judge (it can be paused and advance by frames)

  
<http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/videos/highlights/match=300186456/index.html>  
  
To me it is clear that while the Croat did use his arm to restrain the
Brazilian who feel back, the ball was out of his reach facing away from goal.
He could have NOT scored, even if the Croat had not touched him, though he
could have chased the ball if he wanted and played on. Sadly, acting is a part
of this game, and the referee was not in a position to clearly see whether the
Brazilian had actually been pulled down, or fell ... deliberately or
otherwise.

Here are my observations of the game:

1) Horrible penalty call by the referee (start packing your bags, you are
going back to Japan)

2) Horrible performance by the Croatian goalkeeper. He played as if he had 100
lbs of lead on his feet.

3) The best player on the field was Oscar

As long as FIFA refuses to put the best referees on the field in its showcase
games, soccer will never achieve its rightful position as the premier sport in
the world. Putting its opening World Cup game in the hands of a ref who cannot
tell the difference between a penalty and a dive is a travesty and brings the
entire sport into disrepute. The call was not controversial -- it was simply
an amateur blunder in front of a TV audience of several hundred million fans.
In any of the top European leagues, Fred would have received a Caution (yellow
card) for simulation and the game would have remained a fair one. P.S. I am a
big fan of Brazilian soccer, but I am no fan of incompetent referees.

That game was sickening on so many levels. While there were moments of
brilliance on both sides, if Croatia had fielded a half-way competent goalie,
and Brazil hadn't been aided in their go ahead goal by a yellow card -a card
that should have been given to Brazil for flopping- Croatia would have at
least tied, and more than likely won the game.

  

I hope this isn't a replay of 2010 South Africa, where the referee's
determined the outcome and tarnished the image of the game,exhibiting the
degree to which FIFA is as corrupt an international institution as the Vatican
and the United Nations. But, I have the feeling that no matter what, Brazil is
slated to advance beyond the group stage, despite being a shell of the once
vaunted Brazilian teams that defined the "Beautiful Game".

depth that they are almost invincible. If one thing doesn't work then another

[@Eric Biss](http://online.wsj.com/user/profile/public/105408958) [@Ray
Damani](http://online.wsj.com/user/profile/public/Travel)  I suppose if the
floppers were required to sub-out for their safety, using one of the few and
valuable substitution opportunities in  game,  they would think twice about
giving the Oscar wining performances. This is the single reason I am not that
into professional soccer. It has become like professional wrestling.

[@Eric Biss](http://online.wsj.com/user/profile/public/105408958) [@Ray
Damani](http://online.wsj.com/user/profile/public/Travel) Yeah quite strange.
I would like to see a little less acting and a little more honor. How about a
reverse penalty rule. If a player fakes afoul, if he continues to lie about it
to the ref and if playback is allowed in the game. The team that fakes the
foul is punished in the same matter if it was a legitimate foul after a ref
performs a review. That is, if a player fakes a foul for a penalty kick, and
if he does not admit it and if a ref reviews it under playback and sees the
acting, the other team is given the penalty kick. After a few such calls,
acting will go the way of the dodo!

@XAVIER L SIMON Unless the pairings of the second round prevent it, it is
going to be Spain's Cup again (v. Germany or Argentina/Uruguay), without
Brazil even being in the final.

Damani](http://online.wsj.com/user/profile/public/Travel) First, I don't think
any player will admit to flopping. Second, a replay might still not determine
whether a foul was committed or not and would certainly take a great deal of
time and seriously impair the flow of the game, which is an essential part of
soccer.

  

No, (with the exception of goal line decisions where replay can determine the
position of the ball) there is no substitute for a referee's immediate
decision and thus no substitute for having the best possible referees on the
field - and even then there will be mistakes.

Damani](http://online.wsj.com/user/profile/public/Travel) The only reason to
not allow instant replay is to allow the current state of corruption in FIFA.
There is a reason why football has the reputation of being on of the mos
corrupt sports there is on a global level. And the stubborn immediate decision
ruining game play is just an excuse to keep open the possibility to rig
results to develop outcome for either marketing sales or gambling purposes.
Instant replay would go a long way to return some honesty to this game.
Football has flow, soccer has plenty of gaps and walking around waiting for
something to be arranged.

Tax policy is back in the news in Japan, and this time it's a good story.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is likely to push through a cut in the corporate
income tax. Mr. Abe hasn't offered a specific number, except to suggest it
should fall to below 30% within five years. A rate between 20% and 25% would
put Japan on par with most European countries. Its current top rate approaches
America's 35% as the developed world's highest.

Two days into the World Cup, the mystery of Day One still burns in Brazil: Did
Fred really fall?

Brazil and Croatia were tied, 1-1, in the second half of Thursday's tournament
opener. Fred had the ball at his feet in the box when Croatia's Dejan Lovren
placed a hand on his shoulder. Fred fell backward. The ref blew his whistle.
Brazil's Neymar nailed a penalty kick, giving Brazil a 2-1 lead in a game it
went on to win 3-1.

Brazilians applauded the foul. But the rest of the world saw it as a flop.

The Count wondered: What if a physicist were making the call?

Stony Brook University physicist Chang Kee Jung analyzed the play frame by
frame and estimated it would take 600 Newtons of force for Lovren to stop
[Fred's](http://quotes.wsj.com/FRED)[ FRED -0.10 %
](http://quotes.wsj.com/FRED) forward motion. The force required to cause him
to fall backward, Jung said, would have been "much larger" than that.

So was Fred's fall legitimate? "Highly unlikely," says Jung.

Lynchburg College physicist Eric Goff also studied video of the 0.4 seconds in
question. After scrutinizing his "linear and angular momenta," Goff concluded
that Fred's fall only could have happened if Fred had made a conscious
decision to hit the dirt.

There's a highly scientific term for that: Fred took a dive.

The call was understandable.  The referee had visions of his head on a stake
in the middle of the field.  His survival instinct did the rest.

I guess it goes without saying, you don't need to be a (rocket) scientist to
get this one.

Investors were jolted out of their tranquility this week, driving stocks to
their first weekly decline in a month and sending oil prices to the biggest
gain this year.

The sudden escalation of tensions in the Middle East and unexpected political
upheaval helped drive down the Dow Jones Industrial Average by 0.9% for the
week, retreating from a record close that it notched Tuesday. The S&P 500 lost
0.7%.

Iraq is edging closer to all-out sectarian conflict. We report that the

We note that Iran is facing its biggest security challenge since the U.S.-led

When Ferrari Formula One ace Fernando Alonso waves the _tricolore _to start
the 24 Hours of Le Mans on Saturday, he will be signaling to more than the
drivers.

In an interview this week in his office in Maranello, Italy, Ferrari chairman
Luca di Montezemolo vented his discontents with the organizers of F1, the
elite open-wheel racing series that dominates world motor sport, and suggested
the company may enter sports-car competition instead.

"Formula One isn't working," he said. "It's declining because [the Federation
International d'Automobile, the sport's governing body] have forgotten that
people watch the racing for the excitement. Nobody watches racing for the
efficiency, come on."

FIA didn't respond to a request for comment. Montezemolo stressed no decision
has been made. A statement posted late Friday on Ferrari's racing team's
website said "some elements of the media" had mischaracterized Montezemolo's
words. The statement said it was "a bit of a stretch" to say that Ferrari
would quit F1, while also saying "there is a unique attraction to the 24 Hour
race." The statement also said "there's nothing to stop Ferrari" from
competing in both disciplines.

The Scuderia Ferrari team's battles with FIA are well known and of long
standing. The current dispute arises out of a new set of F1 rules for 2014
that are intended to make the sport greener as well as make it more affordable
to the participants, with restrictions on the number of engines, tires and
other technical resources.

In particular, Montezemolo complained about rules that forbid engine
development during the season, a rule that has left Ferrari a distant third in
the standings. "And we cannot touch the engine?" he said, visibly frustrated.

Montezemolo also complained about the restricted—some have said
strangled—sound of the new engines. "People watch racing to be entertained,"
he said. "No one wants to watch a driver save gas or tires. They want to see
them push from here to there. It's sport, yes, but also a show."

Montezemolo suggested that his company could instead pursue endurance racing
of the type practiced at Le Mans, perhaps as soon as 2020. Ferrari competed at
the top levels of sports-car racing from 1947 to 1973, winning Le Mans nine
times, but left the sport at the end of 1972, with founder Enzo Ferrari
deciding to concentrate resources on F1. Ferrari has been a continuous
presence on the Grand Prix grid for more than a half-century.

"Of course," Montezemolo said, "we cannot do sports-car racing and Formula
One. It's not possible."

**"The Fox and the Grapes"** is one of the traditional [Aesop's fables](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesop%27s_fables) and can be held to illustrate the concept of [cognitive dissonance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance).

FIA, FIFA, and the IOC are all business models of the same ilk. Perhaps the

ones getting fleeced.

To better understand Ferrari's discontent it would be nice to have a bit more
transparency on the financial books, engineering restraint, and other general
biznez blah to make a better comment on the few players in F1 frustration
beyond not being a perennial winner.  Honda and Toyota left with the 2008
global financial crisis, Mercedes threatened to leave if their effort didn't
find some success.  There are other venues, and money is an ongoing challenge
to find when other doors are open, and transportation development is moving in
different directions that make decisions to allocate resources a "hard
choice".

As a fan of F1 and with Ferrari being one of my favourite cars and team, I
think as many have stated, that Ferrari are a bit upset they are not winning
no matter how much changes they have made and effort put in, which has
frustrated them. As a fan, I also believe that F1 should be leading and
driving green initiatives and changes in modern car technology because it is
the right and responsible thing to do.

Yeah, right... I remember when Ferrari fell out with the FIA before and
actually built & ran / tested an Indycar before they got their way and the
project was scrapped... Ferrari leave F1? More chance of Ecclestone giving his
share of Formula One to charity.....

He's right about the formula declining, and the blame imho can be laid
squarely at the front wing, the aero package and the weapons-grade
aerodynamicists who sculpt the cars. Minimise the aero-dependency and you may
just get good racing again...

Im a big F1 fan, and I come from a family background that has always liked
muscle cars, loud engines, more power.

  

I see that maybe Ferrari is a little upset with not winning any championships,
and perhaps they need to learn how to adapt a little better.

  

However, I am not sure if I care for the "go greener" initiative.  I do agree
with Luca on this point.  Fans like the noise, the adrenaline, the excitement
of raw power.  Every year F1 creates new regulations and laws to restrict what
was once free.  The fans do not care about the tires or petrol saved.  I mean
what is it going to come too, all electric F1 cars that silently fly by the
crowd?

Personally, I think the complaint of the Ferrari chairman Luca di Montezemolo
is because during the last seasons Ferrari didn’t win championships.

From the other side, today the big fight is between the teams of Mercedes Benz
and Red Bull Racing Renault with powerful machines and very aggressive pilots.

Watch the 1966 movie Gran Prix and compare racing to today, Fernando is right.
Much progress has been made in safety (Thank you Jackie) but the cars are now
the result of committee.  This is a celebration of bureaucracy, not real
racing.

Maybe the only excuse for a hybrid F1 serries is that the technology could
eventually be useful for street performance cars.  LaFerreri is already with
us but more development could be useful to lower the cost in other
applications.

Seems that the only valid excuse for a hybrid F1 car would be that the
technology will eventually translate to street performance cars.  Not
necessarily a bad idea. On the other hand Audi has been running diesels at Le
Mans for awhile and we don't have many sporty diesels in the US.

Ferrari's problems are systemic to trying to run a world-class operation in
Italy. _Mutually exclusive, world-class and Italy._

  

Ferrari lacks the management and engineering talent needed to excel...remember
Todt, Brawn? Recently Ferrari approached design genius Adrian Newey (of Red
Bull Racing) but was rebuffed because Adrian didn't want to have to deal with
Ferrari's Italian management politics and have to relocate his family to Italy
-- a nice place to visit, but not to run a world-class F1 team. Try the U.K.,
Luca.

  

Those that have visited both Maranello (Ferrari) and Milton Keynes (RBR), say
that there's a distinct 'mom and pop' feel to everything at Ferrari, compared
to the clinical business efficiency at RBR. I suspect there's nothing homey
about Mercedes, the current runaway F1 points leaders and although a German
team, much of the team personnel is British around London...come and visit,
Luca! Ciao!

Unfortunately, WSC has its own problems, as does NASCAR, IndyCar and the NFL,
for Pete's sake. Better the devil you know....

  

Ferrari is inextricably intertwined with F1. Its corporate image requires
involvement with F!. They can get plenty of exposure in Sports Car racing just
by supporting privateers, without the huge financial and management costs.

I have one nit to pick with the article.  Ferrari left the World Sports Car
Championship after the 1973 season.

  

They dominated 1972 with the Ferrari 312PB, winning all but LeMans which the
French Matra won in its sole race that year.

  

For 1973, Ferrari put together a 'rock star' line up of drivers; but had
altered the 312PB by lengthening in the the wheel base.  Matra came in for the
whole season and was dominant.

  

The decision was made that for '74 to focus all of the resources on F1 with
new drivers Clay Regazzoni and Niki Lauda.   The F1 car the 312B3 was sorted
out after a dismal 73 season and with the 312T in 75 were dominant.

I agree that everything with F-1 is presently screwed up. Frankly, I can't
remember any time in the last 40 odd years when it wasn't screwed up. And if
El Supremo dictates that next year the cars will be powered by free-range
squirrels, I'll STILL follow the sport like an idiot. I mean, it's Formula 1,
for crying out loud.

I have been attending F1 Grands Prix since 1977 and I completely agree with
Mr. Montezemolo.  The current state of Formula One racing is a joke with a
focus on green "eco" conscious platitudes and the insertion of safety cars
after every little spin out.  Give me a break.

  

I miss the glorious sound of a Ferrari V-12 revving at 19,000 RPM without
regard to fuel consumption.  The current crop of F1 race cars sound like an
eight cylinder garbage truck running on five cylinders.

  

In the current worldwide egalitarian onslaught, Grand Prix racing needs to
rediscover its elitism and put on a screaming, technologically sophisticated,
high decibel SHOW.  Until it does, I can be bored by golf at much lower cost.

No it's not. It's cool, and different, but it's not even close to "way
cooler." Now, put a few more restrictions on the F1 engine so it sounds like
an electric razor instead of the lawnmower it sounds like this year, and I'll
probably end up agreeing with you...

@Richard Butler  Think of how race fans must have reacted when they quit
running the 24 liter, 12 cylinder, two ton Napier-Railton back in 1938.  The
roar of that engine is legendary.  But looking back, aren't we all glad that
progress was allowed to advance.  Think of the huge, smoke emitting vehicle
that Professor Fate (Jack Lemon) drove in the mid 1960's movie The Great Race.

  

I prefer progress that makes vehicles lighter, more energy efficient, cleaner
and capable of being just as fast or faster. Compare the performance of almost
any muscle car of the mid to late 60's with most modern four door sedans of
today.  Todays vehicles are better in almost every way, and usually just as
quick.

  

There will be recordings of the shriek of the F1 V-10's of the recent past,
but to me, the sound of this year's F1 engines represents the sound of
progress.

sound of last year's screaming V-8s with the blown diffusers...the dust inside
my head was rattling...my ears were hurting...I loved it! Not sure I'll be
attending this year...

@Richard Butler

  

People are drawn to F-1 for the spectacle and the audio.(understandable)

That being said...I'm still cheering for the success upcoming F-E series.

_ _Salvador, Brazil_ _

Spain will technically be the world champion for another month, until someone
lifts the trophy in Rio de Janeiro. But barring a remarkable recovery at this
tournament, Friday will go down as the day the Spanish dynasty died.

Spain didn't just drop its [World Cup opener](http://www.wsj.com/worldcup), as
it did four years ago to Switzerland. It watched the Netherlands set it on
fire. With a four-goal second half, the Dutch demolished one of the greatest
sides to ever play the game, 5-1.

"Absolutely inexplicable," Spain coach Vicente del Bosque said. "I have no
words."

[ ![](http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OG-

AB638_WCUP14_D_20140612154830.jpg) ENLARGE  ](http://graphics.wsj.com/wc-game-
recaps/#/?g=731769)

A minute-by-minute statistical breakdown of how the match of the day played
out: [Inside the Box.](http://graphics.wsj.com/wc-game-recaps/)

Friday's result can't change the fact that the Netherlands lost the 2010 World
Cup final to Spain. But there can be nothing better for the Dutch soccer
neuroses than this trouncing.[ (See how the World Cup would play out if
countries were competing in things other than
soccer.)](http://graphics.wsj.com/documents/WORLDCUPTOEE/)

The Netherlands' therapy began the moment striker  [Robin van
Persie](http://topics.wsj.com/person/P/Robin-van-Persie/6122) launched himself
into a swan dive. Suspended in midair, he met a 35-yard pass to loop the ball
home and tie the game at 1, just before halftime.

He seemed to lift the weight of four years off Dutch shoulders. When they came
out for the second half, his unfancied side played at a speed that made Spain
look like it was standing still. Van Persie added another goal, Arjen Robben
had two and even defender Stefan de Vrij got it on the act.

![Netherlands' Robin van Persie scores his team's first

DG081_0613es_P_20140613155551.jpg) ENLARGE

"In the end, it could have been five—well, it was five—but it could have been
six, seven or eight," van Persie said.

Back in the Netherlands—where hopes were dim coming into the tournament—fans
were deliriously jumping back on the bandwagon. [(See a guide to Brazil's
World Cup stadiums.)](http://online.wsj.com/articles/in-brazil-the-futebol-
can-finally-begin-1402532925?tesla=y)

"I'm ecstatic," said David Vermijs, 34, a consultant from Amsterdam. "I had
good hopes about a successful outcome, but could never have dreamt of a
complete walkover like tonight."

Much of the blame will fall on Spain's 33-year-old goalkeeper Iker Casillas.
Once a golden boy of Spanish soccer, he no longer starts for his club side,
Real Madrid, in league games—a falling out with former manager Jose Mourinho
landed him on the bench.

On Friday, Mourinho was vindicated. Casillas was caught out of position on at
least two goals and offered up the fourth by miscontrolling a back pass.

Those individual errors were a distraction from Spain's larger problem: a
brewing crisis of tiki-taka, the quick-passing style that lifted it to the top
of the sport.

"It would be a mistake to change it," Spain and Barcelona midfielder Xavi said
of the approach before the game. "All our players have adapted to this
philosophy and we're going to stay with it right to the very end."

Spain stuck to its guns, but the Dutch revamped. Under coach Louis van Gaal,
the team is a far cry from the self-loathing squad that lost every game at
Euro 2012. It's an efficient team set up in a 5-3-2 system that was only
introduced the past few weeks.

Robben gave the Netherlands the lead for good in the 53rd minute. The third
goal, when it came, wasn't as pretty. But by bundling home a free kick from a
yard out, de Vrij made up for the earlier foul on Costa, which led to Spain's
opening goal. (Xabi Alonso converted the penalty kick.)

But once Robben and van Persie started running wild, Spain's lead became just
a distant memory. And so did South Africa.

The 4-4-2 would be the most interesting and surprising,with both Van Persie
and Huntelaar up front and one controlling midfielder and three attacking
ones.I do think van Gaal will go to his signature 4-3-3 against Chile and
Australia though..but we will see.I am really glad the ghosts of WC 2010 have
been exorcised.

The only downside to yesterdays game is that the Netherlands will now have to
change system again. Back to a 4-3-3 or maybe even a 4-4-2 . Because no team
is going to play football and attack the Netherlands like Spain did.From now
on they are all going to hang back,no one wants to get cut to pieces like
Spain.

And Wow, Wow, Wow! I'm still trying to catch my breath. What a game.

  

For the better or the worse, I fear this game might end up being the "peak"
experience of this World Cup, though it can't be called an epic because of the
score line!

  

After S. Africa in 2010, this was sweet revenge for the Dutch.

  

Go Bosnia Herzegovina!

RVP's first goal and Robben's second might be the goals of the tourney.

WHEN I WENT OFF to university, my parents stuffed some old sheets in my
suitcase. Last year, my husband and I spent the best part of a day and many
hundreds of pounds choosing soft furnishings and accessories with our 20-year-
old son for his dorm room. He not only knew his style—Scandinavian retro—but
he knew which stores were best for what look. This even extended to choice of
mugs by Emma Bridgewater.

Picture-led social media, such as Instagram and Pinterest, and the trend in
fashion for brand extension mean that...

The _banh mi_ sandwich is itself the product of many miles traveled: the
crusty bread brought to Vietnam by French colonists, filled with all the
bright, hot, fresh, meaty, intensely tasty elements of the local cuisine. This
delicious cultural collision is the subject of "The Banh Mi Handbook: Recipes
for Crazy-Delicious Vietnamese Sandwiches" by  Andrea Nguyen. Out July 8 from
Ten Speed Press, it's a master course in banh mi construction, from the bread
to the pickles and condiments to every imaginable filling, whether it's pork
meatballs or fried oysters or a lipsmacking citrus-marinated grilled chicken
you're hankering for. Wrap up a few for the road and declare independence from
insipid rest-stop subs.

**Hanoi Grilled Chicken Banh Mi**

**Total Time:** 1¼ hours **Serves:** 6

Trim and discard fat from **1½ pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs**. If
thighs are large and/or very uneven in thickness, butterfly them.

In a bowl, stir together **¼ teaspoon sugar**, **rounded ¼ teaspoon salt**,
**1¼ teaspoons freshly ground black pepper**, **1 tablespoon fish sauce** and
**1 tablespoon fresh lime juice** and **1½ tablespoons canola oil**. Add
chicken, turning pieces to coat well. Cover with plastic wrap and marinate at
room temperature 30 minutes.

Grill chicken: Heat a grill to medium, or set a grill pan on the stove top
over medium-high heat. Brush a little canola oil over grate or pan. Lay
chicken on grate or pan and cook, turning several times, until nicely browned
all over and juices flow clear when you pierce the flesh with the tip of a
knife, 6-10 minutes. Let cool 10 minutes, then slice chicken across the grain
into slices about ¼-inch-thick. (Chicken will keep up to 3 days in the
refrigerator.) /

Make sandwiches: Use a serrated knife to halve **6 mini-baguettes or 6-inch
baguette sections**, leaving bread attached on one side to hold sandwich
together. Use your fingers to scoop out some of the insides from one or both
halves of the bread, depending on how bready you want your sandwiches to be.
Spread **mayonnaise** on both cut sides of bread. Drizzle **soy sauce** over
mayonnaise and season with **salt** and **pepper**. Layer on each sandwich:
about **¼ pound sliced chicken**, **¼ cup drained pickled vegetables**, **3-4
thin slices Fresno or other medium-hot chili**, **4-6 thinly sliced cucumber
rounds** and **1-2 tablespoons coarsely chopped cilantro sprigs**. Close
sandwiches and cut in half crosswise.

FIFA banned German legend  Franz Beckenbauer from all soccer activities for 90
days on Friday for failing to cooperate with an investigation into the 2022
World Cup bid process.

The sanction by soccer's world governing body came at the request of former
U.S. federal prosecutor  Michael Garcia, who was collecting evidence on the
controversial decisions to award the 2018 and 2022 tournaments to Russia and
Qatar, respectively.

Beckenbauer, a World Cup winner as a player and a manager, hasn't disputed the
charge. He said publicly in a news conference in Munich last week that he had
rejected Garcia's requests on two occasions. He criticized both Garcia's tone
and the process, pointing out that he is no longer directly involved in the
sport.

"Firstly, I must say that I am seriously surprised about Mr. Garcia's
approach," Beckenbauer said then. "I am no longer actively involved in
football, and he has therefore no power whatsoever to interview me. Fact is
also, that Mr. Garcia, who is probably used to calling the shots, reacted
unpleasantly to my response and tried the limits of my patience in his second
missive, both in tone and content. I believe that the gentleman should try to
understand that we like to maintain a certain form in Europe."

But in 2010, when Qatar won the vote to host the World Cup, Beckenbauer was
one of the FIFA executive committee's 22 voting members. He retired from the
executive committee in 2011.

"The apparent breach relates to Mr. Beckenbauer's failure to cooperate with an
Ethics Committee investigation despite repeated requests for his assistance,
including requests that he provide information during an in-person interview
or in response to written questions provided in both English and German," FIFA
said in a statement.

Garcia, appointed by FIFA's ethics committee, traveled the world meeting
current and former FIFA officials, as well as the various 2018 and 2022 bid
committees, for a year. He finished gathering evidence this week and is
expected to deliver his final report in about six weeks, once the 2014 World
Cup is over. He didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

SAN PEDRO SULA, Honduras—Luis Javier Tejada is an example of why, in many
ways, there has never been a better time to be gay in Honduras.

Last year, the graphic artist rejoiced as two openly gay candidates ran for
the Honduran National Congress, which had just passed a broad measure against
hate speech based on "sexual orientation or gender identity." This spring he
was looking forward to drawing a salary from a Dutch group supporting his work
with HIV-positive Hondurans.

But cultural change comes slowly. Neither gay candidate came close to
winning—and one fled Honduras after reporting that a mob ransacked her offices
and savagely beat her. Mr. Tejada's partner also fled. Both sought asylum in
New York, where Mr. Tejada, 33 years old, hopes he will soon do the same.

For that, he will rely on something most aspiring immigrants here can't:
membership in a class the U.S. State Department recognizes as under attack.
"Social discrimination against LGBT persons was widespread" in Honduras, reads
the department's 2013 international human-rights report, using an acronym for
lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. The report notes that "NGOs
reported 24 violent deaths of LGBT individuals" through last September.

to leave San Pedro Sula to seek asylum in the U.S. He said gangs threatened
him. Alicia Vera for The Wall Street Journal

Such official assessments have fueled a surge of successful asylum petitions
from gays and lesbians in the Americas. Arguing that they suffer persecution
because of their sexual orientation, hundreds if not thousands have managed to
find safe haven, and a potential path to U.S. citizenship, in recent years.
Fellow Latin Americans lodging asylum claims based on generalized violence,
meanwhile, are routinely denied.

Many Hondurans wind up on the South Bronx couch of Fredy Triminio, a Honduran
gay-rights activist who says he has guided nearly 50 countrymen into the
process since 2009, when the 41-year-old gained asylum himself. "Honduras is
known now as a place where it is dangerous to be gay," he says.

How it got that way says a lot about sweeping changes in U.S. asylum policy,
and the power of a dedicated lobby. During the Cold-War years, most asylum-
seekers claimed they were persecuted by their governments for political
reasons. Today, applicants are more likely to say they are threatened by
religious persecution or myriad social ills, from female genital mutilation to
spousal abuse.

![](http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OG-
AB663_GFX1_E_ER_20140613150910.jpg)

Among the biggest new beneficiaries, based on a reading of federal data and
interviews with immigration experts, are sexual minorities. Last year, just
one New York-based advocacy group, Immigration Equality, helped put 279 LGBT
foreigners into the asylum process, a 250% increase from 2009. Altogether, the
group has helped 1,130 people seek asylum in the past decade, with 421 cases
still pending. Their success rate for closed cases: 98%, roughly quadruple the
batting average of the typical asylum-seeker.

The jump in gay asylum cases tracks a growing willingness by Americans to
embrace alternative lifestyles as well as a determination by U.S. foreign-
policy officials to protect sexual orientation as a basic human right. In
recent months, American leaders have denounced a new law in Russia
criminalizing "recruitment" by gays, as well as practices in places such as
Uganda and Nigeria that punish homosexuals with severe sentences, even death.

A close analysis of asylum trends, though, suggests that most gay asylum
seekers don't come from these high-profile countries, but rather from the
Americas. Data compiled by Homeland Security's U.S. Citizenship and
Immigration Services unit don't break out asylum claims for gays and lesbians,
who typically apply under a catchall category called "member of a particular
social group." According to data released to The Wall Street Journal under the
Freedom of Information Act, the largest source countries over the past decade
were Mexico, Guatemala, Colombia and Haiti, with Russia coming in fifth place.
Nine of the top 25 were from the Americas.

![](http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OG-
AB664_GFX2_E_ER_20140613150916.jpg)

The rise in gay asylum cases comes at a time of soaring bloodshed in Latin
America. Newly released United Nations data show that Latin America is the
world's most violent region, accounting for nearly one in three global
homicides. The worst homicide rate by far belongs to Honduras, where 7,172
people were murdered in 2012, or 90.4 out of 100,000. The U.S. rate, by
contrast, is 4.7.

Some human-rights advocates in the region believe the U.S. should modify its
asylum policies to make a place for average citizens caught in the crossfire.
Juan Wilfredo Castellanos, northern Honduras' official human rights
commissioner, says a lot of his country's violence should be classified as
persecution under international asylum norms because much of it stems from the
government's inability to protect its citizens.

"The authorities here don't have the resources to investigate crime, let alone
stop it," the lawyer says wearily, adding that as the murder rate climbs, so
has the tide of would-be refugees who want their "denunciations" of death
threats they have received archived by his staff, to present as evidence in a
future asylum application once they leave Honduras.

But merely stating you have been threatened doesn't work for everyone. Juan
Manuel Jimenez, a 31-year-old father from the coastal city of La Ceiba, spent
about $2,000 last summer to sneak into the U.S. In Texas, U.S. Border Patrol
agents arrested his crossing party. He immediately tried to open an asylum
case, saying he was persecuted by "narco-traffickers, who threatened me with
death." He failed.

"The judge said I didn't qualify for asylum," said Mr. Jimenez. He spent four
months in detention before agreeing to drop his appeal and board one of
Homeland Security's daily repatriation flights to San Pedro Sula—one of 37,049
Hondurans deported in 2013.

The outcome was quite different for Carlos Flores, who fled San Pedro Sula for
New York last year. The 27-year-old bookkeeper kept a low profile in this
dangerous city, but was involved with LGBT civil-rights activists through his
partner, Mr. Tejada, the HIV activist here.

Mr. Flores says three police officers detained him in January 2013, along with
a transgender activist named Beyoncé who works with street walkers. The two
were tortured to provide information on a transgender activist wanted by
police, Mr. Flores says. He adds that the officers promised to return for more
punishment if they didn't find their suspect.

"They said they'd kill me," said Mr. Flores, who fled Honduras a few days
later. After leaving San Pedro Sula, Mr. Flores ended up in the South Bronx,
sofa surfing among an enclave of gay Hondurans in the apartment of Fredy
Triminio.

"It was easier for everyone after my case," said Mr. Triminio, who explains
that his archive of hate crimes committed against LGBT Hondurans often finds
its way into the evidence packets asylum seekers prepare. The claims are
almost always successful, he says.

Like many gay refugees, Mr. Flores turned to Immigration Equality. He made his
asylum application early last December represented by a pro bono attorney,
David Castleman, a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania Law School now
working for the firm Sullivan & Cromwell LLP.

Mr. Flores' asylum quest took less than four months. He received his grant of
asylum, which gives him permanent residence status, or a green card, on March
6.

Such fast turnarounds were a long time in coming. Once barred as "deviants"
from emigrating to the U.S. under any circumstances, gays saw their stigma
partially lifted for asylum purposes in 1990. They gained recognition as
members of a particular social group after the Board of Immigration Appeals
ruled in favor of a Cuban refugee who had been jailed and tortured for his
sexual orientation.

Michael Petrelis, an organizer for the group Gays Without Borders, says he
began lobbying the U.S. State Department to monitor what he and others called
"atrocities" against gays world-wide starting in 1991, as an Act Up militant
in Washington. "We tried all approaches," says the 55-year-old activist, who
lives now in San Francisco. "Winning asylum for those who got here. Fighting
to document attacks. Using the State Department's annual human rights reports
so our folks could gain asylum."

Accounts of specific hate crimes against homosexuals, or of crimes targeted at
LGBT leaders, began to appear in the late 1990s in the annual reports for a
handful of countries. By the middle of the next decade documentation was
becoming systematic, with the condition of sexual minorities addressed in most
places around the world.

The reports have turned out to be a key element in successful asylum cases.
"Often the only objective evidence is the U.S. State Department's report,"
says William Zimmer, who presided as an immigration court judge in Houston
until 2012.

Since many asylum precedents are set by federal courts, no one presidential
administration can move the needle significantly. But activists credit the
Obama White House with nudging the issue higher on the agenda.

LGBT migrants have become so commonplace among those apprehended along the
border that Homeland Security has opened two detention centers for them since
2011—one in Pearsall, Texas, the other in Santa Ana, California. That same
year the administration also issued a memorandum stating that community
ties—including for the first time, same-sex relationships—could help a
detained migrant win release pending a court appearance.

The administration has also issued a series of orders and memos spelling out
how LGBT asylum cases should be handled.

A 65-page publication, "Guidance For Adjudicating Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual,
Transgender, and Intersex (LGBTI) Refugee and Asylum Claims" prepared for
USCIS asylum officers in December 2011, notes that "the fact that LGBTI
organizations are permitted to hold a parade once a year…does not mean LGBTI
people are free from ongoing violence and harm in that country." The training
material, which the Immigration Equality activist group says it helped
prepare, explains that the guidelines for gay asylum applicants are the same
as for any other asylum-seeker.

In fact, though, the instructions appear to carve out some exceptions. For
instance, asylum policy states that individuals generally have no more than a
year to lodge a petition once they arrive in the U.S. The guide notes that
LGBTI individuals who come to the U.S. for work or school, and weren't fleeing
violence, might "come out" after arriving. Their asylum claim would be based
on a fear of persecution if they returned home.

Immigration officials and advocates said they weren't aware of any cases
involving an applicant faking being gay to gain asylum. As with any asylum-
related fraud, the potential penalties are severe, including being banned from
the U.S. for life. "Asylum officers are trained extensively in interviewing
techniques, evaluating evidence, researching country of origin information,
and analyzing credibility based on objective criteria," a USCIS spokesman
says.

The country reporting by the State Department became a higher priority under
the Obama administration. "As posts affirmatively raise concerns about the
rights of women, religious minorities, and other vulnerable persons, posts
also should raise any concerns about the human rights of LGBT persons in
meetings with host government officials and other civic and business leaders,"
Secretary Hillary Clinton wrote in 2010 in an instruction telegram cable to
all diplomatic and consular posts.

The secretary emphasized: "posts are requested to proactively identify and
engage LGBT civil society groups, and to assess and respond to threats to the
human rights of LGBT persons."

* * *

That is occurring in a big way in Honduras, even though the official legal
climate here, as in much of Latin America, is relatively favorable to sexual
minorities.

Last year, Honduras' National Congress amended the penal code to sanction
anyone "who publicly or through the media incites discrimination, hate,
repression, or violence against a person or group for reasons of their sex,
gender, age, sexual orientation," a development U.S. diplomats praised.

Charles Blaha, a State Department official monitoring human rights progress in
Latin America, suggests that good laws alone don't mean some people in the
LGBT community don't deserve asylum consideration. "The fact is, in many of
these countries, even though the government is doing good things and trying
hard, these are entrenched societal attitudes and they play themselves out
sometimes in very ugly, violent ways," he says.

A common route from San Pedro Sula, Honduras, to the U.S. border, in part on
the dangerous freight train known as 'La Bestia.'

The unit, based in San Pedro Sula, hasn't stopped much crime, says federal
prosecutor Norma Zobeida Narvaez, who runs the unit. But the effort has
benefited asylum seekers, essentially by documenting crime against sexual
minorities—and demonstrating how infrequently such crime meets punishment.

Over the past three years, State Department reporting indicates nearly 100
LGBT individuals have been murdered in Honduras.

However, human-rights workers and diplomats acknowledge that, given the
general level of violence in San Pedro Sula, it is often hard to know if the
murders had anything to do with the victim's sexual orientation. The area has
become a key transit point for narcotics leaving South American and headed
north, and there is a high degree of police corruption. On most days, and
especially nights, the city can resemble a shooting gallery.

Ms. Narvaez pulled the file of one person murdered in 2012—a transgender
street walker shot to death by a customer who ran home to get his gun after he
suspected his pocket had been picked during the encounter.

"But the one he shot was not the one who serviced him. He made a mistake,"
said the prosecutor. "So can we really classify this as a hate crime?"

Carlos Fernando Vallejo, a transgender prostitute-turned-activist from San
Pedro Sula known as Fernanda, cited a similarly ambiguous event in a complaint
to the local human-rights commission. In January 2013, Ms. Vallejo said a
prostitute with the street name Nahomi came at her with a knife. "I defended
myself and Nahomi fell to the street," Ms. Vallejo testified in a statement.
"Later Nahomi sent some gang guys to threaten me." She later claimed she was
insulted and beaten by gang members who told her they wanted to "get rid of
maricones," a vulgar word for homosexuals. Ms. Vallejo entered the U.S.
illegally through Mexico and is now seeking asylum.

René Perdomo, a Honduran gay activist who arrived in New York for a United
Nations conference in April 2011 and decided to bid for asylum after
overstaying his tourist visa, received the benefit of the doubt.

"It was a really easy process," recalls the 29-year-old, whose evidence packet
included affidavits from three Hondurans vouching for his character and citing
his work with a transgender collective.

Mr. Perdomo also presented a résumé, and a stack of newspaper clippings
chronicling attacks on gays in his homeland. He said his own life was
endangered, and that gangs and police had threatened him, but wasn't required
to show any proof.

"I got my asylum on 16 April [2013]. The whole thing took eight months," he
says. He lives today in Roseburg, Ore., where he works at a Mexican
restaurant. He says he plans to apply for U.S. citizenship as soon as he is
eligible, in about four years.
