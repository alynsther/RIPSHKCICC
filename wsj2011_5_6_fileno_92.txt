 'By the Way, Meet Vera Stark.' Opens Monday, Second Stage Theatre, New York 

Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Lynn Nottage's comedy about an African-American maid and aspiring actress named Vera Stark includes a film inside the play, a faux 1933 Southern epic created for the stage production. The film offers something rare for African-American actors in 1930s Hollywood: As Vera puts it, "Slaves with lines, honey." Vera, played by Sanaa Lathan ("Something New"), lands a part alongside her boss, a Hollywood starlet. It's a role she will later call "my shame and my glory."

'The Informant,' Thomas Perry 

For nearly 30 years and 19 novels, Thomas Perry has written about pursuers and the pursued. He's never been a best seller, but he is widely admired by his peers and by thriller aficionados for his economy of prose, smart research, craftsmanshipâ€”and skill with female protagonists, particularly his recurring character Jane Whitefield (not in this one), whose specialty was making people disappear. In "The Informant," he returns to the professional assassin he wrote about in his Edgar-winning first novel "The Butcher's Boy" and its sequel "Sleeping Dogs." He has been retired for 20 years but gets pulled into a tangled web involving the Mafia and the Justice Department. 

 'Man in Motion,' Warren Haynes  Tuesday 

Warren Haynes is best known as a team player: fronting for Gov't Mule; playing guitar along with Derek Trucks in the current incarnation of the Allman Brothers, noodling with the Dead, descendant of the Grateful Dead. "Man in Motion," though, is very much his own show, a Southern soul record with Memphis horns, scorching organ and stinging wah-wah, the star-studded band including Ivan Neville on keyboards and Ruthie Foster on background vocals. Mr. Haynes wrote or co-wrote all the songs except one, and does a lot of singing.
