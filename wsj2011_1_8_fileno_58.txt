 Discovery Times Square Exposition in New York, through Jan. 17 

An extension of "Tutankhamun and the Golden Age of the Pharaohs" means nine more days to see the chariot of Egypt's famous boy monarch, the crown he's thought to have worn during his reign and the most recent DNA findings on his death. Then, Tut, it's over: The multicity U.S. tour of this 150-object show that began in 2005 will end. 

 Israel Museum, Jerusalem; through March 5 

The Nazis' rise forced Jakob Steinhardt to leave his home in Germany, but they couldn't stop his art: Best known for woodcuts on biblical themes, the Berlin Expressionist found a new home and career in Jerusalem in the 1930s. "Jakob's Dream: Steinhardt in Prints, Drawings, and Paintings" features 120 works from his time in Germany and Israel.

 Tate Modern, London; through Jan. 16 

Paul Gauguin may be best remembered for the colorful paintings of women he created during his self-exile in Tahiti, but the more than 100 works in "Gauguin: Maker of Myth" touch upon the French Post-Impressionist's entire career, including "Vision of the Sermon," painted in the French province of Brittany. Air fare too pricey? The show moves to the National Gallery in Washington on Feb. 27.
