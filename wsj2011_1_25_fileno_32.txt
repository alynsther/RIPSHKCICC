WASHINGTONâ€”House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) Thursday called for spending cuts in exchange for an agreement to raise the U.S. debt limit, in an opening move in budget negotiations with the Obama administration. 

The nation could reach the $14.3 trillion debt limit by March 31, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner warned Thursday. In a letter to lawmakers, Mr. Geithner said that failure to act could "precipitate a default by the United States." 

"Do I want to see this nation default? No," Mr. Ryan said at an event at the National Press Club. "But I want to make sure we get substantial spending cuts and controls in exchange for raising the debt ceiling." 

Republicans may face challenges in keeping their caucus together in negotiations with the White House. Many of the tea-party backed Republicans have said they will vote against increasing the nation's borrowing capacity, even though failure to do so could lead to a shut-down of the federal government and possibly cause the U.S. to default on its sovereign debt obligations.
