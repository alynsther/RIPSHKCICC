What, exactly, took the New York fitness trainer David Kirsch 10 years to develop his own line of protein meal-replacement bars? "I'm very methodical," Mr. Kirsch said. "I was a lawyer and I'm a Capricorn. It took years and years, but I didn't care what it cost. Finally, we got it dead on."

Kirschbars, which were developed with a company in California, come in three flavors: cookies and cream, almond crunch and natural coffee mocha. They are available at his gym, the Madison Square Club, and at his website for $5 a pop or $45 for a box of 10. "They're quality bars," Mr. Kirsch said, by way of the price. "It's more than a Zone or a Cliff bar, but there's no comparison."

The bars are a 100% natural, sweetened naturally and gluten free. They use real dark chocolate and clock in at 240 calories. Mr. Kirsch tested more than 100 bars on the market as well as various pilot bars, using many of his female clients as well as his three sisters and mother (who "have a lot of opinions," he said) to get at the right formula. 

He now counts among fans of the Kirschbars the restaurateur Danny Meyer, and suggests, of course, eating them every day, the best time being between lunch and dinner. 

For men, "the caloric content isn't as much of an issue," he added, "because they're not looking to get into a bikini."
