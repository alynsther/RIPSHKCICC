The Jets haven't decided if or when quarterback Mark Sanchez will have shoulder surgery this offseason, general manager Mike Tannenbaum said Friday. Mr. Tannenbaum added that team doctor Ken Montgomery was collaborating with other "shoulder experts" to determine the best course of treatment. "We don't have a drop-dead date," Mr. Tannenbaum said.

Mr. Sanchez suffered a tear in the cartilage of his right shoulder during a game in Pittsburgh on Dec. 19. Earlier this week, he had said that because the shoulder had gradually felt better over the successive weeks, he was optimistic that surgery might be unnecessary.

American Bernard Lagat missed extending his record for wins in the Wanamaker Mile at the Millrose Games on Friday night by less than a second. 

Mr. Lagat finished second in the mile, posting a time of 3:59.01—beaten by Ethiopian Deresse Mekonnen, who ran the mile in 3:58.58. If Mr. Lagat had won, it would have been his ninth title in the event and his seventh in a row. Mr. Mekonnen is the two-time defending world indoor 1,500-meter champion.

Earlier in the night, Veronica Campbell-Brown of Jamaica, running in the 60-meter dash, recovered from a slow start out of the blocks and blew past a strong field to beat American Lauryn Williams and defending women's 60-meter champion Lisa Barber.
