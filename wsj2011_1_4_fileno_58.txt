A tip-in by Justin Brownlee with 10 seconds left put the Red Storm on top for good in a back-and-forth upset win over the 13th-ranked Georgetown Hoyas on Monday night at Madison Square Garden.

Dwight Hardy went 10 for 10 from the free-throw line, including nailing two with 2.8 seconds left on the clock to ice the game. Mr. Hardy led the Red Storm with 20 points, and Mr. Brownlee tacked on 15 points of his own. 

St. John's, which has now won five straight, took a six-point lead into halftime, but it didn't hold, as the two teams exchanged the lead several times in a tight final minute of play.
