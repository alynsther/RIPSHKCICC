Owners of New York City rental apartment buildings had good reason to celebrate the fourth quarter: the vacancy rate was down and average rents rose.

The market was strong despite a surge of new supply coming on the market in 2010. According to Reis, developers delivered 7,118 units last year. That was way up from 1,377 the previous year and the largest volume since 1987. 

Part of the reason volume was so high last year was because developers were able to restart projects that were stalled during the early years of the downturn. Reis is projecting that only 1,422 units will be delivered this year.
