LONDON—European stocks dropped after data showing a surprise decline in the British economy soured sentiment. Investors gave a frosty welcome to Spain's plan to strengthen its banking sector. 

Still, there were some strong performers, including telecom-equipment group Ericsson, which climbed after reporting strong results. 

The Stoxx Europe 600 index fell 0.7% to 280.10, following the release of U.K. gross domestic product data. A weak start to Wall Street trading helped cement Europe's losses. 

The U.K. figures showed GDP contracted 0.5% in the fourth quarter compared to the previous quarter. Economists had been expecting a 0.4% rise. 

The announcement weighed on the U.K. FTSE 100 index, which closed down 0.4% to 5917.71, with banks and retailers among the weakest performers. Sterling tumbled and U.K. government bonds jumped as expectations for the next U.K. interest-rate increase shifted from July to September.

Shares in Lloyds Banking Group fell 2.9%, while Tesco, the word's third-largest retailer, slipped 1.6%. 

Paul Kavanagh, a director at brokerage Killik & Co., said stocks with the greatest exposure to the British economy were being hit hard by the disappointment over the growth rate. But he said in the coming weeks the weak data could also offer support to some stocks, as it also means interest rates are likely to stay lower for longer. 

"One of the key risks for this year is how we exit from this accommodative policy," said Mr. Kavanagh. "The talk had moved towards a June or July rate hike, but this pushes that back." 

Banks were also lower elsewhere in Europe, led by losses for the Spanish lenders Banco Santander and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, which dropped 3.1% and 2.9%, respectively, after Spanish authorities late Monday set out a plan to recapitalize the nation's unlisted savings banks, known as cajas. 

The banks will be given until September to raise capital themselves or be forced to take money from the government. The government's estimate that the banks will need no more than €20 billion is well below the range of €30 billion to €90 billion range other observers have said would be required.

"The amount appears sharply below market and our expectations," said Deutsche Bank. "Our European economists believe that the Cajas [local Spanish banks] need around €75 billion to provide a comfortable capital buffer."

The falls for Santander and BBVA helped pull Spain's IBEX 35 index down 1.4%. 

Other European banks also fell, with UniCredit SpA dropping 2.5% in Milan. Italy's FTSE MIB index fell 1%, while Portugal's PSI 20 index fell 1.3% and the Greek ASE Composite declined 0.9%. 

Shares in Ericsson rose 2.5% in Stockholm in response to its fourth-quarter results. The firm's profit fell slightly short of market expectations, but stronger-than-expected sales helped boost the stock. 

In Frankfurt, shares of Siemens retreated from earlier gains to finish down 0.3% after the industrial giant and economic bellwether reported a 16% rise in first-quarter net profit to €1.72 billion ($2.35 billion), driven by strong growth in emerging markets. The profit beat the consensus profit forecast of €1.52 billion. 

The German DAX 30 index edged down 0.1% to 7,059.01, while the French CAC 40 index fell 0.3% to 4,019.62. 

Shares in car maker Renault rose 1.2% after reports that the company will target an operating margin of 5% and further savings from its relationship with Nissan Motor Co. 

Shares in STMicroelectronics, however, dropped 4.5% after the group said late Monday it expects revenue in the current quarter to fall between 7% and 12% sequentially. The stock is still up around 50% from a low in October. 

Other technology stocks were mostly higher after Texas Instruments Inc. late Monday reported strong earnings growth. 

Shares in chip-equipment maker ASML Holding rose 4.2% in Amsterdam.

In late afternoon, the euro was trading at $1.3625, down from $1.3645 late Monday in New York. The dollar was at 82.40 yen, down from 82.49 yen. Sterling traded at $1.5802, down sharply from $1.6001 late Monday in New York but above the day's $1.5752 low. 

Gold and oil both fell sharply. As European equity markets closed, gold on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange was down $17.40 per ounce to $1327.10. Light, sweet, crude for March delivery was down $1.29 at $86.58 on Nymex.
