European stock markets fell Thursday, dragged down by a weakened financial sector amid disappointing earnings from Lloyds Banking Group and Société Générale.

The euro dropped on comments by European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet after the lender kept interest rates unchanged. 

The Stoxx Europe 600 closed down 0.3% at 277.79. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 index lost 1.1% to 5919.98, Germany's DAX index was nearly flat at 7376.96, and France's CAC-40 index dropped 0.9% at 4004.87. 

Around the European market close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.5% at 12,654 and the S&P 500 was down 0.3% at 1342.89. 

Mr. Trichet avoided giving any clear indication that the bank will raise its interest rates again next month, but warned of continuing upward pressures on inflation. At the news conference after the ECB governing council's monthly meeting, Mr. Trichet also repeated his opposition to any restructuring of sovereign debt in the euro zone, and welcomed the three-year, €78 billion ($116 billion) aid package for Portugal.

ECB-watchers argue that Mr. Trichet has traditionally signaled an imminent rate increase by calling for "strong vigilance" against inflation. He avoided that phrase both in his introductory statement and in his answers to subsequent questions. In late Europe trading, the common currency was fetching $1.4631 against the greenback, from $1.4868 late in New York on Wednesday. 

Bank shares were the biggest drag in the stock markets. Lloyds slumped 8% in London after it set aside £3.2 billion ($5.28 billion) to cover the potential costs of customer payouts over improperly sold payment-protection insurance, resulting in a £2.44 billion net loss in the first quarter. 

Société Générale dropped 5% in Paris after it reported a 14% fall in first-quarter net profit, missing forecasts, as it took a hit on the value of its own debt.

In Madrid, shares of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria slid 1.5% after it reported a 7.5% fall in first-quarter net profit, hurt by higher loan-impairment costs. 

The Stoxx Europe 600 banks index fell 1.1%.

Resources and energy stocks reversed earlier gains to trade marginally lower, with the Stoxx Europe 600 resources index down 0.8% and the index for oil and gas off 1.2%. 

Weaker-than-expected German manufacturing orders added to the downcast mood. Figures showed orders fell 4% in March, against expectations for them to remain flat. 

The Bank of England left rates unchanged at 0.5%, following recent weak economic data. 

"Hardly surprising," said  Nick Beecroft, senior markets consultant at Saxo Bank, citing weak purchasing managers index data in the U.K., released Thursday. "Add weak house prices, mortgage lending, money supply figures, and dire predictions from the high street, and you get the picture," he added.

The release of the U.K. services purchasing managers index for April fell to 54.3 in April from 57.1 in March, worse than expectations for a reading of 55.5. 

"Business expectations fell to its lowest level since December, which adds to worries about growth in the months ahead and reduces the likelihood of firms investing and hiring new workers," said  James Knightley at ING. "This suggests weak growth will persist through this year and implies that the BOE will need to cut its [gross domestic product] projections, which will further delay the prospect of interest-rate rises." 

In the U.S., initial jobless claims rose by 43,000 last week compared with forecasts of claims falling by 14,000. Traders said the weaker labor-market data didn't bode well for Friday's key U.S. nonfarm-payrolls report.

Elsewhere, spot gold traded down $26.60 at $1,488.70 a troy ounce. June Nymex crude oil futures were down $6.13 at $103.11 per barrel.
