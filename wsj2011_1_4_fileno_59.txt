The Giants finished with 10 wins. The Seahawks finished with seven. Back in Week 9, the Giants pounded the Seahawks 41-7. But Seattle won its division, and the Giants didn't win a wild card. So the Seahawks are going to the playoffs while the Giants aren't. New York coach Tom Coughlin refused to lodge any complaints with the NFL's playoff system in general, saying that it has largely "been a good one because…you focus on winning your division."

Still, he wasn't all company man, laughingly admitting, "From a standpoint of being selfish right now, yeah, we'd like to be playing."

Knicks small forward Danilo Gallinari is out for two to three weeks with a sprained left knee. The injury occurred on Sunday when Pacers guard Brandon Rush fell into his leg. After the game, Mr. Gallinari said he could walk but still felt discomfort.

In his absence, Knicks coach Mike D'Antoni said that center Ronny Turiaf will enter the starting lineup for Tuesday's game against the Spurs, while normal starting center Amar'e Stoudemire will play power forward and Wilson Chandler will play small forward.

Pedro Feliciano, who led Major League Baseball in appearances each of the past three years as a reliable left-handed reliever for the Mets, officially joined the Yankees on Monday, signing a two-year contract with them.

The deal includes a club option for 2013, according to the Yankees. Mr. Feliciano, 34 years old, had a 3.30 earned-run average in 92 games for the Mets last season.

Mr. Feliciano has pitched in 459 major-league games, all with the Mets, and over his career, left-handed batters have hit just .214 against him. His 266 appearances over the past three seasons are the most over any three-year span in major-league history.
