MUMBAIâ€”Indian shares closed slightly higher Monday as technology shares gained ahead of the earnings announcement of Tata Consultancy Services, the country's largest software company by revenue, but stocks of  Anil Ambani-run firms tumbled after they settled a case with the regulators. 

The Bombay Stock Exchange's Sensitive Index rose 21.81 points, or 0.1%, to close at 18882.25 after moving between 18779.38 and 19018.94. On the National Stock Exchange, the 50-stock S&P CNX Nifty gained 0.2 points to end at 5654.75. On Friday, the benchmark had closed at a four-month low of 18860.44. 

 Anil Ambani's Firms: Will Shares Keep Falling? 

Trading volume on the BSE fell to 30.46 billion rupees from Friday's 31.43 billion rupees. Gainers lagged decliners 862 to 1986, while 149 stocks were unchanged. 

Asian markets ended mostly lower Monday. China's Shanghai Composite slid 3%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng and Korea's Kospi fell 0.5% and 0.4%, respectively. 

The Sensex had fallen 673.66 points in the two previous sessions on concerns that persistently high inflation would put pressure on the country's central bank to aggressively hike interest rates. 

"This was a highly volatile session but we closed flat. On the one hand, expectations of good third-quarter earnings were a positive, but fears of high inflation and monetary policy tightening in China weighed on markets," said  Alex Mathews, head of research at Geojit BNP Paribas Financial Services. Sentiment is still weak and the market is likely to see further volatility in coming days, he added. 

Of the 30 Sensex constituents, 13 stocks closed higher. 

Gains were led by Sensex heavyweight  Infosys Technologies, which closed 2.1% higher at 3,267.95 rupees. "The stock fell following weaker-than-expected third-quarter results [last week], and we think it could drift lower and stay range bound until April," Morgan Stanley said in a research note. 

The house said Infosys is a stock it would like to own in the current uncertain environment. 

Tata Consultancy, which is due to announce earnings later on Monday, rose 1.7% to 1,138.15 rupees, while Wipro closed 0.7% up at 466.15 rupees. 

Housing Development Finance bounced from Friday's sharp fall as traders looked to cover short positions. The stock ended 3.2% higher at 661.75 rupees after falling 4% on Friday despite reporting better-than-expected 33% growth in its third-quarter net profit. 

Among others,  HDFC Bank gained 1.1% to 2,075.3 rupees, while State Bank of India ended 0.6% up at 2,516.45 rupees. 

Sensex losers were led by Larsen & Toubro following concerns over new orders, despite the engineering company reporting better-than-expected 10.8% growth in its October-December net profit. The stock closed 1.7% down at 1,681.15 rupees. 

Companies founded by Anil Ambani closed sharply lower. The Indian billionaire and four directors of his group's two companies agreed not to invest in the capital market until December 2011 as part of a settlement with the market regulator of charges of misusing funds raised abroad. 

Reliance Infrastructure lost 7.8% to 735.7 rupees and Reliance Communications fell 4.8% to 131.8, while Reliance Power closed 6.1% lower at 137.9 rupees.
