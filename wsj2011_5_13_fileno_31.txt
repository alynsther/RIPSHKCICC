DETROIT—Michigan's state legislature Thursday passed a broad new tax structure ending a raft of tax credits, replacing the state's complex business tax with a flat corporate tax, while imposing a new pension tax and raising income taxes on residents. 

The tax plan—central to Gov. Rick Snyder's budget plan—narrowly passed the state Senate with Lt. Gov. Brian Calley casting the tie-breaking vote, according to the Associated Press. The bill will now move to the governor's office for his signature. 

"Michigan's complex, unwieldy and unfair tax structure has been a major impediment to economic growth," Mr. Snyder said in a statement. 

Mr. Snyder aims to wrap up discussion of his proposed budget by the end of May as he seeks to revitalize a state that has been dogged by a weak economy, high unemployment and population loss. The Republican governor had to make changes to his proposed tax plan to placate lawmakers in his own party who balked at several elements particularly raising the tax on pensions. 

Democratic lawmakers have slammed the new tax code for giving businesses a break while raising taxes on the working poor and seniors. The bill replaced the Michigan Business Tax with a 6% flat corporate income tax and will reduce corporate income taxes by $1 billion for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. 

Seven Republican state senators voted against the bill, while all 17 Democratic senators did, according to the AP.
