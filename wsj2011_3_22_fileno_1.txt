New Delhi -- Steel-pipe manufacturer Jindal Saw Ltd expects to acquire a European pipe manufacturer in the next three to four months to bolster its business in Europe, a senior executive said. 

Managing Director  Indresh Batra said in a recent interview that the proposed acquisition, which could cost up to 1.5 billion rupees, is largely aimed at widening its range of products and increase its market share in the European pipes market. 

The Indian company, which gets nearly two-thirds of its revenues from overseas sales, is banking on increasing demand for oil and gas products globally to drive the sales of its steel pipes. 

The company has sufficient cash to fund its acquisition, and will not dilute equity in the near-term to raise money, Mr. Batra said.

The current favorable interest regime overseas could encourage the company to undertake $70 million to $100 million in external commercial borrowings during the April to June quarter.

Jindal Saw expects to post around 30% growth in net profit and sales in the next financial year beginning April 1, largely due to an expansion of sales to the oil and gas sector.

Batra added that the company currently has outstanding orders of 50 billion rupees, which it plans to execute over the next 10 months to 12 months.
