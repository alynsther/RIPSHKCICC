Super-heated commodities markets stumbled badly last week and, momentarily, took the stock market with them. But the sudden rout ended with a surprisingly strong April jobs report on Friday morning.

Thursday's carnage: Oil prices fell 8.6% to $99.80 a barrel, and silver dropped 8% to $36.23 an ounce. Copper, gold and wheat tumbled, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 1%.

But early Friday, the Labor Department surprised a dour Wall Street with news that 244,000 jobs were added in the last month.

Ebullience quickly returned to the market. Stock prices soared through the morning before retreating.

Despite Friday's gains, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.3% for the week. Oil prices fell 15%, closing at $97.18 a barrel. Silver closed Friday at $35.28 an ounce, a fall of 27% for the week -- the metal's largest percent decline in more than 30 years. Gold fell 4.2%, and copper lost 4.9%.

One silver lining (so to speak): The sharp decline in oil prices could bring some relief at the pump, where gasoline prices have risen to $4-plus a gallon.
