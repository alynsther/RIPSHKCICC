's iPad the declining market leader, researcher Strategy Analytics estimated Monday. 

It also said tablets based on  Google Inc.'s Android operating system won share from the iPad and predicted the trajectory would continue in the first half. 

Apple released its iPad last year, and its popularity has stoked both mobile-device and PC makers to develop tablets of their own to share the demand. 

In the fourth quarter, tablet shipments rose to 9.7 million from 4.4 million in the third quarter, according to the data. Though Apple dominated with a 75% market share in the most recent period, its percentage dropped from 96%. Android, on the other hand, saw its market share grow to 22% from just 2.3%. 

Strategy Analytics Director  Neil Mawston said Samsung Electronics Co.'s Galaxy Tab "was the main driver of Android's success, as the model was launched in dozens of countries and promoted heavily by Samsung." 

He added that tablet makers are attracted to Android's "perceived low cost" and range of media services, like YouTube and Google Maps. Google provides Android software free to hardware makers, aiming to expand its share of the mobile ad market by increasing the system's usership. 

Strategy Analytics also said that with several models from major vendors in the pipeline, the growing base of tablets will make the Android an increasingly popular platform for media developers.
