 After adjusting for warrants that AIG issued in January, AIG's share price has fallen 36% year-to-date. A chart that accompanied a Business & Finance article in some editions Thursday incorrectly said the stock had fallen 47% so far this year. The 47% decline corresponds to the stock's decrease not accounting for the warrant issue.
