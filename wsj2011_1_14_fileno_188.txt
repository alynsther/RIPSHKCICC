Assets in money-market funds fell $2.18 billion for the week ended Wednesday, as retail-fund outflows more than offset the money added to institutional funds, according to the Investment Company Institute. 

Cash has been moving in and out of the funds in recent months after hundreds of billions of dollars had been pulled from money-market funds in the first half of the year as investors sought higher returns. Recent turmoil in the municipal-bond market has sent some investors to money funds. 

For the week ended Wednesday, total fund assets dropped to $2.796 trillion, according to ICI. 

Assets in the institutional class increased $4.39 billion to $1.856 trillion. Taxable government funds dropped $6.62 billion, putting asset levels at $650.97 billion. Nongovernment funds had inflows of $13.49 billion, moving their asset levels up to $1.081 trillion. Tax-exempt funds declined $2.47 billion to $123.91 billion. 

Meanwhile, retail (or individual-investor-focused) funds had net outflows of $6.58 billion, putting asset levels at $940.65 billion. Taxable government funds declined $1 billion to $165.84 billion, while nongovernment funds had $4.24 billion of outflows, lowering the amount in them to $567.55 billion. Tax-exempt funds decreased $1.34 billion to $207.27 billion.
