 Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, 48, who became famous as a student dissident calling for the removal of Soviet troops from his country in 1989 and who swept to power after a landslide victory in April elections, spoke Wednesday with The Wall Street Journal. Below are edited excerpts from the interview. 

 On the euro: "The most important thing is to defend the euro. The strongest institution in the hands of the European Union is the euro. The euro must be defended or uncertainty about the European Union will be widespread."

 On EU enlargement: "If you look at a map, the present situation is not sustainable … For a workable, liveable, regulated union, we need those countries" to the east and in the Balkans. Progress on membership for Croatia is important "to make it credible that there are European prospects for Balkan countries." 

 On relations with the central bank: "It's a very complicated relationship to balance … We disagree on many points, especially how to reduce indebtedness."

 On politics: "I was there from the very first moment, and saw how democracy and freedom were created in Hungary … We made compromises that turned out to be bad or short-sighted … The country moved ahead more slowly that it had the capacity to do." 

"We have to understand that Hungarians cannot live in the way we have lived until now. And to change the country and to reorganize the country is easier with a strong majority in parliament." 

 On Hungary's former communist leaders: "Hungarian communists were the most talented. They convinced everybody that reforming the communist party was better than making a new party."
