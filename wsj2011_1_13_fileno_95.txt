Enough already about which NFL team will win the Super Bowl. Let's focus on an important question: Which set of announcers is most likely to give you a headache?

A study this season by The Count looked at every major NFL announcing outfit and counted how many words-per-minute the play-by-play and color men said. Hats off to CBS's Kevin Harlan and Solomon Wilcots, who amassed 189.2 words per minute in our study. NBC's Al Michaels and Cris Collinsworth, the preeminent present-day announcer team, were the quietest at 137.33 words per minute.

This analysis, which studied the first 15 minutes of every game from Week 1, showed Mr. Harlan was the most-talkative play-by-play man at 120.9 words-per-minute, while Kenny Albert was the quietest at 55.4. On the color side, Daryl Johnston spoke at a league-leading 99.3 wpm, and Ron Jaworski talked the least at 30.4 (note: he's part of a three-man booth).

There's a tendency to assume today's announcers are more chatty than their predecessors, but that's not always true. Pat Summerall and John Madden only churned out 118.2 wpm—fewer than any announcer pair today—during Super Bowl XXIV, but Frank Gifford, Howard Cosell and Don Meredith combined for 175.5 in a 1979 game. That would be good for third-most this year. Then there's Dennis Miller. He only said 15.8 wpm in a Monday Night Football Game in 2000. The problem was, those words accounted for roughly one million syllables.
