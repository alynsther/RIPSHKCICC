MUMBAI --Reliance Communications said it drew down on the second tranche of $400 million, or 17.8 billion rupees, of a $1.93 billion loan facility from China Development Bank. 

The drawn down amount will be used to refinance the company's short-term rupee borrowings, which were made to purchase licenses for third-generation mobile phone spectrum last year. 

The company will save on interest costs of up to 5 billion rupees a year, Reliance Communications said in a press release, without elaborating. 

In March, the Indian telecom services company said it had drawn down its first tranche of $665 million of the loan. 

Reliance Communications took the loan from the Chinese bank to pat $1.33 billion to refinance the spectrum fee and $600 million for equipment imports from Chinese vendors.
