MUMBAI -- SKS Microfinance Ltd., the country's only listed micro lender, Friday swung to a fourth quarter net loss of 697.7 million rupees ($15.6 million) from a net profit of 628.9 million rupees as stringent local rules hit cash recoveries in one of its largest markets, leading to a surge in provisions and write offs.

Microfinance companies borrow funds from banks and offer small ticket loans of about $200 to the poor to help them start or expand their small businesses.

The industry came under a cloud after the southern state of Andhra Pradesh -- the largest market for the industry -- decided to impose tight regulations on micro lenders on allegations that they overcharged customers and used coercive methods for recovery. The tough laws and the political movement that followed dismantled the repayment cycle for micro lenders here.

Total income for January-March period fell 36% year-on-year to 1.94 billion rupees from 3.04 billion rupees, the south India based company said in a filing to the stock exchanges. The loss could have been higher had it not been for a tax benefit of 349.6 million rupees.

Provisions and write offs surged to 1.06 billion rupees from 148.2 million rupees a year earlier.

Staff costs rose 5% to 683.3 million rupees while interest and finance expenses inched up 6% to 868.1 million rupees.

"We took a decision to adopt a stringent provisioning norms in pursuance of our leadership role," S Dilliraj, chief financial officer said in the statement.

As a fallout of the turmoils in Andhra Pradesh, J.P. Morgan slashed the company's target price to 200 rupees from 550 rupees while maintaining an underweight call, sending its shares to a record low of 330.65 rupees on the Bombay Stock Exchange.

It closed 19.8% lower at 331.30 rupees as compared with a 1.7% gain in the main 30-stock index. The company had raised about 16.54 billion rupees via an initial public offer in August 2008 -- issuing equity shares at 985 rupees each.

Ahead of the earnings, J.P Morgan has forecast a net loss of 7 billion rupees in the current financial year that began April 1, weighed by loan write-offs in Andhra Pradesh.

SKS reported a net profit of 1.12 billion rupees in the last financial year.

"This is expected to shrink equity by 40%, bring equity/assets down to a precarious 22-23% and probably entail a recap - unless SKS gets relief on non-performing loans accounting," the report said.

SKS said despite a serious setback in the recovery in Andhra Pradesh, its financial position remains sound.

As of March 31, the micro lender had cash and bank balances worth 5.58 billion rupees.
