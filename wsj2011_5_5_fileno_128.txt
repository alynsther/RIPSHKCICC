The single policy change that would help the business climate for Silicon Valley companies: improving schools, according to executives surveyed by the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, a trade association for regional businesses. In the survey, conducted in December 2010 and January 2011, 71% of 175 respondents said efforts by local governments to improve K-12 education would boost the business climate for their company, while 54% said similar state efforts would do the same. The focus on education comes as recent studies indicate a deterioration of the nation's ability to produce high-quality science students, with an even weaker performance in California, a pattern that could make the region noncompetitive because of a lack of a trained work force, according to the Silicon Valley group. Other priorities: reducing public-pension costs and approving more affordable-home developments.
