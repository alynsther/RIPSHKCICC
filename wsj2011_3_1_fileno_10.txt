DETROITâ€”In what may be a last-ditch effort to save their season, the striking musicians of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra voted Tuesday to return to work without a contract if management agrees to enter into binding arbitration. 

The musicians agreed to work under the conditions management has imposed while continuing negotiations, musician spokesman Greg Bowens said. 

"It was a gut-wrenching decision," Mr. Bowens said. "We'll see if management accepts the hand of friendship or slaps us in the face instead."

DSO management had no comment on whether it will accept the terms and reinstate the remaining performances it had suspended. 

"We're very encouraged by today's unanticipated announcement and welcome receiving the union's proposal so we can discuss the details under which the musicians would return to work," DSO spokeswoman Elizabeth Weigandt said in a statement.

The DSO last month suspended its remaining performances for the 2010-2011 season and said the fate of 2011-2012 remained in limbo after the musicians overwhelming turned down a "final" offer that demanded wage and benefit cuts. The two sides had said they wanted to continue talking, although no new meetings have been scheduled. 

The musicians have been on strike since October after DSO management asked for hefty pay cuts amid the organization's growing deficit. The DSO, hurt by a loss of donations and attendance as the Michigan economy works to recover, estimates it will be broke in two years if it doesn't curtail costs. 

Under the last proposal, base salaries which would drop to $80,000 from more $104,650 in 2010. Another $7,100 would be available to each musician who volunteered for "outreach work," which includes playing in-school concerts and teaching music.
