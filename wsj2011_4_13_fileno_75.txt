The Queens Museum of Art officially broke ground Tuesday on the $65 million expansion project that will add 50,000 square feet to the institution. The added space will house new galleries, classrooms, public event spaces, plus a café and shop.

Part of the exterior will also be transformed into a work of public art: A 220-foot long illuminated glass façade, conceived as a large-scale installation, is to be placed on the side of the building facing the Grand Central Parkway. "More than 250,000 people a day pass by the museum," said executive director Tom Finkelpearl. "That's our greatest opportunity in terms of visibility."

The museum is currently hidden from Parkway drivers by trees. They will be moved, but Mr. Finkelpearl emphasized that the tree count will stay the same. "We had to assure everyone that there will not be any fewer trees," he said.

Located in Flushing Meadows Corona Park, the museum is housed in the building originally erected as the city's official pavilion for the 1939 World's Fair. But for years, it has occupied only half the structure; until 2009, the other half was used by the World's Fair Ice Rink. The renovation, designed by Grimshaw Architects, will convert the ice-rink area—roughly the size of an airplane hanger—into museum spaces.

Amid all the changes, one thing will stay the same. "The panorama will not move," Mr. Finkelpearl said of the museum's 9,335-square-foot architectural model of New York. "The museum is situated around the panorama, but it is going to be rebalanced."

The renovation, scheduled to be complete by 2013, will be accomplished with appropriations for $48 million from the city, $15 million from the state, and museum fund-raising.
