Seeking to prevent an expected spike in electricity bills next month, New York Gov.  Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor  Michael Bloomberg are offering legislation that would let the city guarantee property tax abatements for power plants.

New York officials have been trying to convince federal regulators to reverse themselves on findings earlier this year that are expected to lead to a 12% increase in charges to consumers.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission concluded months ago that power producers in the New York area should be allowed to charge more, due to the possibility of having to pay more in property taxes.

New York leaders say that is unfair because most power plants in the area don't pay any property taxes and aren't likely to have to pay any in the future. Mr. Cuomo said in a statement he hoped the proposed legislation would leave federal regulators "no choice" but to reverse their decision. 

"When the commission proposed a hike in New Yorkers' energy bills that was based on false assumptions, and which would provide no benefits to consumers, we immediately raised a red flag," Mr. Bloomberg said in a statement. "Now, by amending the existing tax benefits, we are removing any and all justification for this decision.''

A FERC spokesman said Tuesday it has not decided whether to rehear the matter.

The electricity industry is regulated to try to ensure the system can handle the nation's power needs and avoid blackouts. FERC's decision centers largely around encouraging enough electricity generation to avoid overtaxing the electrical grid. But consumer advocates say that in trying to make the business appealing for power companies, the agency has given them too much.
