Since Danji opened in Hell's Kitchen in December, the contemporary Korean restaurant has stuck to its ethos of seasonality and then some. "The menu has changed every week," admitted chef-owner Hooni Kim, leaning on spicy, hearty dishes in winter. "And it's gotten bigger."

Last month, Danji expanded to offer lunch. Start with lightly battered calamari with wasabi may ($8) and vegetable dumplings ($7 for five), made by a family friend of Mr. Kim's. Stuffed with potato-starch vermicelli, minced tofu, carrots and onions, they're fried a blistery gold-brown and served with spicy soy. 

"I've wanted to use her dumplings for a very long time," said Mr. Kim, a veteran of Daniel and Masa. 

Danji offers three dosirak set lunches, which include soup, banchan (a rotation of kimchi, sauteed spinach, caramelized anchovies and other sides) and a choice of main dish over rice. There's always brisket bulgogi ($14) and vegetarian japchae (glassy, sweet potato-starch noodles with julienne vegetables, $12), plus a protein of the day.
