NEW DELHI --It's difficult to think beyond the momentous news of the day: The killing of Osama Bin Laden. 

But there are happenings in the deal world that do merit attention starting with the meeting Monday evening of an Indian ministerial panel to discuss Cairn Energy's proposal to sell a majority stake in its India unit to London-based miner Vedanta Resources.

The panel, headed by Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee, is expected to send its recommendations to the federal cabinet on the deal that was proposed last August. Other panel members include Oil Minister Jaipal Reddy, Telecommunications Minister Kapil Sibal, Law Minister Veerappa Moily and Planning Commission Deputy Chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia.

After the lukewarm response to the Future Ventures India's initial public offering last week, the prospect of a flood of other share sales seems dim. Now, add to that the latest move by domestic investment banks to not do IPOs of public-sector utilities for near-zero costs, we really are looking at some slow times ahead. Last week, the Indian government said it expects to raise $9 billion through such share sales, with the first expected by the end of this month.

On the deals front, cash-rich Indian companies are much in demand in other parts of the world. Recently, a Morocco-India trade discussion sought Indian companies to invest in the African nation. That continent offers Indian companies an emerging market where they can be part of the growth story.

Back home, talks on the sale of Henkel AG's stake in Henkel India to Jyothy Labs still continues.
