Down at the Mondrian, Kidada Jones, the designer daughter of Quincy Jones and Peggy Lipton, celebrated the launch of her line of clothing and accessories for the Disney Store. 

The first batch is based on four characters: Snow White, Cinderella, Tiana (from "The Princess and the Frog") and Belle (from "Beauty and the Beast"). 

On top of creating T-shirts and a watch, Ms. Jones designed what she is calling "Wish a Littles." They are small, tubby reinterpretations of the princesses. Each has a necklace inside and a place to hide a wish. When the necklace falls off, "your wish comes true," Ms. Jones said. 

The concept is designed, she added, for different personalities and milestones. 

Tiana is about "blossoming at unexpected times and in murky waters," she explained. Belle is about "ringing in the new chapter." Cinderella is about "being patient and your time is yet to come." Snow White, she finished, is about "waiting for the right moment." Coming this fall are collectible versions of Ariel, Tinkerbell, Alice and Princess Jasmine. 

The penthouse at the Mondrian was covered with lots of pink and filled with donuts, brightly colored cupcakes and French macarons. Ms. Jones, said, however, that she isn't one for sweets. Instead, she (and her mother and sister, the actress Rashida Jones) has a compulsion for chewing sugarless gum. 

At the current moment, her three favorite flavors, she said, are Extra's Sweet Watermelon, "because it's reminiscent of a Bubblicious," but without the sugar; Trident's Pina Colada, which has that "great tropical taste of when you get a little suntan lotion in your mouth accidentally," and Wrigley's 5 Rain. "That's like gum you chew at the club," Ms. Jones said. "Long lasting flavor and great texture, much more so than Doublemint."
