When Masaaki Suzuki sits down at the harpsichord Friday at Carnegie Hall, he will conclude his recital with two pieces by Johann Sebastian Bach. They're familiar, lifelong companions. As a conductor heading the Bach Collegium Japan, Maestro Suzuki is considered one of the foremost interpreters in the world of Bach's choral music.

His love affair with Bach began at age 12 at home in Japan, when he received as a gift from his father a recording of the Mass in B Minor conducted by Karl Richter, the famed German interpreter of Bach. "It was a great shock to me," Mr. Suzuki said. "It was a revelation, even though I couldn't understand then what it meant. I listened to it every night after my family went to sleep. I couldn't stop." 

Mr. Suzuki, 57 years old Friday, focuses so intensely on Bach that in 20 years of leading the ensemble, he's never attempted the great religious music of Mozart, Beethoven and others. "Maybe Mozart's Requiem in three years," he says. "And I'd love to do Mendelssohn." 

Mr. Suzuki 's greatest love is the Mass in B Minor, which he and the Collegium have recorded, and performed a month ago at Carnegie Hall. He notes that this mass is a work of great mystery. To this day, he points out, no one knows why Bach wrote it, a piece of Catholic liturgy by a Lutheran in a Lutheran country, too long to be performed as part of a church service. Bach had no commission for it and no sponsor, and there's no evidence it was performed in his lifetime. Mr. Suzuki speculates that Bach might have been attempting "to make a great compilation of his life, to sum his whole life up."

On May 6, Mr. Suzuki will conduct a combined Juilliard-Yale University orchestra and chorus in Bach's St. Matthew Passion in New Haven, Conn., with a New York performance the next day. Both are free.
