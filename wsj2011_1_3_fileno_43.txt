BANGALORE -- U.S.-listed software company  iGate Corp. Monday cancelled a press conference where it had said it would announce a "significant corporate development."

Market watchers were expecting the company to go public about a potential deal to buy a stake in  Patni Computer Systems Ltd.

  Phaneesh Murthy, president and chief executive of iGate, was to address Monday's news conference.

iGate officials didn't immediately provide a reason for cancelling the press conference.

A consortium of private equity firm Apax Partners and iGate has bid close to 500 rupees ($11.2) a share to buy the combined 63% stake in Patni Computer being sold by the technology company's founders and private equity firm General Atlantic, three people familiar with the matter said last week.

The iGate-Apax bid values Patni Computer at 65.49 billion rupees ($1.46 billion).

A 63% stake would cost about 41.26 billion rupees at this price.
