NEW YORK—Stocks rose as fears of increased violence in Libya scaled back, currency interventions helped relieve pressure on Japan's economy and some big U.S. banks raised their dividends.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished with a gain of 83.85 points, or 0.71%, to close at 11858.44, ending a week of tumultuous trading that briefly sent blue chips into negative territory for the year on Wednesday.

 rose 1.7% after gaining regulators' approval for capital distribution plans. 

The Nasdaq Composite closed 7.62 higher, or 0.29%, at 2643.67. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 5.48, or 0.43%, to 1279.20, led by financial shares. 

Stocks pulled back from their highs of the day on Friday afternoon as traders prepared their portfolios to ride out a potentially turbulent weekend.

"There's some caution heading into the weekend," said  Jim Herrick, director of equity trading at  R.W. Baird. "We had some good news coming out of the financial sector with banks boosting dividends and we saw a rally there, but there's still some geopolitical issues."

After tumbling for the week's first three days, stocks rose Thursday and added further gains Friday. The latest came after Libya's foreign minister said Col. Moammar Gadhafi's regime had declared an immediate cease-fire in the wake of the United Nations resolution passed late Thursday authorizing military action against Gadhafi's security forces.

President Barack Obama on Friday said the U.S. won't deploy ground troops to Libya but vowed that America wouldn't "stand idly by" as attacks against rebels continued.

While those political developments helped keep crude-oil prices around $101 a barrel, investors braced for further developments in North Africa.

"It makes sense to be ready for anything coming from Libya," said Lawrence Creatura, portfolio manager at Federated Investors, noting that Gadhafi's "historic behavior doesn't engender a lot of trust."

The nuclear power crisis that unfurled in the wake of Japan's earthquake and tsunami last week has also contributed to deep anxieties.

"Not only is the nuclear situation not stabilized, but also the ripple effects through the global supply chain have not yet been revealed," Mr. Creatura said.

 said disruptions in its Japanese supply chain could sporadically affect its assembly plants elsewhere and that it is trying to secure other sources for parts normally produced in Japan. Shares of Caterpillar rose 1.9%.

Meanwhile, the Group of Seven moved to stem "excess volatility and disorderly movements" in the currency markets after the yen's dramatic swings this week, sending the dollar soaring against the Japanese currency.

A stronger yen had dealt added pressure to Japan's economy by making its exports more expensive abroad. The intervention is expected to aid Japanese exporters and boost the country's recovery effort.

Friday morning, the Federal Reserve confirmed it had bought dollars against the yen, boosting the greenback versus the Japanese currency.
