FC Barcelona held off Real Madrid to reach the Champions League final after a 3-1 aggregate semifinal win. Barcelona, which held a two-goal lead after last week's first leg in Madrid, secured a 1-1 draw Tuesday in an ill-tempered, stop-start game. Pedro Rodriguez scored for Barcelona before a too-little-too-late goal by Madrid's Marcelo. Barcelona's opponent in the May 28 final is likely Manchester United, which holds an advantage in its semi.

Mucho Macho Man, a Kentucky Derby contender on Saturday, has picked up a fitting sponsor for the three legs of the Triple Crown: 3M. "People call him everything—MMM, 3M or M3—but 3M is sort of sticking now," said the colt's majority owner, Patti Reeves, who spent 14 years as a 3M employee. The deal came about after Reeves inquired by calling the company's 1-800 number.
