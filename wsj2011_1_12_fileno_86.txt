After an eight-year war in the 1980s, the rivalry between Iran and Iraq is still fierce. Pitted in an opening-round game in the Asian Cup in Qatar, a screen was erected between Iraqi and Iranian supporters.

Iran snatched a late goal to win 2-1 after Iman Mobali's 84th-minute free kick.

Antoine Walker hasn't played in the NBA since 2008. But the 34-year-old veteran has been averaging 17.3 points and 6.5 rebounds for the Idaho Stampede of the NBA's Development League. He's playing in the D-League Showcase this week with some offspring of New York sporting legends. D.J. Strawberry, Patrick Ewing Jr., and Anthony Mason are all on rosters.
