MUMBAI -- Sequoia Capital India Advisors and IDG Ventures India Advisors have invested $5 million each in Sourcebits Inc, a third-party mobile and tablet applications developer. Sourcebits will use the money to set up its U.S. development center and other expansions.

Sequoia and IDG will get a board seat each in the company, and will be invested for five to seven years, the company said. Sourcebits refused to divulge the stake it sold to the two investors.

"We expect the mobile app business to be (worth) $35 billion by 2014 and hence the phenomenal growth will help Sourcebits develop into a bigger player in the market," said  Manik Arora, founder and managing director of IDG Ventures India. 

Sourcebits has 300 employees in India, Europe, Russia and the U.S., and has developed downloadable applications for the iPhone, iPad, Blackberry and Android-based phones.
