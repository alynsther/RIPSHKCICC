The annual Girl Scouts of Greater New York gala offered perhaps the most desirable goodie bag of the season: free cookies. "I don't think I can keep any of these things in my house," said one of the night's honorees, Gwenn L. Carr, Executive Vice President of MetLife. "They're dangerous."

Well, that was as risqu√© as the dinner at Gotham Hall got. There was an undeniable wholesomeness to the evening: record-shattering ticket sales, endearing uniformed Scout greeters, dietetic menu items (asparagus shots, anyone?), and inspirational pep talks, one after another. Even the emcee, Deborah Norville, was a former Scout. 

Some of the young local overachievers were invited to the dinner. Carolina Torres, 17, of Queens, has traveled to Savannah, Ga., with the organization. "I want to go to Mexico and India next," she said. Meanwhile, Diana Assad, 15, has silver status. "But," she added, "People are wowed when you have the gold. That and Samoa cookies."
