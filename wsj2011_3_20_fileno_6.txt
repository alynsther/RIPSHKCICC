DETROITâ€”General Motors Co. has halted all nonessential spending and travel while it gets a better handle on the potential impact of Japan's crisis on the company, the auto maker said Saturday.

GM Chairman and Chief Executive  Dan Akerson sent a companywide notice asking to hold off on any expenses that aren't critical, a company spokesman said. The note went out this week over GM's employee website. 

"We're just assessing the situation day by day," the spokesman said.

Mr. Akerson has said the potential toll of fallout from the tsunami, earthquake and nuclear crisis in Japan remains unknown. He has been working in recent days to prepare for the worst, including a move to shut down a GM factory in Louisiana that builds slow-selling small trucks. In shutting the plant, Mr. Akerson said, GM is working to ensure adequate supplies at all U.S. plants.

GM has been the most vocal of Detroit's auto makers in voicing concerns about the magnitude of potential supply chain troubles in the wake of Japan's disaster. 

On Friday, the auto maker said it would stop work at two European factories and is weighing production cuts in South Korea amid growing uncertainty over how its plants around the world will be affected by the crisis in Japan.

A shortage of Japanese-built electronic parts will force GM to close a plant in Zaragoza, Spain, on Monday and cancel shifts at a factory in Eisenach, Germany, on Monday and Tuesday, the company said. Both factories build the Corsa small car. Meantime, the company's South Korean unit said it is considering cutting production to deal with a potential shortage.
