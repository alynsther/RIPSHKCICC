ABIDJANâ€” Laurent Gbagbo's government in Ivory Coast has seized the Ivorian offices and staff of the Central Bank of West African states, also known as BCEAO, it said late Tuesday. 

"The national leadership and the officials of the BCEAO throughout the country and Ivorian personnel working for the BCEAO are requisitioned from Jan. 25 to ensure normal operations continue," the statement from Mr. Gbagbo's camp said. 

Mr. Gbagbo's move comes after the internationally recognized president-elect,  Alassane Ouattara, took control of the BCEAO Saturday, when West African heads of state forced the pro-Gbagbo bank governor to resign. 

The parallel administration of Mr. Ouattara said Mr. Gbagbo's seizure of central-bank assets was "illegal and illegitimate" and called on the bank to close its operations until further notice. 

Mr. Ouattara's administration is trying to cut off Mr. Gbagbo's sources of funding and at the weekend called for a month-long ban on cocoa and coffee exports. However, Mr. Ouattara is under blockade at a hotel in Abidjan, while the police and army in the south of the country have remained loyal to the incumbent Mr. Gbagbo. 

The international community recognizes Mr. Outtara as the winner of Ivory Coast's Nov. 28 presidential election, but Mr. Gbagbo has refused to cede power. 

A heavy presence of gendarmes around the BCEAO offices in Abidjan, including armored vehicles, was seen Wednesday. 

Ivory Coast is the world's largest cocoa producer and cocoa exports are the biggest source of government revenue. Both main ports, Abidjan and San Pedro, have been put on a European Union sanctions list and commerce has declined sharply, according to port officials.
