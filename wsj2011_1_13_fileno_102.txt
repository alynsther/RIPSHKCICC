In a San Francisco neighborhood that has a restaurant scene known for heaps of spaghetti, North Beach's Naked Lunch has gained a midday following with menu items like a sandwich with foie gras and duck prosciutto ($16) and roasted baby Chioggia beet salad ($6).

"We're fine-dining guys," said co-owner  Ryan Maxey. The eatery's name nods to the neighborhood's Beat heritage as well as the restaurant's stripped-down concept.

Naked Lunch occupies a corner of Enrico's Restaurant, which is closed during the day. Mr. Maxey and his partner  Ian Begg opened the lunch operation in 2009 after working together at the now-closed Café Majestic in Pacific Heights in 2007 and 2008. 

Diners order at the counter from a short menu that changes daily, and eat their lunch beneath heat lamps on Enrico's covered patio. Mr. Maxey said the menu, which changes daily, turns off some tourists. "Tourists come in and say 'is that all you've got,' " he said. 

Mr. Maxey said many of the 80 to 120 people he serves each day are regulars who walk over from law firms, marketing companies and other businesses in the Financial District. 

On a recent Thursday, Aaron Renfro had the fried chicken sandwich—made from thigh meat on an Acme roll—and a blood-orange cooler. A regulatory analyst with PG&E, Mr. Renfro frequently checks Naked Lunch's online menu and comes by from his South of Market office if the offerings look good. "If they're doing something where they insert fruit in a sandwich, I'm always interested in that," he said. 

Naked Lunch is located at 504 Broadway in San Francisco, in the corner entrance of Enrico's. It is open 11:30 to 2 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday.
