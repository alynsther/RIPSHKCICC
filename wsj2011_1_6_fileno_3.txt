European fairs and auctions will provide collectors with plenty of action at the start of the 2012 season. 

Brafa, Brussels's leading antiques and fine arts fair, sets the pace when it runs Jan. 21-29 and, as last year, is expected to attract more than 40,000 attendees this year. Of the 122 exhibitors, 54 are from Belgium, followed by 45 from France. The rest come from Germany, Switzerland, the U.K., Italy, Monaco, Spain, Portugal, Hungary and Canada. Although the fair is international, Brafa manager Beatrix Bourdon says organizers are keen to keep the main emphasis on Belgium's strong art market, particularly noted for works by Flemish Old Masters, tribal art and modern art.

The fair has an impressive variety of painting, sculpture, furniture and precious objects from the ancient to the 20th century. At dealer Rainer Jungbauer, two appealing terra-cotta angels in flowing robes from circa 1700 by baroque sculptor Jean del Cour will be priced at €100,000; at Adrian Schlag, a 19th-20th century Angolan ancestor mask from the Tshokwe people symbolizing the bond between the human and the spirit worlds, at €45,000; and at Guy Pieters Gallery, "Flowered Hats" (1969) by Surrealist Paul Delvaux, a lovely watercolor of languid nudes with headgear, at €350,000.

ARCOmadrid, the first of the year's major contemporary art fairs, takes place in the Spanish capital Feb. 15-19, with more than 200 international galleries exhibiting. Each year, one country is spotlighted; for 2012, the Netherlands is in the limelight with 14 Dutch galleries showing a range of the latest art including installations, video and photography by established and emerging artists.

Latin America is a major attraction at ARCO each year as galleries use the fair as a European entry point. In 2012, there will be 22 artists' solo projects chosen by six curators. Karina Peisajovich, at the Vasari gallery, will be one of four women representing Argentina, with her captivating light installations. Photographer Rochelle Costi, at Luciana Brito Gallery, will be one of four artists from Brazil, with her simple things in everyday life, such as family picnics. And from Mexico, multimedia artist Marcela Armas, at the Arróniz gallery, uses electricity, inflatables and light to illustrate themes such as immigration.

Turning to London's benchmark art auctions, Christie's will offer an Impressionist and Modern Art evening sale on Feb. 7, with paintings from the collection of late film star Elizabeth Taylor. Her top lot will be Vincent van Gogh's landscape in soft blue tones with a view of the Chapel of Saint-Rémy, from 1889, estimated at £5 million-£7 million. Another French landscape, "Apple trees at Eragny," (1894) by Camille Pissarro is expected to fetch £900,000-£1.2 million. A rare self-portrait of Edgar Degas from 1857-58 is valued at £350,000-£450,000. Among other pieces from Elizabeth Taylor will be works by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Georges Rouault, Kees Van Dongen, Maurice de Vlaminck and Augustus John.

In 2012, Christie's will include in a number of auctions 87 works from the collection of German entrepreneur and philanthropist Hubertus Wald, ranging from antiquities to modern and contemporary art. The first pieces will be offered Feb. 7-8 in sales of Impressionist, modern and Surrealist art. A major work will be "Eiffel Tower" (1926), a strikingly colorful painting of the famous French monument by Robert Delaunay. The tower was one of the artist's favorite subjects, and it is expected to fetch £1.5 million-£2.5 million. Another modern Wald highlight will be "Head of a Woman" (1913), a nude bust of a pensive woman by Kees van Dongen, estimated at £700,000-£1 million.

A star at Sotheby's auction of Impressionist and modern art Feb. 8 promises to be Gustav Klimt's painting "Lakeshore with Birches" from 1901 (estimate: £6 million-£8 million).
