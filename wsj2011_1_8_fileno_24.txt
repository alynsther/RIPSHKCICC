The good feelings left from the Nets' victory over the Bulls Wednesday quickly evaporated Friday night in Washington as the Wizards jumped out to a 30-13 edge after the first quarter and never looked back. The Nets shot just 23% in the period, and their aim didn't get much better later. 

They are now 10-26 on the season, and have won just three of 20 away games. The Wizards looked like champions, yet are just 9-25.

Brook Lopez and Jordan Farmar each scored 14 for the Nets. For the home team, Rashard Lewis and Nick Young each had 16 points.
