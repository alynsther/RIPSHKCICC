Mats Zuccarello picked a good time to score his first NHL goal, notching it with 1:51 remaining in overtime as the Rangers beat the Hurricanes on Wednesday night at the Garden. Rangers defenseman Matt Gilroy's wrist shot 8:41 into the third was the first goal of the game and looked like the game winner until Hurricanes star Eric Staal scored with 6:14 remaining to tie the game. Rangers goalie Henrik Lundqvist stopped 31 shots while Carolina's Cam Ward stopped 33.
