The Garden crowd roared in the final few minutes of Monday's win, as if they had just toppled the NBA's best. In reality, they beat a cellar-dwelling Wizards team that has now lost 21 straight road games. But the Knicks, who broke a six-game losing streak in the effort, will take anything they can get.

The Knicks beat the Wizards 115-106. Amar'e Stoudemire scored 30 points with nine rebounds while Wilson Chandler added 25 with seven rebounds.

Point guard Raymond Felton had a solid outing after shooting less than 38% in five straight games. He made seven of his 14 shots for 17 points with 15 assists.

"The fourth quarter we played good, we played hard and I think as a team that's what it's all about, seeing if we have that energy and focus," Knicks coach Mike D'Antoni said. "If we can do that on a consistent basis, we'll be pretty good."

Breaking the losing streak on Monday was particularly important because the Knicks' upcoming schedule had the potential to lengthen the streak even further. LeBron James and the Miami Heat visit the Garden on Thursday, and on Friday the Knicks hit the road to face the Atlanta Hawks.

The Knicks led by 13 in the second quarter until Mustafa Shakur—who after a promotion from the D-League is on a 10-day contract—put up six points, four assists and three rebounds in 10 minutes to key a Wizards rally. The teams were tied at 62 at halftime.

The Wizards led late in the third quarter until Mr. Stoudemire took over the game with a series of dunks that contributed to his 15 third-quarter points.

The game was still in doubt in the fourth when, with 5:41 left in the game, Danilo Gallinari drew a charge off of Al Thornton with the score 103-97. From there, the Knicks went on a 7-2 run to put the game away. A 3-pointer by Wilson Chandler with 1:45 remaining in the fourth made it 113-102 and eliminated all doubt about the game's outcome—the Wizards would remain winless on the road this season.
