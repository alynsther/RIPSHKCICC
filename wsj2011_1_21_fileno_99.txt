The chatter this week has been that the Steelers' brutally physical win over the Ravens last week was so taxing, their bodies could be spent by the time the Jets roll into town on Sunday. "Wait, I thought that was the Jets," Steelers receiver Hines Ward (pictured above) said of the "spent" label. "I thought they played the Patriots like it was their last game." Mr. Ward's tongue was firmly planted in his cheek, of course, and he more seriously said any chatter about tiredness is tone deaf. "We're one game away from the Super Bowl," he said. "You don't get tired."

The Yankees have signed onetime defensive whiz Andruw Jones to a one-year $2 million deal to be a backup outfielder and a right-handed bat off the bench, according to team sources. 

Agent Scott Boras said Wednesday that it has taken two full years for Mr. Jones to work his way back to health after 2008 knee surgery.

With Marcus Thames departing, the Yankees needed an outfielder who can hit left-handed pitching. The deal includes performance incentives that could raise its value to $3.2 million.

Jets coach Rex Ryan not only gave Brian Schottenheimer, his offensive coordinator, an unequivocal vote of confidence on Thursday. Mr. Ryan also expressed how "shocked" he was that Mr. Schottenheimer (pictured below) wasn't considered for any of the league's head-coaching vacancies. Mr. Ryan said about "5%" of him was sad. 

"The other 95% of me was happy as heck because I get him another year," Mr. Ryan said. Last season, Mr. Schottenheimer declined an opportunity to interview for the Buffalo Bills' head-coaching vacancy.
