New Delhi--Bharti Airtel Ltd has no immediate plan to list its telecom tower infrastructure unit, Bharti Infratel Ltd, and joint venture firm Indus Towers, a senior executive at the mobile-phone operator's holding company said Thursday. 

"We are not looking at an [initial public offering] at this point of time,"  Akhil Gupta, deputy group chief executive and managing director of Bharti Enterprises, told reporters on the sidelines of an industry event. 

Indus Towers, India's largest telecom tower company with more than 100,000 towers, is Bharti's joint venture with telecom operators Idea Cellular Ltd and Vodafone Essar Ltd--the Indian unit of U.K.'s Vodafone Group PLC. 

Gupta, who's also a director at Bharti Airtel, said the company will announce its plan to roll out broadband wireless services in the country in a few months' time. Bharti holds broadband licenses in four of India's 22 telecom service areas.
