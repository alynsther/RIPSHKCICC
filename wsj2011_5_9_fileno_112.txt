 Hitting the Trails Almost six million Americans age 55-plus go hiking each year, making it one of the most popular sports activities among older athletes. Among the biggest benefits: aerobic exercise. According to the Mayo Clinic, hiking, even on an easy trail, burns more calories than walking or aerobic dancing; backpacking and more strenuous outings can use up as many calories as cross-country skiing. On June 4, the American Hiking Society's National Trails Day will celebrate the 200,000-plus miles of outdoor trails in the U.S. About 2,000 events are planned across the country, including outdoor activities, clinics, exhibits and trail work projects. A map on the society's website highlights activities in each state. Happy trails.
