Phil Jackson and Kobe Bryant have won five NBA titles together. They've beaten Boston's Big 3, drubbed Tim Duncan's Spurs and made Orlando look decidedly unmagical. Now if only they could figure out their opponent Friday—the lowly Charlotte Bobcats.

The Bobcats have managed to win eight of their last 10 games against the Lakers, including a 20-point beat down in February. Since the 2005-06 season, when this current stretch began, Charlotte has compiled a paltry .417 overall winning percentage, compared to .655 for Los Angeles. During that time span, only one other team in the four major American pro sports with a winning percentage below .450 has a winning record against an opponent with a winning percentage over .650: the NFL's Miami Dolphins (.427) are 2-1 against the San Diego Chargers (.667).

Finding other instances of bad teams owning good ones is nearly impossible. The Trail Blazers, a team with a .493 winning percentage since 2005, are the next-best example in the NBA, having gone 10-10 against L.A. In the NHL, the Islanders (.468 points percentage) are 4-0-1 against the Red Wings (.687). Outside of interleague play, no baseball team with a winning percentage below .450 since 2005 has a winning record against an opponent with a winning percentage above .550. The Pirates come closest with their 16-21 mark against the Phillies.

The Bobcats aren't just squeaking by, either. Charlotte has won by their eight games over Los angeles by an average of about 11 points. The three Los Angeles victories have been by an average of just four points.
