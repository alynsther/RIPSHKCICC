Marian Gaborik had four goals and an assist three days after being benched and the Rangers scored early and often in a victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs on Wednesday night in New York.

Mr. Gaborik broke out of an eight-game goal drought with two in the first period and two more in the second. Henrik Lundqvist faced only 22 shots to earn his seventh shutout of the season.
