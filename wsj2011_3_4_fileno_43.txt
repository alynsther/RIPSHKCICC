Jeremy Hazell scored a season-high 31 points and Seton Hall, the worst 3-point shooting team in the Big East, made a season-best 12 from beyond the arc in a victory over No. 15 St. John's on Thursday night, snapping the Red Storm's six-game winning streak.

Dwight Hardy scored 23 points for St. John's (19-10, 11-6), which was one of the hottest teams in the country, having won eight of nine. But the Red Storm fell apart late and was outscored 14-2 over the last 4 minutes.
