NEW DELHI â€“ Hindalco Industries Ltd., one of India's largest metals producers, Monday posted a 6.6% rise in its fourth-quarter unconsolidated net profit, driven by higher prices of copper and aluminum. 

Unconsolidated net profit rose to 7.08 billion rupees ($158.3 million) from 6.64 billion rupees, while sales grew 26% to 67.61 billion rupees from 53.58 billion rupees.

The company's net profit growth was limited by a sharp rise in raw material costs, which jumped 53% to 47.94 billion rupees.

The earnings beat market expectations. The average of estimates in a poll of four analysts was for unconsolidated net profit of 6.26 billion rupees.

Hindalco's unconsolidated results didn't include the financial performance of its North American subsidiary, Novelis Inc. 

Indian companies sell copper and aluminum at the same level as London Metals Exchange prices. LME base metal prices have risen over the past 12 months due to robust economic growth in emerging countries such as India, China and Brazil. The rapid pace of urbanization and industrialization in these countries has resulted in huge demand for commodities. 

Demand in developed economies such as the U.S and European Union is recovering as well, albeit at a slower pace. 

Revenue from Hindalco's copper business, its largest division, rose 38% to 46.37 billion rupees from 33.61 billion rupees, while output of copper cathodes rose to 84,961 metric tons from 74,734 tons a year earlier. 

Revenue from the aluminum business climbed to 22.11 billion rupees from 20.11 billion rupees, while aluminum output rose slightly to 138,720 tons from 138,023 tons. 

The company said spiraling prices of input materials, especially fuel, continue to pose a serious challenge. 

Hindalco said it spent 65 billion rupees on its various new projects in the financial year which ended on March 31.
