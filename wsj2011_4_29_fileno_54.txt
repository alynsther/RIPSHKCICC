The organization Good Shepherd Services, which helps at-risk youth and families, had successfully flown under the radar—for 154 years!—until longtime supporter Isaac Mizrahi hijacked its fund-raising efforts to enlist the help of some of his celebrity friends.

 The designer threw the charity's first ever red-carpet bash Wednesday, with such high-profile guests as Mariska Hargitay and Coco Rocha.

Mr. Mizrahi said he created Good Shepherd's inaugural spring party, which raised $700,000 at Highline Stages, after attending the organization's subdued fall benefit. "I've been going to that party for seven years thinking, I don't really know anybody here, what's going on?," he said. "I thought it would be great to do something a little more ebullient."

For one, the stars ambling down the red carpet were a new addition.

"This is the first she ever heard of the word 'step and repeat' in her entire life," said Mr. Mizrahi, indicating the nun standing next to him, Good Shepherd's executive director Sister Paulette LoMonaco. But Mr. Mizrahi closely controlled the event's details, holding meetings to choose the tablecloths and chairs, which all ended up pink.
