Baseball's Hall-of-Fame election results brought to a close one very long journey for Bert Blyleven. With more career strikeouts than every Hall-of-Fame pitcher besides Nolan Ryan and Steve Carlton and boosted by a strong campaign from sabermetric-style writers, Mr. Blyleven (pictured) was selected in his 14th year on the ballot. Joining Mr. Blyleven in Cooperstown will be Roberto Alomar, who was admitted in his second year of eligibility and who became just the 27th player to get the support of 90% of the voters. The induction ceremony is held July 24.

College football's most controversial father and son seem to be moving past the pay-for-play scandal. Auburn quarterback and Heisman Trophy winner Cam Newton said his father—whom the NCAA found to have tried to sell his son's services during his recruitment —will attend the national-title game. The younger Mr. Newton said his family will be "loud and proud" at the game and that he considers the saga a blessing. "The whole process made me stronger, and it opened my eyes to who's in this for me," he said.
