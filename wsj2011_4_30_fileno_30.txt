The lockout is back on.

A three judge panel of the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals voted 2-1 Friday to issue a temporary stay of the district court injunction that lifted the lockout earlier in the week. . 

The judges will rule in the coming days on a request by the NFL to issue a full stay of the injunction until they reach a decision on the owners appeal of the district court ruling. 

U.S. district court Judge Susan Richard Nelson issued the injunction because she said the lockout violated anti-trust laws.
