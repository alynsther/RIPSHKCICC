MUMBAI â€“ Air India Ltd. has cancelled about 88% of its flights Monday, as pilots accusing the airline of unfair wage practices continue to strike for a sixth day, said a spokesman at the national carrier. 

"We will operate only 40 of the total 320 flights...all flights cancelled are domestic, our international operations continue as per schedule," said a company spokesman.

He didn't provide figures on the total revenue the carrier has lost because of the strike. Air India said Friday that it lost 265 million rupees ($6 million) for the first three days of the strike. 

The ongoing strike was called by former Indian Airlines pilots, part of a union called the Indian Commercial Pilots Association, as they accused the airline of not paying them wages in line with their counterparts at Air India. 

The federal government merged Air India with Indian Airlines in 2007, but the company has as yet been unable to bring all staff from the two companies under a common wage structure. 

Air India employs 1,500 pilots in a total workforce of above 31,000 people. 

The airline has said that the strike is illegal due to an earlier assurance by the union to the Delhi High Court that it wouldn't strike. 

The airline is now waiting for a decision from the court, which will take up "Contempt of Court" proceedings against members of the union on Friday, the spokesman said.
