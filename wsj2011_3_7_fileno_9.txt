, the country's largest property developer by market share, said net profit surged 37% in 2010 on higher sales and property prices. 

The Shenzhen company said net profit rose to 7.28 billion yuan ($1.1 billion) from 5.33 billion yuan a year earlier. Revenue rose 3.8% to 50.71 billion yuan from 48.88 billion yuan. Vanke said gross margins rose 7.76 percentage points to 29.75% as efforts to control costs bore fruit. 

Vanke recommended a final dividend of one yuan for every 10 existing shares, up from 0.7 yuan for 2009. 

The company said in January that revenue from property sales in 2010 rose 71% from a year earlier to 108.16 billion yuan. In terms of floor area, China Vanke's 2010 property sales rose 35% to 8.98 million square meters. 

Vanke said the local supply of residential property will be sharply higher this year, predicting that this, together with the government's efforts to curb speculative property demand, will shift the market in favor of home buyers. 

The State Council, or cabinet, introduced tightening measures for the property market in late January, including more limits on home buying and another increase in down payments for second-home purchases, highlighting authorities' desire to rein in property prices.China plans to build 36 million government-subsidized apartments from now through 2015, including 10 million this year, so more will be available for low-income residents, Premier Wen Jiabao said Saturday.
