WASHINGTONâ€”President Barack Obama Thursday nominated the first woman to lead the Justice Department's national-security prosecutions.

Lisa Monaco, 43 years old, was a prosecutor on the Justice Department team that investigated the collapse of energy company Enron.

If confirmed by the Senate, Ms. Monaco would succeed David Kris as assistant attorney general for national security. The national-security division investigates and prosecutes counterterrorism, foreign espionage and other security cases. 

Mr. Kris has left the division to become general counsel for Intellectual Ventures LLC, a Justice Department official said. The Bellevue, Wash., firm is led by former Microsoft Corp. executive Nathan Myhrvold and owns a large portfolio of technology patents.

Justice Department officials say the past two years have been the most active period for counterterrorism threats since the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. In addition to a spate of domestic terror prosecutions, national-security prosecutors have investigated attempted attacks from al Qaeda affiliates in Yemen, Somalia and Pakistan.

Ms. Monaco is currently a top adviser to the deputy attorney general and formerly was chief of staff to Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Robert Mueller.
