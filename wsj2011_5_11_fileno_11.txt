WASHINGTONâ€”The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission told the operators of nuclear plants Wednesday to provide information about their plans to respond to "extreme events," saying it would use the information as it reviews its safety regime after a nuclear crisis in Japan. 

The agency is conducting a wide-reaching review of its safety regulations following the release of radiation at Japan's Fukushima Daiichi plant and is scheduled to get its first briefing on that review Thursday. 

The agency Wednesday asked for detailed information about plans that companies were required to develop after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The plans deal with the possibility that large areas of the plant would be lost during an emergency and detail how the operator would continue to keep nuclear reactors cool and prevent the release of radiation. 

The agency said in a news release that it "continues to conclude" the plans would be effective, even as it reviews them. 

"We'll review the plants' responses to see if they need to take any additional actions to meet our existing requirements, along with seeing what the NRC might need to do to enhance those requirements and continue to protect public health and safety," said NRC Chairman Gregory Jaczko. 

Operators of the 104 reactors in the U.S. have until June 10 to show the tools to implement the plans are in place and available, and that sufficient staff are on hand to execute them. By July 11, the companies must show how the plans are tested and re-evaluated, as well as how they coordinate with local emergency responders. 

"Our initial guidance on these strategies focused on the mitigative actions themselves, but we also need to consider things such as operator training and maintaining the related equipment," said Eric Leeds, director of the NRC's Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation.
