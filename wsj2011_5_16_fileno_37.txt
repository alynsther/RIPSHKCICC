Genpact Ltd., a business process and technology management company, has announced the appointment of N.V. "Tiger" Tyagarajan as president and chief executive effective June 17.

He will replace Pramod Bhasin, who has decided to step down, according to a company statement. Mr. Bhasin will become non-executive vice chairman of the company.

This won't be Mr. Tyagarajan's first run as the company's CEO. He headed the company between 1999 and 2002. He worked at GE Capital after that until he rejoined Genpact, when it became an independent company in 2005, as executive vice president of sales and business development. Most recently, he was chief operations officer of Genpact.

This move comes in the context of Genpact's $550 million acquisition of Headstrong, an information technology and consulting company, earlier this year.
