With contract talks stalled between  Julie Taymor and producers of "Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark," the union that represents the director submitted a formal request Monday for documentation concerning the producers' demands regarding her future royalties, among other issues.

In the nearly two weeks since Ms. Taymor received a very public demotion from producers  Michael Cohl and  Jeremiah J. Harris, the parties have been in negotiations over her contract.

"We want to ensure that the producers meet their obligations to Julie with respect to compensation, credit and use of artistic property," said  Laura Penn, executive director of the Stage Directors and Choreographers Society. "It hasn't been resolved...and there comes a time when it's time for your union to step in," Ms. Penn said.

A spokeswoman for Ms. Taymor,  Mara Buxbaum, said in a statement that the director is not "demanding a financial payout, nor has she threatened to prevent changes to the production in any way at this time, while the discussions are ongoing."

A spokesman for the production,  Rick Miramontez, declined to comment. 

Messrs. Cohl and Harris effectively wrested the $70 million musical from the Tony Award-winning Ms. Taymor earlier this month when they hired "The Boy From Oz" director  Philip William McKinley to oversee staging in a planned overhaul of the production. 

But Ms. Taymor's contract guarantees broad creative control, and she must agree to waive those rights in order for producers to proceed with changes to the show.

While she is set to remain a co-writer, however, producers can add additional co-writers, according to a person familiar with the matter. They have already hired Spider-Man comic writer  Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa to revise the book.
