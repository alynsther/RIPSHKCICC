Alex Rodriguez has gotten off to a ferocious start in spring training, and today a famous face saw him hit his first Florida home run—actress girlfriend Cameron Diaz, sitting in the front row as the Yankees played the Astros in Kissimmee.

Rodriguez is 6 for 13 with a home run and four doubles so far this spring, and he said that being two years removed from hip surgery made all the difference. "I think my work overall has been more consistent—I feel stronger and more flexible," Rodriguez said. "Throw stats out the window in spring training, but overall I feel pretty good."

The Mets might want to schedule more exhibition games against the Red Sox next year. They drew an announced crowd of 7,413 fans for Sunday's game at Digital Domain Park, the largest crowd ever for a spring training game in Port St. Lucie, Fla. Many fans were clad in Red Sox gear. The Mets averaged just 4,983 fans per game during spring training in 2010, which ranked just 23rd in the majors, according to Stats Inc.
