MUMBAI --Kavveri Telecom Products is in talks with a couple of private-equity investors to raise between 400 million rupees ($8.94 million) to 500 million rupees ($11.2 million) by selling a stake in its infrastructure unit. 

"The sale would be through an issue of fresh shares," said Managing Director Shivakumar Reddy. 

The Indian telecom products maker owns 51% of unit Kavveri Telecom Infrastructure, while the rest is held by the founding family.

Kavveri Telecom Products is also in talks with a handful companies for orders potentially worth between $3 million to $20 million, he said. These orders are likely to be executed over the next 18 to 24 months.

The company, one of the few Indian telecom product makers, has a factory in the southern Indian city of Bangalore and says it is benefiting from a global drive to reduce the world's manufacturing dependence on China. 

In May, Kavveri said it had received a contract manufacturing order from a European client worth 750 million rupees. The company didn't elaborate on the period of that contract. 

Kavveri mostly makes antennas and other related products embedded in modems and communication devices sold by telecom firms to consumers. The company's products are used by Chinese makers of telecommunication equipment such as Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp., Mr. Reddy of Kavveri said. 

The company has received orders from two U.S. telecom firms for the manufacture of its recently launched radio antenna--used for fourth-generation-based telecom services, he added. The company has received orders to supply up to 40,000 such antennas every year for the next four to five years at a price of $200 each. 

This growth in orders is likely to lead to a 30% rise in revenues from a year earlier for the fiscal year which began April 1, Mr. Reddy said. Operating margins are likely to improve due to better business volumes and improved profitability at the infrastructure unit, he said, without elaborating.
