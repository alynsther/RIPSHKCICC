HONG KONGâ€”Hong Kong's legislature approved the government's revised interim funding proposal Wednesday, a week after blocking an earlier version of the proposal for the first time due to the discontent over Financial Secretary John Tsang's budget for the next fiscal year. 

The government had to submit the revised interim funding proposal, which was cut to 59.7 billion Hong Kong dollars (US$7.66 billion) from HK$60.2 billion, to the legislature for discussion after failing to receive support for the earlier version from half the lawmakers present at a meeting on March 9. 

Interim funding mainly covers the government's expenditures during the period between the end of the fiscal year, which ends March 31, and final approval of the budget for the next fiscal year by the legislature. 

Some lawmakers said they blocked the earlier version of the interim funding proposal partly because they were dissatisfied with Mr. Tsang's budget proposal. Pro-government lawmakers were attending the National People's Congress in Beijing at the time and couldn't attend the meeting. 

On March 3, Mr. Tsang announced cash handouts for some of the territory's permanent residents and personal-income-tax waivers for individuals in a bid to diffuse widespread public discontent over his budget address on Feb 23. However, some lawmakers said Mr. Tsang had failed to provide enough details for the plan and respond to their demands for more long-term measures to narrow the wealth gap in the city.
