NEW DELHI â€“ An Indian court Thursday extended the judicial custody of former Telecommunications Minister Andimuthu Raja, two of his former aides and a corporate executive in a case relating to irregularities in allotting telecom licenses and bandwidth in 2008. 

  O.P. Saini, special judge, special court of the Central Bureau of Investigation, extended Mr. Raja's custody by 14 days until March 17. 

The court also extended the judicial custody of former Telecom Secretary Siddartha Behura, Raja's former personal secretary R.K. Chandolia, as well as  Shahid Balwa, vice chairman of Etisalat DB Telecom Pvt. for a similar period. 

The CBI has been scrutinizing the government's 2008 sale of mobile phone licenses and bandwidth at 2001 prices, and had arrested the four people last month. All four have denied any wrongdoing. 

The agency estimates the government lost more than $4.88 billion of potential revenue due to the irregularities. A report by a federal auditor estimates the potential losses at close to $40 billion. 

The agency has named Swan Telecom Pvt., which was later renamed Etisalat DB, among the beneficiaries of the allegedly rigged license sale. Balwa is a co-founder of Swan, and also of real-estate company DB Realty Ltd.
