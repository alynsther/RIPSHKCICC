Curtis McElhinney faced 34 shots and stopped 33 of them, backstopping the Ottawa Senators to a win over the Devils on Thursday night.

The Sens' Chris Neil—usually known for using his hands for fighting rather than scoring—notched a pair of goals in the third period.

The loss snapped a four-game winning streak for the Devils, who have been streaking of late and are creeping up on a playoff spot after starting the season as one of the worst teams in hockey. 

The Senators are the only team to have beaten the Devils this month, and now they've done it twice—they also won 2-1 on March 8.

Brian Rolston scored the lone goal for the Devils, his 13th of the season, in the third. Martin Brodeur stopped 22 of 24 shots in the loss.

McElhinney, a backup goaltender, was making only his second start for Ottawa. 

The Devils face Alex Ovechkin and the powerhouse Washington Capitals, who recently reeled off a nine-game winning streak of their own, on Friday in Newark.
