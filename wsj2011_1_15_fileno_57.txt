Most New Year's resolutions seem made to be broken. A much simpler pledge?

Resolve to track down (and really wear) the perfect red lip shade. According to Lipstick Queen cosmetics owner Poppy King, who's known for her perma-crimson pout, the essential first step is identifying the texture you feel most comfortable wearing (a gloss or tinted balm are great training wheels) and then finding the ideal hue for your coloring.

"When it comes to foundation you want it to match, but for lipstick, the idea is for it to contrast with your skin and hair color," she said. For example, a pale blonde can brighten her entire complexion by opting for a red with orange undertones. (Blonde Kate Winslet swears by Lancôme's Absolute Rouge.) A medium-skinned brunette (think Katie Holmes) should stick to a pinkish blue base; in order to detect this undertone, swipe the lipstick on your hand and look for a slightly pink hue.

And when in doubt, opt for a sheer shade such as Ms. King's own Medieval lipstick which makes up 25% of her sales. "I think it's because it's the color of blood, but sheer," said Ms. King. "Of course, we all have blood in our veins." Which proves our point: Wearing red couldn't be more natural.
