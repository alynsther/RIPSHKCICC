LONDON—Moody's Investors Service Inc. on Thursday said the U.K. budget indicates the government is tackling the current economic and fiscal challenges with plans to significantly reduce its budget deficit and levels of debt. 

The ratings company said this fiscal consolidation plan is an important factor supporting the country's triple-A rating and stable outlook. 

"Although the weaker economic growth prospects in 2011 and 2012 do not directly cast doubt on the U.K.'s sovereign rating level, we believe that slower growth combined with weaker-than-expected fiscal consolidation could cause the U.K.'s debt metrics to deteriorate to a point that would be inconsistent with a triple-A rating," Moody's said. 

Moody's noted the economic environment is "a particular challenge at the moment," pointing to slower growth in the fourth quarter and the downward revision of the forecast for 2011 by the Office for Budget Responsibility. 

In his second budget since the coalition government took office in May, Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne told Parliament that the independent OBR revised up its forecasts for public sector net borrowing by around £10 billion ($16.38 billion) a year. 

Public-sector borrowing is projected to hit £122 billion in the 2011-12 financial year, compared with £117 billion previously forecast. However, despite the increase in public sector borrowing, the OBR said the government will meet its fiscal target of eliminating the structural budget deficit by 2015-16. 

"The U.K. has the willingness to meet these challenges," Moody's said, adding this conclusion is based on plans to achieve a cyclically adjusted current balance by the 2015-2016 fiscal year, or even earlier, despite the recent deterioration in the near-term economic growth outlook.
