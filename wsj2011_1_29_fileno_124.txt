Thanks to numerous (and adorable) spring runway moments, the fashion backward barrette has become the unexpected toast of the beauty season. The look popped up at Prabal Gurung (glossed-over pony tails were clipped mid-mane); Cynthia Rowley (big metallic versions made modern chignons) and Carolina Herrera, where tress guru Orlando Pita created fanciful clips out of human hair. 

Most inspiring, however, were barrettes that nonchalantly pinned back a wind-swept side part at Rodarte, where hand-crafted bobbys debuted as part of the Mulleavy sisters' much lauded collection inspired in part by Santa Cruz. Aveda lead stylist and legendary backstage beauty genius Odile Gilbert created the distinctive hairdos, and said she aimed to channel the blond, healthy locks associated with the archetypal West Coast girl "while still being chic," rather than say, crunchy camping at Big Sur. While Ms. Gilbert conceded that the effect creates "an innocent look, almost like a little girl's hair," she also pointed out that "a barrette like those made by Rodarte is more like jewelry, a piece of art that you can wear—it's more sophisticated," which is all the encouragement we grown women need to attempt this at home. (Think Marcia Brady meets Brigitte Bardot.) 

If you're similarly inspired, find a gorgeous clasp and a few of Ms. Gilbert's secret weapons: Backstage she blow-dried hair straight, and used her fingers to create the not-too-severe side parts. She then spritzed the models' hair with volumizer and tousled it with a daily hair repair serum for added texture. For the final touch, she attached the thick clips to the left, just above the ear, and sealed the deal with a good dose of hairspray. No matter the technique, a barrette leaves a light-hearted, youthful impression. What other hair accessory—or surgical process for that matter—can say the same?
