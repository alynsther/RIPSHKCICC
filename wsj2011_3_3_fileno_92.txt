On the same day that Jets met with former Indianapolis Colts safety Bob Sanders, they said goodbye to defensive end Vernon Gholston, releasing him and tight end Ben Hartsock on Wednesday. Selected by the Jets in the first round in the 2008 draft, Ghoston did not register a sack in 45 games with the team. His departure came one day after the team released defensive tackle Kris Jenkins, linebacker Jason Taylor and offensive tackle Damien Woody.

Sanders (pictured above) is a two-time Pro Bowl safety who was recently released by the Colts. He signed a five-year contract worth a reported $37.5 million with the Colts in 2007, but because of injuries has played only nine regular-season games since, including just one last season.

Yankee first baseman Mark Teixeira has parted ways with leading baseball agent Scott Boras, who negotiated the monster eight-year, $180-million contract that landed Teixeira in New York. 

Teixeira said he's not thinking about his next contract right now, he's thinking about expanding his place in the community and working on his charitable endeavors.

He said he has not chosen his next agent.

With the collective bargaining agreement set to expire tonight and uncertainty looming, the Giants went ahead and signed one restricted free agent anyway: running back D.J. Ware. The 26-year-old had just 30 carries last season, but he led the team with a 20.6-yard average on kick returns.

 Ware said the first year of the two-year deal carries a base of $640,000 and incentives that can raise the total to $1.1 million.
