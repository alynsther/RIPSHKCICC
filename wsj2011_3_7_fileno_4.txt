Small-cap funds have increasingly been investing in companies larger than their category name would indicateâ€”and the average fund is underperforming its benchmark, research from  Credit Suisse shows.

The average market capitalization of a company in a small-cap fund was about $3.1 billion at the end of 2010, compared to the average market cap of the benchmark Russell 2000 index of about $1.3 billion. The $1.8 billion gap between the two is the largest since September 2008. 

In 2010, the average small-cap fund lagged the Russell benchmark. The average small-cap fund gained 24.3%, compared with 25.3% for the Russell 2000. The trend looks poised to continue in 2011. In February, just 27% of Russell 2000 core funds beat the benchmark.

"Small-cap managers can't keep up," says  Lori Calvasina, small- and midcap U.S.-equity strategist at Credit Suisse. "And it's because of the market cap."

About half of the Russell 2000 is made up of companies with market caps of $500 million and lower. Because of their size, they trade less frequently than larger stocks and tend to cost more to trade. Most aren't covered by Wall Street, making it difficult for managers to discriminate between them.

Unfortunately for managers, smaller stocks rise the most when stocks are in rally mode. "When the Russell goes up, most managers underperform," says Ms. Calvasina.

If the market turns, or small caps begin to lag large caps, active managers should outperform. "Small-cap managers have built portfolios to weather pullbacks but not to lead on rallies," says Ms. Calvasina. 

The results were similar for small-cap growth funds. The difference in average market cap between the Russell 2000 Growth Index and small-cap growth funds was $502 million, the smallest since March 2009. The Russell 2000 Growth gained 28.3% in 2010, while growth funds gained 27.2%.

The one group of small-cap-fund managers who beat their benchmark were small-cap value managers. They beat the Russell 2000 Value Index by 3.1 percentage points in 2010. The reason, Ms. Calvasina speculates, is that value managers are less inclined to have quality high on their list of priorities. 

"Small-cap-value guys are deep contrarians," says Ms. Calvasina. "They like the stuff everybody hates."
