Asian stock indexes ended generally lower Wednesday, with falling commodity prices dragging down resource shares.

Australian stocks had a third straight losing session, weighed down by concerns over the financial impact of devastating floods. The S&P/ASX 200 fell 0.6% to 4714.93. 

Japan's Nikkei Stock Average fell 0.2% to 10380.77, though the broader Topix index was flat. The Kospi shed 0.1% to 2082.55 in Seoul to snap a five-session win streak. China's Shanghai Composite fell 0.5% to 2839.22 to snap a four-session win streak. Taiwan's Taiex shed 1.7% to 8846.31. 

Hong Kong was among the few winners, with the Hang Seng Index adding 0.4% to 23757.82 for its sixth straight rise.

"It's really a profit-taking after a sharp rise over the last couple of weeks, but underlying strength is still there," said  Yoji Takeda, director of RBC Investment Management Asia Ltd. in Hong Kong.

 down 0.9% and  Fortescue Metals Group down 0.8%. Insurers recovered some ground after recent declines.  Insurance Australia Group climbed 1.6%, and  QBE Insurance Group rose 0.5%.

  Nick Paltoglou, senior client adviser at Ord Minnett, said weaker prices for "hard" commodities such as gold, copper and oil, and concerns about how China will deal with inflation, also dragged on the market. But rising interest in global food demand helped companies with exposure to "soft" commodities.

 which dropped sharply late last year on worries over rain-delayed harvests, rose 3.9% a day after saying that grain received into its network rose more than 50% from Dec. 20 to 10.7 million metric tons. A metric ton equals 2,204.62 pounds.

In Japan, smartphone-related stocks dominated otherwise lackluster market action.  Sharp rose 3% following a Nikkei report that idled LCD production lines at two factories had resumed operations.  Renesas Electronics added 11% after Nikkei reports that the company has developed a chip that will allow 16-megapixel images on smartphone cameras for the first time.

  Yahoo Japan shed 4.7% as Goldman Sachs resumed coverage with a "sell" rating, saying smartphones and social-media websites such as Facebook could put pressure on the company by diverting traffic away from portal sites.

In South Korea, the main index briefly rose to a record before easing on profit-taking in technology and financial stocks that had risen sharply in recent sessions. Samsung Electronics fell 1.7%, and KB Financial Group fell 2.3%. Hyundai Engineering & Construction rose 6.7% following a court ruling late Tuesday allowing its creditors to start talking with Hyundai Motor Group about selling a stake in the builder.

Analysts said that despite sharp advances since December, they see room for the market to rise further thanks to ample liquidity in the global financial system and hopes that the global economic recovery is gaining momentum.

"Considering valuations and the steady foreign buying, the main index is likely to rise to touch the 2100 level soon," said  Lee Jae-hoon, an analyst at Mirae Asset Securities. "I think there is enough energy to lift the market."

In China, property developers fell amid concerns about monetary tightening, analysts said.  Shanghai Industrial Development fell 1.2%, and  Beijing Urban Construction Investment & Development shed 1.1%. On Tuesday, they rose 3.1% and 8.4%, respectively.

In Hong Kong, local property firms helped drive gains, with  Sun Hung Kai Properties up 1.9% and  Cheung Kong up 1.1%. Citigroup said it expects office rentals in the territory to rise 15% to 20% in 2011 and continue rising in 2012, thanks to a low level of new supply and continued recovery in the Hong Kong economy.

"We believe share prices of landlords have already priced in our estimated 2011 growth so further upside needs to be justified by a more bullish view on commercial properties post-2011," Citigroup analyst  Ken Yeung said.

  HSBC Holdings rose 2.4% in Hong Kong.

New Zealand stocks rose 0.5% to 3324.99 on the first trading day of the year.

"We are playing a bit of catch-up," said Hamilton Hindin Greene broker  Grant Williamson, noting that Tuesday was a good day for most Asian markets.

In other regional action, India's Sensex fell 1% to 20301.10, Indonesian stocks added 0.6% and Malaysia's KLCI rose 0.9%.
