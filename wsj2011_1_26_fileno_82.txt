Seven-foot players or taller, age 25 or younger, with the lowest rate of total rebounds per 36 minutes.*

The age-old basketball mantra is, "You can't teach size." But given that the Nets' seven-foot center Brooks Lopez is on pace to have one of the worst rebounding seasons ever for a big man, they are left to wonder, "Can you teach size to rebound?"

The 22-year-old Mr. Lopez is having the eighth-worst season in NBA history in rebounds per 36 minutes played among players at least seven feet tall, age 25 or younger. In fact, his rate of 6.2 trails a few guards who are significantly shorter. Oklahoma City's Thabo Sefolosha (6-foot-7) and the Heat's Dwyane Wade (6-foot-4) both have hit the glass harder this season.

The hope is that Mr. Lopez will learn the subtle arts of positioning and timing to improve his rebounding rate to a level more fitting for a seven-footer. But if he does, he'll be the exception to the rule. 

Young seven-foot-plus players who have struggled with rebounding like Mr. Lopez has, generally don't make drastic improvements. Just one player of this same mold finished with a career rate more than two rebounds per 36 minutes better than that early low point—former Los Angeles Clipper Stanley Roberts.

Most concerning to the Nets is that Mr. Lopez's rebounding is getting progressively worse— from 9.6 his rookie season to 8.4 last year to now 6.2 rebounds per 36 minutes. His current rate is seventh best on his team. The fact that he leads the team in field goal attempts likely limits his offensive rebounding. But the 265-pounder is 10th on the Nets in defensive rebounds (3.7 per 36 minutes), behind Sasha Vujacic, who is not only five inches shorter but nearly 60 pounds lighter.
