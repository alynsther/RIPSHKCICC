SEOUL—South Korea's sovereign wealth fund and one of the largest pension funds in Canada will jointly invest in Brazil's Manabi Holding SA to participate in an iron-ore exploration project, a person familiar with the deal said Friday. 

Korea Investment Corp. plans to invest $100 million in Rio de Janeiro-based Manabi, a special purpose company that administers steel assets including iron-ore exploration. The investment is likely to happen next week, the person told Dow Jones Newswires. 

Canada's Ontario Teacher's Pension Plan and an asset-management firm will also participate, the person said, with the Ontario fund's contribution similar to KIC's. 

"Once Manabi sets a detailed plan for its iron ore mine exploration, it will list" on Brazil's exchange, the person said. 

Brazil's Securities and Exchange Commission website showed that Manabi Holding has filed a request for an initial register, which is usually made to prepare for an issuance of notes, debt, or prior to an initial public offering.
