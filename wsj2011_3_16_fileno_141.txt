Asian shares tumbled Tuesday as Tokyo's stock benchmark plunged 11% on panic selling amid worries that a possible nuclear catastrophe in Japan would further complicate and endanger the nation's recovery from its worst earthquake on record.

The Nikkei Stock Average finished 11% lower at 8,605.15 after sliding more than 14% earlier in the day, pressured by news of explosions at Tokyo Electric Power Co.'s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant's No. 2 and No. 4 reactors, on top of previous blasts at the Nos. 1 and 3 reactors.

Coming on top of a 6.2% fall Monday, the performance is the Nikkei's worst since its Oct. 16, 2008, drop of 11.4%, in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.

"What the world is watching right now is whether Tepco's Fukushima nuclear power plant is going to turn into Chernobyl," said Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities, referring to the world's worst nuclear disaster at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in 1986 in present-day Ukraine. 

Investor wealth of $364 billion—9.4% of the Tokyo stock exchange's market capitalization—was wiped out during the session after Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan said there is a high risk of elevated radiation levels from the nuclear reactors and urged people within 30 kilometers (about 20 miles) of the plant to stay indoors. The Tokyo metropolitan government said radiation levels in the capital surged to 23 times the normal level Tuesday.

Ranking among the major losers in Tokyo, shares of Tokyo Electric Power Co. dropped 25%, Toshiba Corp. fell 20% and Fast Retailing Co. shed 18%.

In the futures market, the Nikkei June contract fell 820 points to close at 8,640 on the Osaka Securities Exchange, where circuit breakers were triggered during the session, prompting a temporary trading halt.

The hefty losses in Tokyo also drove declines in other Asian markets, raising concerns about a wider global market fallout.



Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index tumbled 2.9%, China's Shanghai Composite lost 1.4%, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 shed 2.1%, Taiwan's Taiex skidded 3.4% and South Korea's Kospi gave up 2.4%, while India's Sensex fell 1.5%.

Dow Jones Industrial Average futures slumped 167 points in screen trade.

In commodities trading, April crude-oil prices shed $1.95 to $99.22 a barrel, while spot gold was at $1,415.10, down $13.70 a troy ounce.

"[The nuclear developments are] still unfolding as we trade the market," said Ben Collett, head of Japanese equities at Louis Capital Markets. "With a 12% down-move on the Nikkei, you've got to sell not just the Nikkei but also the S&P" and other global markets, unless there is a Japanese government-coordinated move to support markets, he said.

Other analysts said the impact on global markets was likely to be more subdued and that the fall in Tokyo stocks this week presented a buying opportunity.

"How many times in a lifetime do you see a major market drop nearly 20% in two days? Professional investors should and will look at buying opportunities at this point," said Uwe Parpart, chief economist and Asia strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald.

Figuring among the major stock movers in the region were Chinese coal and gold miners, which retreated, tracking a fall in global oil and gold prices. China Shenhua Energy Co. dropped 2.7% and Zijin Mining Group Co. lost 3.8% in Shanghai; in Hong Kong, they gave up 2% and 3.4%, respectively.

"There is panic selling in the A-share market [in Shanghai] as investors are fretting over the reactor leaks in Japan, and further downside is likely to depend on whether the leaks in Japan can be placed under control," said Tang Yonggang, an analyst from Hong Yuan Securities.

Shares of Ping An Insurance Group Co. of China sank 6.1% in Hong Kong on the insurer's plan to raise $2.5 billion from a private placement.

In Sydney, shares of uranium miners and explorers extended Monday's falls, with Energy Resources of Australia Ltd. sliding 14% and Paladin Energy Ltd. shedding 18%.

Several steel and refining stocks that had risen the previous day also retreated amid worries about the scale of Japan's nuclear problems.

Posco fell 3.5% and S-Oil Corp. dropped 0.7% in Seoul, Bluescope Steel Ltd. declined 5.8% in Sydney, Tata Steel Ltd. slid 1.1% and Indian Oil Corp. shed 1.3% in Mumbai trade.

China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. shed 2.3% in Hong Kong and 1.6% in Shanghai.

Elsewhere in the region, New Zealand's NZX 50 gave up 1.4%, Philippine shares lost 0.6%, Singapore's Straits Times Index fell 2.8%, Thailand's SET stumbled 1.9% and Indonesian shares retreated 1.3%. 

Foreign-exchange markets saw choppy trade as Prime Minister Kan's comments sparked a wave of selling in riskier currencies such as the Australian dollar. 

The U.S. dollar dropped to a low of 81.21 yen before bouncing and was last at 81.53 yen, compared with 81.62 yen in late New York trade Monday. The euro was at 113.56 yen from 114.22 yen, and at $1.3927 from $1.3993. 

The Australian dollar tumbled to 99.45 cents from its intra-day high of $1.0095. 

There was also heavy selling in the Singapore dollar, the Indian rupee, the Korean won and the New Zealand dollar.
