The U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave approval for French pharmaceutical giant  Sanofi-Aventis SA to sell its Allegra allergy treatment without a prescription, the company said Tuesday. 

The Allegra family of products will be available in the U.S. over the counter as of March, Sanofi-Aventis said. 

  Hanspeter Spek, the company's president of global operations, said converting prescription medicines to over-the-counter products was "a key growth driver for Sanofi-Aventis to become a diversified health-care company" in the U.S. 

In its most recent quarterly results, Allegra sales fell 23% as its stronger performance in Japan was more than offset by generic competition in the U.S., where sales of the franchise plunged 55%. It represented about 5% of the company's net U.S. sales. 

Allegra has been on the market for 15 years, and Sanofi had been fighting off copycat competition on the popular seasonal allergy treatment since 2001, before it settled litigation against two generic drug makers in 2008 that set up licenses to certain patent rights.

An estimated 40 million Americans have indoor/outdoor allergies, according to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America. The most common triggers are tree, grass and weed pollen; mold spores; dust mite and cockroach allergen and cat, dog and rodent dander. Allergy attacks are the human immune system's reaction to a foreign protein substance and can result in symptoms such as coughing, sneezing, itchy eyes, runny nose and scratchy throat.

Besides Allegra, Clarinex, Xyzal and Astelin are among prescription drugs used to treat allergies. Over-the-counter products currently for sale include Benadryl, Claritin and Zyrtec.
