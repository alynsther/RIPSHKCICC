MUMBAI â€“ Indian shares rose for the fourth straight session to end at a two-month high Friday as investors unwound short positions ahead of a derivatives expiry next week, while technology stocks led by  Infosys Technologies gained on a bullish demand outlook. 

The Bombay Stock Exchange's Sensitive Index climbed 464.90 points, or 2.5%, to close at 18815.64 after moving between 18480.69 and 18858.30. The Sensex, which last finished above this level on Jan. 25, gained 5.2% this week. 

On the National Stock Exchange, the 50-stock S&P CNX Nifty added 131.85 points, or 2.4%, to end at 5654.25. 

Trading volume on the BSE fell to 32.90 billion rupees ($736 million) from Thursday's 35.34 billion rupees. Gainers outnumbered decliners 1,727 to 1,199, while 114 stocks were unchanged. 

"A lot of the short positions which were built during the earthquake in Japan were unwound today ahead of the expiry of March derivatives [next] Thursday," said  Alex Mathews, head of research at Geojit BNP Paribas Financial Services. Mr. Mathews, however, said he doesn't believe that the uptrend can be sustained in coming sessions and expects the Sensex to face stiff technical resistance around the 18,900 mark. 

All 30 Sensex constituents ended higher Friday.
