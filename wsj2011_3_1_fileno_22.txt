MUMBAI â€“ The spot price of silver in Mumbai rose Tuesday to an all-time high of 51,005 rupees ($1,127) a kilogram, the Bombay Bullion Association said, tracking firm overseas markets and investment demand. 

The previous high was 50,755 rupees a kilogram, reached Monday, the association said. 

Mumbai is India's largest bullion market and the country is the world's biggest bullion consumer and importer. 

Global spot silver hit a new 31-year high Tuesday, buoyed by a bullish mix of technical buying and improving industrial and investment demand. 

A Mumbai-based dealer said demand from the current wedding season in India and a good harvest of winter-sown crops is likely to support silver prices in coming days. 

In India, most farmers invest in gold and silver as they aren't exposed to other forms of asset classes.
