Texas on Tuesday became the third state to use a sedative long used to euthanize animals to carry out a lethal injection.

The state used pentobarbital along with two other drugs to execute Cary Kerr, who was convicted in 2003 of sexually assaulting and murdering Pamela Horton. 

A nationwide shortage of thiopental sodium, which has been used for years to carry out executions, has forced states to switch to pentobarbital. 

Oklahoma and Ohio previously used pentobarbital in executions. Its adoption by Texas, the nation's most active executioner, would signal that pentobarbital is likely to soon supplant thiopental as the death-penalty drug of choice for states, lawyers said. South Carolina announced Tuesday that it plans to use pentobarbital in an execution scheduled for later this week.

The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday denied Mr. Kerr's last-minute request for a stay of execution. He claimed that his trial and appellate lawyers failed to offer mitigating details about his troubled upbringing, said Brad Levenson, who represented Mr. Kerr in his Supreme Court appeal. 

The Texas Attorney General's Office declined to discuss the Kerr case.
