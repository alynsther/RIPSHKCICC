 fourth-quarter earnings rose 31%, beating analysts' estimates, driven primarily by higher auction commission revenue. 

The art auction house had struggled with drawing bidders during the economic downturn, but the art market has improved in recent months. 

Sotheby's reported a profit of $96.2 million, or $1.38 a share, up from $73.6 million, or $1.09 a share, a year earlier. 

Revenue leapt 46% to $318 million, of which $310.5 million came from auction and related revenue. 

Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had most recently forecast earnings of $1.32 a share on revenue of $298 million. 

Auction commission margin fell to 18% from 20.4%. The company attributed the decline to an increase in the number of works sold for more than $1 million, the point at which the buyer's premium rate falls to 12% from 20%. 

"Overall, aggregate auction sales through the first two months of 2011 solidly improved from the first two months of 2010," said President and Chief Executive  Bill Ruprecht. 

Shares were down 2% to $48.26 in after-hours trading Monday.
