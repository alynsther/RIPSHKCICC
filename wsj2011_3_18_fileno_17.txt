ROME—The Italian government is considering a law to protect strategic from being taken over by foreign companies, amid frustrations over a wave of mostly French corporate acquisitions of Italian companies. 

The government Friday said it is "planning a measure" to protect Italian companies that it deems strategic. 

Economy Minister Giulio Tremonti explained at Friday's cabinet meeting how a similar French law works, the prime minister's spokesman said. 

France has cast a protective shield around a number of its own companies, including yogurt-maker Danone, on the grounds they are of strategic importance to the country. 

Paris-based  LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton earlier this month announced a €4.2 billion ($5.89 billion) friendly takeover of  Bulgari SpA, the largest listed Italian luxury-goods company. 

Meanwhile, French insurer Groupama SA has offered to help recapitalize an Italian family-run investment vehicle in a move that would, if approved, give it a chance to exert control over  Fondiaria-SAI SpA, one of Italy's largest insurers by premiums.

 SpA in an apparent bid to have a say in the Italian dairy group's future. 

At the same time,  Fiat SpA Chief Executive  Sergio Marchionne has signaled that he expects the Italian car maker to merge with Chrysler Group LLC, and that the eventual headquarters might be in the U.S. 

Total capitalization of listed equity on the Italian Stock Exchange amounts to around 20% of Italian gross domestic product,one of the lowest figures in the industrialized world.
