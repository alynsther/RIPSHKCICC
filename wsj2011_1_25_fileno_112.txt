MUMBAI â€“ Indian shares fell to their lowest in more than a week Tuesday as a higher inflation forecast by the Reserve Bank of India raised fears of more monetary tightening and sparked a sell-off in rate-sensitive sectors such as banking and auto. 

The Bombay Stock Exchange's Sensitive Index slipped 181.83 points, or 1%, to close at 18,969.45 after moving between 18949.44 and 19340.99. On the National Stock Exchange, the 50-stock S&P CNX Nifty fell 55.85 points, or 1%, to end at 5687.4. 

Trading volume on the BSE rose to 36.24 billion rupees from Monday's 28.96 billion rupees. Gainers lagged decliners 1,207 to 1,639, while 161 stocks were unchanged. 

Earlier in the day, the RBI increased its key policy rates by 25 basis points--in line with estimates--but raised its inflation estimate for end-March to 7%, from 5.5% previously, and said that inflation remains the dominant concern. 

"The markets reacted more to the hawkish tone of the policy document rather than the rate increases...we expect another round of rate hikes as early as mid-February," said Ambareesh Baliga, vice president at Karvy Stock Broking. 

Analysts expect rate hike concerns to weigh on shares for the rest of the week. Indian markets are closed Wednesday for a public holiday.

Of the 30 Sensex constituents, 19 ended lower Tuesday. 

ICICI Bank fell 4.2% to 1038.3 rupees ($22.7) while  HDFC Bank closed 2.9% lower at 2087 rupees. 

"The central bank has also said it is important that credit growth is moderated, and has asked banks to align credit growth and deposit growth. This could have implications for banks' interest income," said a Mumbai-based analyst, who declined to be identified. 

Most auto shares also declined, with  Tata Motors down 1.9% at 1165.3 and Mahindra & Mahindra closing 2.3% lower at 770.5 rupees.

Consumer goods maker Hindustan Unilever fell sharply after the company's October-December earnings missed estimates due to surging raw materials costs. The stock lost 5.5% to finish at 281.65 rupees. 

Drug maker Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, which isn't part of the Sensex, fell 3.2% to 1,584.1 rupees after posting lower-than-expected third-quarter profit due to weak sales in overseas markets. 

Among Sensex gainers, state-run power producer NTPC was up 1.9% at 195.9 rupees while aluminum maker Hindalco Industries closed 1.3% higher at 235.1 rupees.

In the broader market, state-run oil retailers extended Monday's gains on hopes that falling crude prices would reduce their revenue losses from selling diesel and cooking fuels at subsidized prices. Bharat Petroleum was up 4.9% at 629.25 rupees while Indian Oil finished 2.1% higher at 336.7 rupees.
