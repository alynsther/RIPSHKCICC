SEOULâ€”South Korea's financial authorities on Thursday announced a plan to strengthen the supervision of the distressed savings-banks sector and to require the small lenders to meet higher fiscal standards. 

Financial Services Commission, Financial Supervisory Service and Korea Deposit Insurance Corp. said in a joint report that they will strengthen regulatory oversight of savings banks' corporate governance to ward off improper business practices at the banks as well as strengthen auditing processes. 

They also plan to introduce a regular review of the banks' biggest shareholders to see whether they are fit to have the largest say in how the banks' are operated. 

The authorities also plan to impose stricter fiscal requirements, such as tighter caps on how much in loans the savings banks can make and limits on how much in riskier assets the lenders can hold. They are also considering tougher ways to measure the savings banks' capital ratios to ensure their fiscal soundness. 

At the same time, the financial authorities also said they will continue directing distressed savings banks to shore up their finances through measures such as capital injection from their largest shareholders. The authorities said they will also support the lenders' restructuring processes through means such as acquiring some of their real-estate project financing loans that are at risk of becoming insolvent. 

For savings banks that cannot find a way to survive on their own, KDIC will pursue a quick sale of such lenders, the report said.
