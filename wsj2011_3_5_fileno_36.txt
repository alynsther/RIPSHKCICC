LONDON—Brook Lopez scored 25 points as New Jersey ended a six-game losing streak with a victory over the Toronto Raptors on Friday in the first regular-season NBA game played in Europe. Deron Williams added 16 points and 11 assists at the O2 Arena despite playing with injuries to both hands—a strained right wrist and bruised left hand. It was the All-Star guard's first win with the Nets since being acquired from the Utah Jazz last week.
