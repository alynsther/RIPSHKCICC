Marshawn Lynch's 67-yard touchdown run on Saturday can now literally be described as "earth-shaking." Geophysicists at the University of Washington's Pacific Northwest Seismic Network say that a seismic reader by Qwest Field picked up activity around 4:43 p.m. PT—just as Mr. Lynch reached the end zone. John Vidale, director of the PNSN, made the connection with the game. "It's a little bit unusual," he says, "But it's pretty clear that this was the fans going wild in the stadium."

Derrick Rose has led the Chicago Bulls to its best record since the Michael Jordan years, has received more All-Star votes so far than all but six players, and this season even has his own television sneaker commercial. At 22, he's blossomed into a full-fledged NBA star, albeit a reluctant one. The soft-spoken Mr. Rose says he misses the days when he could wander his hometown of Chicago and just be "Little Pooh from the neighborhood," referring to his childhood nickname because of a likeness to Winnie the Pooh. "You go to the same places but people look at you different. They look at me as like a celebrity or something, and that's not how I like being seen."

Teenagers are everywhere in college—everywhere except the field at the football national-title game. Just two of the 44 offensive and defensive starters in Monday's Auburn-Oregon showdown were under the age of 20, both on the Auburn side: sophomore tight end Philip Lutzenkirchen and redshirt freshman defensive end Nosa Eguae (both 19). Because of redshirts and junior-college transfers, the average age of both teams was beyond the drinking age: 21 years, 273 days for Auburn and 22 years, 20 days for Oregon.
