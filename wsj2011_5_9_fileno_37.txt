MUMBAI --Jyothy Laboratories has offered to buy up to 20% more of Henkel India at 41.20 rupees a share, the offer's manager said Monday. 

The open offer to buy about 23.3 million additional shares opens June 24 and closes July 14, manager Mape Advisory Group said in a newspaper advertisement. 

Last week, Jyothy Laboratories agreed to buy Henkel AG & Co. KGaA's entire 50.97% stake in its Indian unit. It had already bought a 14.9% stake in Henkel India from Henkel AG's local partner Tamilnadu Petroproducts in March. 

Jyothy has agreed to pay Henkel 20 rupees a share for the stake, compared with the 35 rupees a share it paid Tamilnadu Petroproducts for the minority stake. 

Indian laws require a company that acquires 15% or more of another firm to make an open offer to buy an additional 20%.
