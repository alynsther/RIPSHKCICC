MUMBAI --Jaguar Land Rover, a unit of India's Tata Motors Ltd., is planning to sell a benchmark-sized global bond as early as June, and has named four banks to manage the planned issue.

The move signals the growing confidence of the U.K.-based luxury car maker after posting revenue gains over the last five quarters. The company has recovered from the severe drop in sales during the global financial crisis and is now in a position to borrow on its own balance sheet, without the support of Tata Motors, investment bankers said.

Jaguar Land Rover has hired Citigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Credit Suisse Group and Standard Chartered PLC to manage the deal, one of the people told Dow Jones Newswires, but asked not to be named. 

The specifics of the bond deal, such as the exact size and currency of issuance, haven't been decided yet, the people said. 

Jaguar Land Rover said it is exploring various funding options to bolster its balance sheet but can't comment further at this stage. It said that any suggestions of finality in its plans are speculative. 

The funds are likely to be used to repay some of the debt taken by Tata Motors to fund the $2.3 billion purchase of Jaguar Land Rover from Ford Motor Co. in 2007. This will help deleverage the Indian auto maker's balance sheet by shifting some debt burden onto its now profitable U.K. unit, investment bankers said. 

The move would mirror a similar step by Hindalco Industries Ltd., which raised $2.5 billion through a bond sale by its North American unit Novelis in late 2010. The Indian metals producer had aquired Novelis in early 2007 and the bond sale allowed Hindalco more leeway to expand capacity and leverage in its Indian operations.
