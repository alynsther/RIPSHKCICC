NEW DELHI --India's economy is likely to record GDP growth of 8.5% in the fiscal year through March as the domestic economy continues to do well despite global uncertainty, the country's Prime Minister said Saturday. 

"In the last two quarters our growth rate has been 8.9% and we expect that for the entire year it will be around 8.5%," Manmohan Singh said at a seminar. 

He also said that economic growth is likely to be in the range of 9% to 10% from the next fiscal year starting April. 

"This growth is vital to fund our ambitious social development program and to create employment for our young population," he added.
