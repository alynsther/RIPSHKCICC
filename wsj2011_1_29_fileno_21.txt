The New French, in the West Village, is not quite what its name implies. "You could call it eclectic American," said owner  Philip Hoffman, "but I call it New York food." 

Weekend brunch at the New French is not quite what the name implies. Dishes range from pho to ricotta pancakes to homemade sausage.

"New York food" at the neighborhood spot includes a weekend brunch that ranges from pho to ricotta pancakes to home-made sausage. The Vietnamese noodle soup is offered in brisket or less traditional chicken versions ($16 and $14 respectively, with the regular accoutrements of basil, scallions and shallots). Big sellers include omelettes ($12, or $15 with bacon or sausage) and eggs prepared any style, with a side of home-style potatoes and greens ($9.50). "We get raves for our home fries," Mr. Hoffman said.

For a lighter bite, try the New French salad ($14), a crunchy mix of romaine, radicchio, pear, celery, multi-colored beets and manchego, with red wine-pear vinaigrette. Or add heft to anything with that home-made sausage, at $6 a side.
