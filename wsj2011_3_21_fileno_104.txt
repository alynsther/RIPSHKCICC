While the Big East has struggled to live up to expectations in the NCAA tournament, at least one conference is finally getting it done: the Mountain West. The MWC was 10-26 in the tournament with only two Sweet 16 appearances—none since 2007—before No. 2-seed San Diego State (pictured) and No. 3-seed Brigham Young advanced over the weekend. But the conference has seldom been the higher seed in its matchups. When it has, its record is 9-6.

Jon Jones, 23 years old, became the Ultimate Fighting Championship's youngest-ever champion on Saturday. The day was eventful even beyond that.
