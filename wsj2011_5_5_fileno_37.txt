MANILAâ€”The Philippine central bank Thursday further tightened monetary policy, raising overnight rates by 0.25 percentage point for the second time this year to temper inflation expectations in the wake of still-elevated global oil prices and "above-trend" economic growth. 

With the increases, which follow a similar-sized increase in March, the overnight rates now stand at 4.5% for borrowing and 6.5% for lending. 

The median forecast of 11 economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires projected the 0.25 percentage point increase. 

Earlier Thursday, the National Statistics Office released data that showed April inflation rising to a one-year high of 4.5%, slightly above economists' median forecast of 4.4% but within the 3.7%-4.7% projection of the central bank for that month. 

Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Deputy Gov. Diwa Guinigundo said that without the latest rate increase, inflation is projected to average 5.6% for 2011, above the central bank's target of 3%-5%. He said current estimates show that the economy could accommodate the total 0.50 percentage point increase in policy rates so far this year. 

The central bank said it is closely watching foreign capital inflows to ensure they won't substantially increase domestic liquidity.
