MUMBAI --India's central bank proposed on Wednesday revised guidelines for its 15-year-old primary dealers authorization policy in a bid to make it more transparent.

Primary dealers are underwriters in a government bond auction.

The revised rules will ensure the new primary dealers have sound capital, adequate experience and expertise in the government debt market and prudent risk management measures, the Reserve Bank of India said in a notification.

There were 20 primary dealers in India as of March 31, of which 12 are banks carrying on the business departmentally and the remaining eight are non-bank entities, known as stand alone primary dealers.

"There is a need that the prospective primary dealers have a track record of relevant experience on which an assessment of the entity's operational performance, control environment, and compliance position may be based," the central bank said.

At present, a non-banking finance company registered with the central bank for at least a year and with a year-long exposure to the government debt market are some of the main eligibility criteria to start the business.

The central bank has now proposed that the interested companies should have at least 15% of their turnover in the government debt business through the mid-segment such as provident funds, trusts and through individual retail investors.

Existing primary dealers would be given two years to comply with the minimum turnover requirement, it said.

For subsidiaries of entities incorporated outside India, the RBI has proposed that the parent foreign company should have been in the primary dealership business for three years or more in active markets.

The Indian subsidiary may also have to suitably ring fence its system from its parent to ensure the sanctity of its data and avoid any undue spillover of risk to its own operation, the RBI said.

The RBI has sought feedback on these guidelines by May 22.
