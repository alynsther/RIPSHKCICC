Rahm Emanuel's campaign for Chicago mayor has raised $10.6 million through Jan. 19, according to a statement from his campaign office. Mr. Emanuel also will be able to use $1.1 million transferred from his congressional campaign account, for a total of $11.7 million.

Mr. Emanuel's opponent Gery Chico, who has served as Mayor Richard M. Daley's chief of staff and president of Chicago Public Schools, raised $2.4 million from July 1 through Dec. 31, according to his filing Thursday with the Illinois State Board of Elections. 

Thursday is the deadline for candidates to submit their semiannual campaign-finance reports.

Polls show Mr. Emanuel, a Democrat running in a nonpartisan election, holds a big lead. The vote is set for Feb. 22 and if no candidate wins a majority a runoff between the top two contenders will be held April 5.

So far, Mr. Emanuel has successfully fought off a lawsuit brought by two city residents challenging his candidacy filed last year with the Chicago Board of Election Commissions. The suit claims he forfeited his city residency when he moved to Washington to become President Barack Obama's chief of staff.

The commission and a circuit judge have ruled in Mr. Emanuel's favor. Those decisions are being appealed and a ruling is expected this week. Whatever the outcome, the case is expected to go to the Illinois Supreme Court.

On Tuesday, former President Bill Clinton stumped for Mr. Emanuel in Chicago. Mr. Emanuel became Mr. Clinton's finance director during his first presidential bid and then served in the Clinton White House.
