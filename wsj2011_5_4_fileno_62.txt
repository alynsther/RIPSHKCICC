  Ted Forstmann, chairman and CEO of sports-and-entertainment conglomerate IMG Worldwide, has a life-threatening form of brain cancer, according to a person familiar with the matter, a development that could potentially throw into turmoil one of the most powerful companies in the sports industry.

Mr. Forstmann, 71 years old, has undergone surgery and is continuing medical treatments for the disease, which he has been battling for several weeks, according to the person familiar with the matter. However, Mr. Forstmann has continued to come into the office regularly, and the company has plans in place in the case of an emergency.

Mr. Forstmann and his firm, Forstmann Little & Co., became legendary in the leveraged-buyout world in the 1980s and 1990s. The company led takeovers of Dr Pepper and Gulfstream Aerospace, which Mr. Forstmann later sold for hundreds of millions of dollars in profits. 

Mr. Forstmann purchased IMG, then known as International Management Group, in 2004 for $750 million after the death of company founder Mark McCormack. While IMG has always been a multifaceted sports-marketing concern, during the past six years Mr. Forstmann has shifted its focus from athlete representation to deals that involve marketing major events and the content associated with them. IMG still represents golf great  Tiger Woods and tennis champions  Rafael Nadal and  Roger Federer, but it has also played a major role in the launch of Indian Premier League cricket and is a leader in the fashion industry. 

"Their overall concepts haven't changed, but the market dynamics have changed," said  David Carter, who teaches about the sports business at the University of Southern California. 

IMG has also become the leading owner of marketing rights in U.S. collegiate athletics and has also signed deals with overseas sports federations and media companies in India, Brazil and China.
