Environmental groups claimed a victory Tuesday when a unit of Australia-based Ambre Energy Ltd announced it withdrew its permit application for a proposed export terminal to ship coal mined in Montana and Wyoming to Asia via the Columbia River port of Longview, Washington. 

Millennium Bulk Terminals LLC's withdrawal follows months of protests by citizens opposed to construction of the terminal, which was permitted by Cowlitz County officials in November. Millennium Bulk Terminals said it would reapply for a permit to export from the Columbia River port after conducting a new environmental impact study. The project's budget was about $100 million, the company said, and was one of several coal-exporting terminals coal producers are seeking to develop on North America's Pacific coast to meet booming demand for U.S. coal in China.

Opponents of the Longview coal terminal include The Sierra Club, Earthjustice and the Washington Environmental Council. 

"This idea of turning Washington into a way station for coal -- which will pollute our atmosphere with tons of carbon dioxide and toxics -- is a losing idea for our health and our economy," said  Ross Macfarlane, Senior Advisor for Climate Solutions, another group opposing the terminal.
