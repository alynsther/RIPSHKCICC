ATHENS—Greece's unemployment rate continued to accelerate in December, rising to 14.8% compared with 10.2% in December 2009, the statistics service ELLSTAT said Wednesday. 

The December rate is also almost a full percentage point higher than the 13.9% rate recorded in November by the revamped national statistics agency. 

Greece is struggling through a protracted recession while undertaking a tough three-year austerity and reform program to cut its budget deficit. In 2009, Greece's unemployment rate averaged 9.5%. 

The number of people employed also fell further, to 4.23 million in December from 4.30 million a month earlier. 

Young people remain hardest hit by Greece's deepening recession, with 39% of those aged between 15 and 24 without a job in December, up from 28.9% a year earlier, the data showed. 

Women also continued to see fewer job opportunities than men, with the number of unemployed women at 18.7% in December, compared with 14.8% a year earlier. 

By region, the highest unemployment was in the Ionia Islands, where the jobless rate reached 23.1%, compounded by lack of off-season tourism jobs. In the Attica region, the province that includes Athens and is home to about half the country's population, unemployment was 14% in December, slightly higher than the rate of 13.9% in November, but much higher that the 9.2% rate recorded a year earlier. 

In its 2011 budget, the Greek government estimated that unemployment will rise to 14.5% in 2011 before peaking at 15% in 2012. However, labor unions say joblessness could reach as high as 20% this year. 

Since May of last year, Greece has been implementing a tough austerity program in exchange for a €110 billion ($152.9 billion)loan from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. 

In its official forecast, the IMF predicts that Greek unemployment will peak at 15.2% in 2012.
