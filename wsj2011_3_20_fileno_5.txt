CAIROâ€”The chief of the Arab League criticized allied air strikes in Libya on Sunday, potentially angering Western officials who were spurred to action in part by the league's March 12 endorsement of a no-fly zone.

"What has happened in Libya differs from the goal of imposing a no-fly zone and what we want is the protection of civilians and not bombing other civilians," Amr Moussa, the secretary general of the Arab League, told reporters. He said he was calling for an emergency meeting of the Arab League to discuss the situation in Libya, although it wasn't clear when it would take place.

Mr. Moussa is expected to soon step down from his role at the league and stand as a presidential candidate in Egypt, which is likely to hold elections later this year. There was speculation in Egypt on Sunday that his comments may have been mainly directed at a domestic audience; the Islamist and largely anti-Western Muslim Brotherhood is considered a major potential electoral power in Egypt.
