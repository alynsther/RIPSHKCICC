At the opening night of Design on a Dime at the Metropolitan Pavilion Thursday, guests were the first to shop inside of 60 custom-made "vignettes" created by some of New York's top interior designers. Items were discounted 50% to 70% and proceeds ($850,000 from Thursday alone) went to Housing Works, a group that serves the homeless and adults with HIV/AIDS. 

"The creative level here is off the charts," said  James Huniford, who founded the event, now in its seventh year. "The designers are having fun." ( Michael Bagley, for instance, installed Andy Warhol-esque portraits of Saddam Hussein, Moammar Gadhafi and Osama Bin Laden in his mini-room.) 

  Iman, a co-chairwoman of the evening, who has her own fabrics collection, had a vignette inspired by Morocco that included a 1994 lithograph portrait her husband,  David Bowie, made of her, as well as 10 of his signed CDs. It was much nicer, she said, than her dorm room at the University of Kenya, which "had absolutely no redeeming qualities to it." 

The designer  Charlotte Moss reflected that her most regretted taste-making had been when she was newly married "and I was trying hard to please my mother-in-law."

  Nate Berkus, design guru and television host, said his low moment in design was at the age of 11, "when I told my mother that I wanted my bedroom to be red, white, and grey. And I also got up on a step ladder to glue shards of mirror to my ceiling."

During that same era, none of his friends would sleep over, Mr. Berkus said, because his idea of a good time "was moving the furniture."
