Rinne Groff can pinpoint the moment she conceived her play "Compulsion" back to a September 1995 article she read about Meyer Levin, a playwright infamous for his obsession with Anne Frank. But then it took her well over a decade to complete a first draft. Now, in the week before "Compulsion" opens at the Public Theater, we asked Ms. Groff, 41, to tabulate everything else she accomplished during the 15-year period in which the play gestated. 

Life, and other work, happened: She taught at NYU, completed other plays, and wrote for a season on the Showtime series "Weeds." Five years ago, she married and has since given birth to two girls. She slept—a lot. "I am a person who likes to sleep," Ms. Groff said.

She didn't lose much time in the shower, though, especially when the writing was going well. "I can remember being single," she said, "and looking at the double-locked front-door thinking, 'OK, when did I last leave the apartment?'"

"Compulsion" was often on her mind—if not making it to the page. "When a play is really tricky and personal, it kicks around longer," she said. "That feels like a blessing to me now." 

She noted that she doesn't normally take so long to complete a play, nor is it particularly in her demeanor to take her time. "My husband and I got married six weeks after our first date," she said. "That's crazy, right?"
