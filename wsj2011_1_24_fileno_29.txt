Counting billionaires is always an imperfect science. Counting them in China is even less exact. 

None of this has stopped companies from trying to make a profit from counting the un-countable Chinese billionaires. The Hurun Report, founded by  Rupert Hoogewerf, the Luxembourgian who used to compile the list for Forbes, says there are at least 189 billionaires in China. But Mr. Hoogewerf has said "the real number may be more like 400 or 500," possibly surpassing the U.S.

Now, another company, the wealth-research firm Wealth-X, has its own count of mainland billionaires. It says there are 150 billionaires in China. They also count 4,700 people with a net worth of $30 million to $50 million. 

Wealth-X says it analyzes data from various government and banking sources, along with proprietary research and media reports.

Putting exact numbers on the Chinese rich is a fun parlor game. But in the end, the numbers are just well-researched and highly produced guesses.

What we do know is that the ranks of the rich in China are increasing. Wealth is moving East and at some point–whether it is this year or next year or 2020–the number of Chinese billionaires will likely surpass that of the U.S.

We also know that wealth even among the rich in China remains highly concentrated. Just how concentrated is, again, more guesswork. But Wealth-X says that the Chinese with a net worth of more than $500 million control $725 billion, or more than 40% of the total wealth of the ultrahigh net-worth Chinese.
