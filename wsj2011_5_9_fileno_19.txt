NEW DELHI --  Tata Motors Ltd. has started exporting the Nano minicar from April, a move that will likely help India's largest auto maker by sales further lift sales of the world's cheapest car and reduce its sole dependence on the home market.

The Mumbai-based company, which controls the Jaguar and Land Rover luxury car brands, exported 498 units of the Nano in the past month, according to data issued Monday by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers, the local automotive industry lobby group.

When contacted,  Debasis Ray, a spokesman for Tata Motors, confirmed that the company has started overseas shipments of the Nano, but said further details will be disclosed at a later date.

Executives at two parts suppliers to Tata Motors said in March that the company may start exporting the Nano to Indonesia, Thailand, Sri Lanka and Africa by December.

The oval-shaped Nano comes with a 624-cubic-centimeter, rear gasoline engine and currently costs 140,880 rupees ($3,151) for the base model at showrooms in New Delhi.

Tata Motors has said previously it plans to sell the Nano in developing as well as developed markets. The company has said also that it could start selling the Pixel, a new city car concept for Europe based on the Nano, in two to three years. The Pixel could be fitted either with a 1.2-liter, turbo-charged diesel engine, or an electric one similar to that used in its Indica Vista EV hatchback.

In the domestic market, sales of the Nano are showing a resurgence after falling to a record low of 509 units in November due to some incidents of the car catching fire that were featured prominently in local newspapers and on television.

Sales began to recover in February after the company offered enhanced safety features for the Nano free of cost and increased the warranty on the car to four years from 18 months. Tata Motors in April sold a record 10,012 Nano cars.
