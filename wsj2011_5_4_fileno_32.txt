NEW DELHI --Swiss cement maker Holcim Ltd. further strengthened its control of two of India's largest cement companies by sales, ACC Ltd. and Ambuja Cements Ltd., taking its stake in both of these subsidiaries to above 50%. 

Holcim increased its stake to 50.1% in ACC and 50.01% in Ambuja Cements through open market purchases last week, said Peter Gysel, a company spokesman.

"We had the right to creep up our shareholding by 5% per fiscal year," he said. "If there is an opportunity to buy, then we consider it. We want to increase our shareholding in India because we believe in the market." 

Mr. Gysel said the company bought a 0.8% stake in ACC Ltd., or 1.5 million shares, at 1,100 rupees a share. That puts the purchase cost was between $35 million to $40 million, depending on the exchange rate. 

He added that the company bought an additional 3.5% stake in Ambuja Cements for $195 million. 

Holcim's stake increase comes at a time when cement companies are expected to ride on strong demand from the construction and manufacturing sectors, as the country is seeking to spend $1 trillion on rebuilding its roads, ports, highways and building several affordable housing projects in the 2012-17 period. 

Mr. Gysel, however, denied persistent media speculation in India that Holcim is seeking to merge ACC and Ambuja. 

"There are no plans to merge [ACC and Ambuja]," he said. "However, we explore opportunities to improve the assets footprint and explore efficiencies between the two companies."
