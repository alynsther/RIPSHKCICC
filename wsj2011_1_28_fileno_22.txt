Assets in money-market funds fell $3.8 billion for the week ended Wednesday, the fourth consecutive weekly decline, as outflows from retail funds more than offset institutional-fund gains, according to the Investment Company Institute. 

The latest outflows followed a steep withdrawal of $35.08 billion in the prior week. 

Meanwhile, iMoneyNet on Wednesday reported assets grew $2.62 billion for the funds it tracks, rebounding from a steep $49.83 billion outflow the prior week. Cash has been moving in and out of the funds in recent months after hundreds of billions of dollars were pulled from money-market funds in the first half of 2010 as investors sought higher returns. Recent turmoil in the municipal-bond market sent some investors to money funds.

For the week ended Wednesday, total fund assets fell to $2.757 trillion, according to ICI. The four consecutive weekly outflows totaled $53.95 billion on an unrevised basis. 

Assets in the institutional class grew $1.26 billion to $1.822 trillion. Taxable government funds dropped $2.01 billion, putting asset levels at $626.71 billion. Nongovernment funds had inflows of $6.38 billion, moving their asset levels up to $1.076 trillion. Tax-exempt funds declined $3.11 billion to $119.09 billion. 

Meanwhile, retail funds had net outflows of $5.07 billion, putting asset levels at $935.87 billion. Taxable government funds fell $1.23 billion to $165.85 billion, while nongovernment funds had $2.15 billion of outflows, lowering the amount in them to $564.7 billion. Tax-exempt funds decreased $1.68 billion to $205.32 billion.
