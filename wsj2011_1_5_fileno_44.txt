NEW DELHI â€“ Reliance Industries Ltd. has hired global consultancy firms to advise on driving India's biggest company by market value toward the next stage of expansion, a person familiar with the matter said Wednesday. 

Reliance, the country's biggest natural gas producer, announced in June plans to get into the electricity business and re-enter the telecommunications sector as part of a diversification process. 

Reliance's billionaire chairman,  Mukesh Ambani, had then said the company was preparing specific plans for investments in clean, coal-based power projects. It also plans to enter nuclear power business when the government opens that sector to private companies. 

The announcements followed the scrapping of a non-compete agreement between Mukesh Ambani and his younger brother,  Anil Ambani, signed in January 2006 when they split the business empire of their late father Dhirubhai Ambani. 

Mumbai-based Reliance, which operates the world's biggest refining complex in western India's Gujarat state, has also interests in textiles and retail. The company had spent $3.4 billion in 2010 to buy into three U.S. shale gas projects with an aim to gain expertise to help it develop domestic reserves. 

"A few consultants have been hired," the person told Dow Jones Newswires. He declined to disclose the number of consulting firms that have been hired or identify them. 

The person said Reliance could be working with the consultants on preparing its plan for the company's next stage of transformation that could take several years.
