Bronx-born Kemba Walker used a crossover dribble and shoulder roll to shuck his defender right to the ground, then stepped back and swished the winning basket at the buzzer to power ninth-seeded UConn (24-9) past top-seeded Pitt, 76-74, and into the semifinals of the Big East Tournament. "It's special," said Walker, who was swarmed by teammates after the shot. "There is nothing like doing it in your hometown."

The three officials responsible for at least two blown calls in the final moments of St. John's 65-63 win over Rutgers on Wednesday have voluntarily withdrawn from the rest of the Big East Tournament, conference officials announced Thursday. In a statement, Big East Commissioner John Marinatto called the decision by the officiating crew of Jim Burr, Tim Higgins and Carl Walton "in the best interests of everyone involved." The officials were not made available for comment.

Hall of Famer Yogi Berra was hospitalized after a fall in the Yankee clubhouse Thursday morning, but he suffered no serious injuries and was released Thursday afternoon. Through an intermediary, Berra passed on that he was "feeling fine, resting comfortably."

At roughly 11:20 a.m., Berra was in the food line in the visiting clubhouse in Clearwater, Fla., where the Yankees were playing the Philadelphia Phillies, when he tripped over the carpet and fell backwards. 

He did not hit his head or lose consciousness. Paramedics were called, and Berra was taken to Morton Plant Hospital for observation. "He did not want to go to the hospital, but we had to make sure,'' Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. "When he left, he was in good spirits.''
