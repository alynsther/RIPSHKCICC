Forty of the world's top bull riders descend upon New York this weekend for the fifth annual Professional Bull Riders Madison Square Garden Invitational, a bull-riding event with tickets running up to $200. It's hard to find a real bull to practice on in New York, but last year's winner, Shane Proctor, and nine-time PBR World Finals qualifier Luke Snyder shared what it takes to make a good showing on one of their mechanical counterparts.

• "Have enough beer to drink, so you can get your courage up," said Mr. Snyder.

• "Make sure to make really good friends with whoever is running the bull. It's not like eight seconds with a real bull. If you piss off the ring guy, he can keep you on however long he likes," said Mr. Snyder.

• "Keep your chin down. Wherever your chin goes, that's where your body is going to go," said Mr. Proctor. 

• "Make sure your free hand is in front of you. It helps guide your direction," said Mr. Proctor.

• "Sit close to your hand holding the bull. It's like a teeter-totter, so you want to establish your center of gravity. If you sit too far back, you will fall off," said Mr. Snyder. 

• "Know you are going to wipe out, and know you are not going to look graceful, so have fun and just fall," said Mr. Snyder.

• "The mechanical bull is not a real bull; it's barely a training device. It's a carnival ride, so don't think you can ride a real bull after you get on. You need to go to a good rodeo school," said Mr. Proctor.
