 & Co.'s annual compensation per employee in its investment-banking unit fell 2.4% from a year ago, though the firm set aside 4% more for payouts to reward a higher headcount. 

The banking giant allocated $9.7 billion in compensation for the unit in 2010, up from $9.3 billion, a year ago. Per-employee compensation, however, was $369,651, down from $378,559, a year ago. The firm had to pay 1,660 more employees in the business as the size of its staff climbed 7% to 26,314 from 24,654 in 2009. 

J.P. Morgan's compensation figures are closely watched by Wall Street because it is the first big U.S. bank to report fourth-quarter results and should provide the first indication of annual payouts for the industry in 2010. 

In the fourth quarter, compensation as a percentage of net revenue was 30%, up from 11% a year ago. The compensation expense in 2009 was unusually low because the firm paid employees outside of the investment bank who still supported the unit as well as a U.K. tax on bonuses and a higher portion of equity payments in compensation packages. 

During a conference call with analysts, J.P. Morgan Chief Financial Officer  Douglas Braunstein said that excluding the U.K. bonus tax, the compensation ratio for 2010 was 35%, consistent with the firm's prior guidance of 35% to 40%. He said executives expect full-year compensation-to-revenue ratios to continue to be in that range. 

Overall revenue for the investment bank rose 26% from a year earlier, but profit fell 21%, in part because of higher expenses, including performance-based compensation. 

The unit's investment-banking fees, earned for advising companies and helping them raise capital, for example, were down 3% from a year ago as advisory and equity underwriting revenues each fell, while debt underwriting climbed 26%.
