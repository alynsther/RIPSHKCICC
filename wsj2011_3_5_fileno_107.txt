If you think of Tiki as the cocktail world's sugary cousin with a penchant for bad Hawaiian shirts, then you haven't had the good stuff. It's like judging jazz after hearing Kenny G and not Charlie Parker—unfair. As new, serious Tiki bars (Smuggler's Cove in San Francisco; Dram, Painkiller and Lani Kai in New York) are proving, these drinks can be as refined as a Manhattan. When mixing them at home, do as the pros do: Only use fresh juices. Don't worry about Tiki mugs. To non-Tiki converts, they can feel cloying. Instead, use a simple glass and dress it up with an orchid, a stick of sugarcane, or—why not?—an umbrella.
