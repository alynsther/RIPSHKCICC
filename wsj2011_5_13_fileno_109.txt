BRUSSELS—European Commission President  José Manuel Barroso has written to the Danish government to express concern about the country's decision to reintroduce border controls, a spokeswoman said Friday. 

The spokeswoman said the Commission's analysis "raises important doubts" as to whether the measures respect European Union treaties and international laws. 

She said Denmark's move "appears to put in question" EU laws. "We have concerns...and this is what we will be looking into in the next days," the spokeswoman said. 

In his letter addressed to Danish Prime Minister  Lars Rasmussen, Mr. Barosso said that in determining whether Denmark's additional border checks are "proportionate, the member state bears the burden of proof." 

"It must demonstrate that such measures are both apt to ensure observance of the legislation in question and indispensable to that end," Mr. Barroso wrote.

Separately,  Cecilia Malmstroem, EU Commissioner responsible for Home Affairs, signaled the EU would be prepared to take legal action if Denmark doesn't cooperate with the EU executive. 

"The Commission stands ready to continue the dialogue with Denmark. But it will, if needed, use the tools at its disposal to guarantee the respect of EU law," she said in a statement. 

Ms. Malmstroem called on Denmark "to refrain from taking unilateral steps and to make sure that any measures taken are in line with the relevant law." 

Denmark Thursday defended its decision to reintroduce controls at its borders with Germany and Sweden, denying that it was restoring passport checks. Denmark is part of the Schengen accord system, which allows for free movement of people around much of the EU.
