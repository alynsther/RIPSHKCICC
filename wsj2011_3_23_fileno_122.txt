You'll have to wait until Part Four of the new HBO miniseries "Mildred Pierce" airs to see the 23-year-old actress  Evan Rachel Wood vamp it up as Veda Pierce, the selfish and stubborn daughter of the title character, played by  Kate Winslet. (The film begins Sunday on the network.)

But Ms. Wood came to the premiere of the first two parts on Monday at the Ziegfeld and celebrated at the after-party at the Plaza, where a traditional big band entertained the crowd. She saw the beginning of the movie for the first time, in which an 11-year-old actress named  Morgan Turner, plays the same role.

"I thought she did an amazing job, but it was eerie and creepy," Ms. Wood said.

In the film, Ms. Wood plays a coloratura soprano, though she doesn't actually do her own singing. "I had to train for two months with a coach in three different languages," she said. "Everything was so dramatic: mimicking the dialect of the time and trying to sound Upper Class, learning how to act as if I was playing the piano. This role was the hardest thing I've ever done."

Ms. Wood, who also appears fully naked, was asked if it was especially difficult playing such a witch of a character. "Kind of yes," she said. "She really is a big one. I had nothing to draw from but it was interesting to try to make her sympathetic."

"I'm so excited about the buildup to the final parts," Ms. Wood added. "People are going to freak out. It gets crazier and crazier."
