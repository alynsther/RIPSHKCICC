MUMBAI â€“Indian shares closed higher Wednesday, erasing most of the previous session's losses, as expectations that the Reserve Bank of India will leave policy rates unchanged in its monetary policy review Thursday triggered a round of buying in rate-sensitive shares. 

The Bombay Stock Exchange's Sensitive Index also tracked advances in most other Asian markets to rise 191.05 points, or 1.1%, to 18358.69. On the National Stock Exchange, the 50-stock S&P CNX Nifty gained 61.5 points, or 1.1%, to end at 5511.15. 

Trading volume on the BSE fell to 33.81 billion rupees ($751 million) from Tuesday's 36.45 billion rupees. Gainers outnumbered decliners 1,804 to 1,064, while 107 stocks were unchanged. 

In Asia, Japan's Nikkei bounced 5.7% due to bargain buying despite fears about high radiation levels at an earthquake-damaged nuclear complex. China's Shanghai Composite rose 1.2%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng closed 0.1% higher. 

"Traders [in India] are covering short positions ahead of the RBI's policy meeting Thursday. The market has factored in a [0.25 percentage point] hike in policy rates but if rates are left unchanged, we could see sharp gains tomorrow," said  Alex Mathews, head of research at Geojit BNP Paribas Financial Services. 

India's central bank may raise the key lending and borrowing rates by 0.25 percentage point each to 6.75% and 5.75%, respectively, in its monetary policy review, according to 14 of the 15 economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires. 

Of the 30 Sensex constituents, 24 ended higher Wednesday. 

Banking led the gains due to hopes that the RBI will stand pat on policy rates. "Over the past three months, banks have aggressively raised interest rates, which are near the peak now. We don't see much scope for further tightening," said  Vaibhav Agrawal, a vice president at Angel Broking, adding that a slight increase in policy rates by the RBI won't be seen as a negative move. 

ICICI Bank rose 3% to 1,026.6 rupees, while State Bank of India closed 3.1% higher at 2,642.85 rupees. 

Reliance Industries, India's largest company by market capitalization, extended the previous session's gains to close 0.8% higher at 1,044.6 rupees. 

Shares of Reliance Group companies founded by  Anil Ambani resumed the good run which had started Monday after a group company, Reliance Capital, said it would sell a 26% stake in its life insurance unit to Japan's Nippon Life Insurance for 30.62 billion rupees. Reliance Infrastructure advanced 5.2% to 645.3 rupees, while Reliance Communications climbed 2% to 102.95 rupees. 

In autos, Mahindra & Mahindra rose 2.3% to 659.4, while  Tata Motors finished 1.7% higher at 1,162.7 rupees.
