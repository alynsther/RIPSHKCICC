This year's FA Cup has already lived up to its reputation as English football's version of March Madness.

Through three rounds of the old competition, we've already seen Stevenage Borough, from the fourth tier, overcome the Premier League's Newcastle United. Crawley Town, from the fifth division, is also through to the fourth round, while Liverpool—a seven-times FA Cup winner—is out.

Four second-division teams will play the part of banana skins this week when they are pitted against Premier League opponents in the tournament's third-round replays.

On Tuesday, Leicester City travels to Manchester City after the two sides drew 2-2 in the first encounter. Leicester has since signed Yakubu Aiyegbeni, who played for Nigeria in last summer's World Cup, and the former Everton forward scored Saturday on his debut. If selected, the powerful striker will be a threat to score first and is 21/10 with Bet365 to do so. 

Favorite in the first-scorer market is Manchester City's new £27 million ($43 million) signing Edin Dzeko, at 8/11, and the home team is strongly expected to win at 4/11 with William Hill.

Elsewhere, Cardiff City hosts Stoke City on Tuesday and the home team's good form on its own turf—where it has suffered just two defeats so far this season—suggests it may be worth backing the second-division team to cause an upset at 7/4. Stoke is eighth in the Premier League but has won on the road only three times this season.

Wolverhampton Wanderers welcomes Doncaster Rovers in Tuesday's other game and with Wolves struggling in the Premier League relegation zone, the top-flight team could rest players here. Wolves is odds-on but a small bet on Doncaster may be worthwhile at 4/1.

The final third-round replay takes place on Wednesday when Arsenal travels to Leeds United. A 1-1 draw at Arsenal's Emirates Stadium forced the replay but Arsenal looked imperious when beating West Ham 3-0 on Saturday. Expect Arsène Wenger's team to vindicate its position as 8/13 favorite.
