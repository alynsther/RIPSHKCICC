The last three winners of the Players Championship—Sergio Garcia, Henrik Stenson, Tim Clark—all finished in the top-10 at the PGA Tour's richest event the year before they won. This could be a good omen for Italy's Francesco Molinari, who finished ninth in his debut at The Players last year. Another steady player with an impressive record at TPC Sawgrass is Ben Crane, the only competitor in this week's field to finish in the top-10 each of the past three years.

The Fiesta Bowl will stay in college football's Bowl Championship Series, but the bowl will have to pay a $1 million fine and reform its board. The Fiesta's elite status had come into question amid revelations of illegal political contributions and financial improprieties involving former chief executive John Junker, who was fired in March. The fine will be donated to charity serving Arizona's youth.
