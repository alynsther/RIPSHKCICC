The Foreign Investment Promotion Board, the agency that approves foreign investments in India, approved 14 proposals from companies.

The board approved 12.89 billion rupees worth of investments, including that of Mauritius-based Ghir Investments, which proposes to infuse equity worth 5.3 billion rupees into an investment company.

The board also okayed Pipavav Shipyard's request to allow foreign investments in the company, though no details were given on which foreign entities would invest in the naval ship builder. 

Five proposals were rejected and 27 deferred. These actions were taken at the FIPB meeting on March 11 in New Delhi.
