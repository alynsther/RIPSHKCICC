Palio d'Asti, an Italian restaurant in San Francisco's Financial District, might be best known for its equestrian-theme décor and the $1 pizzas it serves during happy hour with the purchase of drinks.

The pizza tradition, started in 1997 to lure evening diners, draws a young crowd of bargain-seeking drinkers, said Dan Scherotter, the 41-year-old owner and executive chef.

At lunchtime, though, the restaurant is frequented by slightly older customers who work nearby for finance, law and real-estate companies. Among them is Bernard Lapointe, 47, a fund manager who recently met a friend there for lunch.

Mr. Lapointe, an amateur chef himself, said he enjoyed his ravioli di zucca ($17), a dish of pumpkin ravioli in brown sage butter, topped with Brussels sprouts, piave cheese and amaretti crumbs. He added, however, "The sauce was a bit too liquid." (Mr. Scherotter said the juice from the Brussels sprouts thins the sauce and helps dilute the butter.)

Other favorites on the menu include risotto (prices vary) and the insalata di pollo arrosto, a roasted-chicken salad ($18), the chef said.

One draw of Palio d'Asti, for those who hold meetings over lunch, is the old-school décor of carpets and sound-absorbing ceiling tiles. "You can have a comfortable business lunch, rather than eating in a deafening shoe box of metal and concrete," Mr. Scherotter said.

Palio d'Asti is located at 640 Sacramento St. in San Francisco and serves lunch from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Monday through Friday.
