LONDON --U.K. insurer  Legal & General Group PLC is looking for more bancassurance deals in emerging markets--possibly in China--to help distribute its insurance products, Chief Executive Officer  Tim Breedon said Thursday. 

"The Indian joint venture is doing very well," Mr. Breedon told reporters. "The first full year of trading sold over 130,00 policies. Going forward, we'd like to replicate the Indian success in other emerging markets when opportunities are there."

L&G's bancassurance joint venture in India is called India First, set up with India's Bank of Baroda and Andhra Bank. 

L&G said it has recently received a permit to set up a representative office in China. 

"China is large, it's growing, it has a big middle class and its banking sector is well developed," Mr. Breedon said. "If the right deal could be done, if we could find the right bancassurance deal in China, we'd be interested."
