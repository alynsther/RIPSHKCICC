European stocks ended a bumpy session in the red Wednesday, led lower by oil majors and bank issues, amid continuing concern over the unrest in North Africa and the Middle East, and as sovereign debt fears resurfaced. The euro was little changed against the dollar, while oil and gold prices fell slightly. 

The Stoxx Europe 600 index closed down 0.2% at 281.17. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 index fell 0.6% to 5937.30, France's CAC-40 index ended down 0.6% at 3993.81 and Germany's DAX slipped 0.5% to 7131.80. 

Oil and gas stocks were the biggest drag, as investors worried that the unrest in Libya and the Middle East might hurt oil companies' earnings. The Stoxx Europe 600 index for the sector ended down 1.1%, as did the index for basic resources. 

Meanwhile, Portugal's bond auction failed to alleviate concerns that the country might need a bailout. Although the Treasury managed to sell the maximum intended €1 billion two-year government bonds, it came at a high price. The average yield was below secondary-market levels but sharply above the previous auctions, showing that market participants have become more wary in their assessment of the country. 

On Thursday, U.K. industrial production is at 0930 GMT and the Bank of England interest-rate decision is at 1200 GMT. In the U.S., initial jobless claims and trade balance are at 1330 GMT. 

By the time of the European stock markets close, the single currency was trading at $1.3908 from $1.3899 late Tuesday. Sterling last traded at $1.6197 from $1.6157 and the dollar was at 82.79 yen from 82.69 yen.

Late in Europe, light, sweet crude for April delivery was down 39 cents at $104.63 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Gold for April delivery was down 0.2% at $1,425.68 per troy ounce late in Europe on the Comex division of Nymex. 

In major market action: Travel and leisure issues racked up healthy gains, lifted by Deutsche Lufthansa, whose shares roase 2.7% following well-received full-year 2010 results. At the same time, upbeat 2010 numbers from European Aeronautic Defence & Space reinforced the sector's upward trajectory, helping the Stoxx Europe 600 travel and leisure index to close up 0.9%. EADS rose 1.1%.

On the corporate front, merger activity added some color to the proceedings. Rolls-Royce added 3.2% after it beefed up its bid for Germany's Tognum, through a joint venture with Daimler. This also pushed Daimler's shares up 1.2%. Shares of Tognum jumped 7.3%.

 Oil stocks gave back some of the prior day's gains. Shares of Total fell 1.3% in Paris, and in London, Royal Dutch Shell fell 1.5% and BP lost 1.8%.

Also in London, Tullow Oil sank 3.2%. The group's 2010 profit jumped to $54 million from $25.2 million. Its pretax profit of $152 million, however, missed consensus forecasts.

Banking shares also weakened. In Paris, shares of Credit Agricole dropped 2.5%, and Société Générale fell 1.8%. In London, shares of Barclays fell 1%. In Madrid, shares of Banco Santander slipped 0.4%.

Alcatel-Lucent fell 2.6% in Paris. U.S. fiber-optic-equipment maker Finisar delivered a disappointing fourth-quarter forecast late Tuesday, saying it sees further inventory correction and a slowdown in China.

"Given that Finisar supplies to Alcatel-Lucent and Ericsson, we view Finisar's results and weak guidance as negative for both stocks," said Didier Scemama, analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland, in a note.

Shares of Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson fell 1.2% in Stockholm.

Elsewhere in the telecommunications space, shares of Nokia rose 1.7% in Helsinki. The mobile-phone maker was upgraded late Tuesday to market perform from underperform by Bernstein analyst Pierre Ferragu, who said the company could meet low market expectations in the short term.

Meanwhile, insurer Prudential PLC rose 4.9% in London after reporting its 2010 net profit more than doubled, beating expectations. It also lifted its dividend by 20%.
