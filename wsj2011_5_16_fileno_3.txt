In May 2009, Indian markets bottomed out, and a few months later analyst Pathik Gandotra put a buy rating on  Housing Development Finance Corp., a rating he kept there for the duration of 2010.



The move gave investors listening to the advice of Mr. Gandotra, a 40-year-old financial services analyst with brokerage IDFC Securities, a 37% return on the stock for the year and helped him to grab the No. 1 ranking in this year's Asia's Best Analysts survey in the banks and financial services industry.

HDFC was a star pick "because of its very strong and growing franchise," he said. 

"HDFC was the most quality name, interest rates were low, and other banks and retail finance lenders had backed off the housing loan business," he said.

Another star pick in 2010 for Mumbai-based Mr. Gandotra was  Bajaj Auto Finance Ltd. He says the company suffered after being recapitalized three to four years because of significant credit losses, and he put a buy call on the stock—which had a full-year return of 115%— from September through the end of the year.

"It was recapitalized by the management. They hired a very good management team, which has gone into the business of consumer finance, two-wheelers, loans against shares, and property and personal loans," Mr. Gandotra said. "Its asset quality is very good."

This year, too, Mr. Gandotra, a former credit analyst, has buy ratings on both companies' stocks, but he says he is more bullish on  ICICI Bank Ltd., the country's second-largest lender by assets, after State Bank of India.

"ICICI Bank had demonstrated in the last two years under the new management that it is able to become more profitable by not growing, by curtailing its growth," he said. "We believe this year it will demonstrate it can grow and still be profitable."
