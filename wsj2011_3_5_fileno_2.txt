DAMMAM, Saudi Arabiaâ€”The Saudi government has banned all protests and marches in the kingdom, according to a statement Saturday from the Interior Ministry carried on the state-owned television channel al Ekhbariyah.

Any attempt to cause public disorder will be prevented by security forces, the Saudi channel said, without elaborating.

The ban follows small-scale protests in the oil-rich Eastern Province towns of al-Ahsa and Qatif, home to Saudi Arabia's Shiite minority.

On Thursday, Saudi authorities detained 22 people in Qatif after they staged a demonstration demanding the release of prisoners they say are being held without trial.

"About 200 people took to the streets in Qatif on Thursday night. The protests were peaceful, but still the authorities interfered, they tried to stop them and arrested 22 people," Human Rights First, an independent rights group, said.
