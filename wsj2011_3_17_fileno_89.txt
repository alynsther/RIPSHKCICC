It wasn't exactly your mother's Tupperware party. 

Tuesday at the penthouse of the Setai Fifth Avenue, there were no silly games, no Swedish meatballs and no packets of money-saving recipes. In place was an impromptu performance by R&B singer Deborah Cox with John Legend on piano, a four-course meal by chef Michael White and a booklet with instructions on how to make veal with pancetta cream sauce.

The idea of this "TupperClub" dinner was to put a fresh spin on the 65-year-old company nostalgically known for its burping, plastic containers. It was about "conversation, the art of it, the people who become dear to you in life," said Rick Goings, chairman and CEO of Tupperware.

And so there was a purposefully odd mix of guests: Eames Demetrios, grandson of legendary designers Charles and Ray Eames; Dhani Jones, a linebacker for the Cincinnati Bengals and Irina Shabayeva, a winner of the television show "Project Runway."

Singer Ashanti came with her mom and manager Tina Douglas, who is a veteran of the old-style of Tupperware parties with friends in pajamas. "I heard back in the day that women had them," said Ashanti, "but this is my first and it's super-duper cool."

Comedian Caroline Rhea chatted up Giants linebacker Jonathan Goff. It was not Ms. Rhea's first Tupperware party. "That's my secret, I would like to be a Tupperware lady," she said. "Well, maybe not anymore, but as a child I did."
