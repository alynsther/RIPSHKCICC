LONDON—European stock markets declined, led by a drop in financial shares, as concerns mounted over Greece's debt burden and as Standard & Poor's cut the country's credit rating.

The euro touched a three-week low, and U.S. stocks struggled to overcome that headwind, despite deal activity and a bounce in commodity prices.

Greece's ASE Composite index dropped 1.5% to 1349.91, pulling down other markets as investors questioned the financial health of other governments. Spain's Ibex 35 lost 2% to 10396.30, and Italy's FTSE MIB dropped 1.3% to 21666.40. The broader Stoxx Europe 600 index shed 0.3% to 280.43, its fourth loss in five sessions.

S&P said it lowered its long-term rating on Greece to single-B, from double-B-minus, and cut its short-term rating to C, from B, because of concerns that euro-zone officials are looking to extend the debt payment maturities of the European Commission's portion of the nation's 110 billion euro ($159 billion) bailout.

European governments have agreed to spend the next several weeks reviewing ways to provide more financial aid to the ailing nation and to review the terms of the original bailout.

"You only need to look at bond prices to know that Greece cannot raise money in the markets. The market is saying that the Greek debt will need to be restructured at some point," said  Gary Jenkins, head of fixed-income research at Evolution Securities.

"The key thing is that the EU is not trying to save Greece as much as to save itself. The last thing they want to do right now is to restructure the debt. But I believe the situation is going to be fragile for years," he added.

Financial shares across Europe slumped. Among the sharpest losers were  National Bank of Greece, down 4.1%, and Spain's BBVA, down 3%.  Commerzbank slumped 3.1%, and  BNP Paribas dropped 2.7%.

The euro currency fell on worries about Greece. Midday in New York, it traded at $1.4302, from $1.4353 late Friday in New York, while the dollar was at ¥80.59 yen, little changed on the day.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 58 points, or 0.5%, to 12696, in midday trading. Nymex crude for June delivery was up $3.88, or 4%, to $101.06 a barrel, while gold for May delivery gained $16.80, or 1.1%, to $1,508.00 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Among European benchmarks, The U.K.'s FTSE 100 index fell 0.6% to 5942.69, France's CAC-40 index ended down 1.3% at 4007.26, and Germany's DAX shed 1.1% to 7410.52. 

  Munich Re fell 1.7% as the reinsurer swung to a first-quarter loss, hit by the recent string of earthquakes, floods and other disasters.

  ING Groep slumped 4.4%. The bank said it will only resume paying a dividend after state funds are fully returned, which is scheduled to happen by May 2012.

  Barclays fell 1.3% after the bank followed  Lloyds Banking Group and said it will take a £1 billion ($1.64 billion) provision in the second quarter to compensate customers for mis-selling payment protection insurance.  HSBC Holdings declined 0.5% after the group took a $440 million provision for the same reason. The banking giant also reported a 58% jump in first-quarter profit thanks to a lower tax bill but core profit declined 10%.

  Scania rose 3.7% and  MAN added 1.5% after  Volkswagen on Monday raised its stake in MAN and said it will boost the holding to as much as 40% to forge a deeper alliance and generate more cost savings between the two companies and Scania. VW lost 2.1%.

U.K. utility  Centrica fell 3.8% after it warned that 2011 earnings will grow at a more subdued pace than previously forecast.

  Thomas Cook Group fell 2.9% after the London-listed travel operator posted a first-half loss as political unrest across the Middle East and North Africa disrupted the travel plans of many of its customers.

  Inmarsat rose 4.4% as the satellite operator posted a 51% jump in pretax profit and confirmed its revenue outlook.

In Ireland, drug company  Elan rose 2.2% after it sealed a deal to sell its drug technology unit EDT to U.S.-based  Alkermes for $960 million in cash and shares.
