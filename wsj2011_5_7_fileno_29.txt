WASHINGTON -- The National Labor Relations Board filed suit against the state of Arizona Friday, challenging the legality of a state constitutional amendment that requires workers to hold a secret-ballot election to decide whether to unionize a company. 

The agency argues that the state cannot override a federal law that gives workers the option of the so-called card-check method of organizing, in which workers sign cards indicating their interest in forming a union. Labor groups favor the method, while many employers oppose it. 

The lawsuit comes amid an uproar from business groups and Republicans over a separate NLRB action against  Boeing Co.

 Two weeks ago, the agency alleged that Boeing violated federal labor law by building a second production line for its 787 Dreamliner at a non-union factory in South Carolina. The agency sided with union workers in Washington State who said Boeing's action was retaliation for past labor strikes. 

The NLRB had warned in January that it might pursue lawsuits against Arizona and three other states that passed similar amendments on unionization rules. It still plans to sue South Dakota in the coming weeks but said it won't sue South Carolina and Utah as threatened because of limited resources. 

The Arizona suit is the latest in a series of recent NLRB decisions that have sided with unions, which are struggling to remain relevant after years of declining membership and recent attempts by states to curb union bargaining power. 

Opponents of the recent decisions say they are evidence that the agency and its board, now dominated by Democrats, are too loosely interpreting federal labor law to award favors to unions at the expense of businesses and states' rights. 

In the Boeing case, the company called the NLRB complaint "legally frivolous" and a "radical departure" from precedents, and vowed to fight it. The complaint had been sought by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers union.
