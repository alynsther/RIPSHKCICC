MUMBAI â€“Tata Steel Ltd.'s 34.77-billion rupee ($765 million) follow-on public offering had received bids covering almost half of the issue size by the end of Thursday, its second day, as investor appetite for the sale picked up. 

The world's seventh-largest steelmaker by capacity is selling 48.68 million shares through Friday in an indicative price band of 594 rupees-610 rupees a share. 

According to National Stock Exchange data Thursday, Tata Steel has received bids for more than 23.36 million shares, or about 48% of the total, mostly at the upper end of the price range. 

The share sale was covered about 20% at Wednesday's close. 

Tuesday, 25 funds, including the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Macquarie Bank Ltd.,  Credit Suisse Ltd., the government of Singapore and entities of  HDFC Bank Ltd. and  ICICI Bank Ltd. successfully bid for the anchor investor portion of the offer. 

Tata Steel's board approved the allotment of about 8.3 million shares at 610 rupees each to the anchor investors, raising 5.08 billion rupees. 

Anchor, or cornerstone, investors help boost the prospects of an issue by agreeing not to sell shares for a set period, giving subsequent investors a degree of confidence. They are allocated shares before an issue opens to the public. 

Tata Steel plans to use the issue proceeds to partly finance the expansion of its plant in the eastern Indian city of Jamshedpur to 10 million metric tons a year from 6.8 million tons. 

It also plans to use the proceeds to repay debt and for general corporate purposes. 

Tata Steel, which produces 27.2 million tons of steel a year, has other plants in Singapore, Thailand, the U.K., South Africa and the Netherlands. It also plans to build two more factories in India.
