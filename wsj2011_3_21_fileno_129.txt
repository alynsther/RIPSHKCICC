My wife has often mentioned that she would like to move to a home near the beach in retirement. I certainly enjoy vacations at the beach, but I question whether we (read: I) would enjoy living there full time. It's not a decision we have to make tomorrow, but it's one we'll face relatively soon.

That challenge—deciding whether and where to move in later life—is the focus of our cover story. Baby boomers, who are starting to turn 65, seem more willing to relocate in retirement than their parents. But as Kathleen Hughes, a former Journal reporter, found in speaking with couples across the U.S., settling on a destination can be harder than you think.

Elsewhere in this issue, we look at the growing popularity of hand cycles, "apps" that can improve your health, and a retiree who is making a new life for herself in Florence, Italy. That's one issue I won't have to negotiate; my wife is quite content with beaches in the U.S.

As always, we look forward to hearing your comments.
