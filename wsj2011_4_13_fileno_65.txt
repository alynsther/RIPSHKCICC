Khan Kabab House is aptly named: Kebabs rule at this unpretentious restaurant with unadorned walls and the smell of freshly cooked meat and tandoori naan or hot bread.

Lunch platters of tandoori chicken or goat curry come with basmati rice and fresh salad ($7.99). The kebab rolls come loaded with cubes of meat and tomatoes, and range from the shish kebab parantha roll ($4.75) to chicken tikka roll ($5.99). Vegetarian dishes include bhindi masala (okra), chickpeas and lentils ($5.25). 

"Mostly people phone and take out food on the way home," says owner and manager  Saeed Ahmad.
