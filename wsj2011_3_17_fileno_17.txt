 workers shut down the gas flow to the pipeline, which released a "ball of flames" at an intersection near Interstate 35 W, Minneapolis Assistant Fire Chief Cherie Penn said.

The started at about 9:45 a.m. EDT, Ms. Penn said, and emergency responders evacuated residents and employees at a nearby grocery store and closed parts of two highways while CenterPoint employees worked to shut off the gas. The fire was extinguished after the gas was shut off shortly before 11 a.m.

"Emergency responders let [the fire] burn off," Ms. Penn said. "The heat from the flames was so intense. We stood back and cordoned off the area."

Ms. Penn said there were no injuries and residents were allowed to return to their homes after responders detected no gas in the surrounding area. She said emergency personnel were checking nearby buildings for damage.

Houston-based CenterPoint, a natural-gas and electricity distributor, said in a statement it was investigating fire.

The fire came amid growing concern about the safety of the U.S. natural-gas-distribution infrastructure following a series of deadly incidents.

The National Transportation Safety board this month held hearings investigating the September explosion and fire in a residential neighborhood in San Bruno, Calif., that killed eight people.

An employee of a city-owned utility in Philadelphia was killed in a gas-line explosion in January, and five people were killed in February when a gas-fueled blast destroyed two homes in Allentown, Pa.

CenterPoint is Minnesota's largest natural-gas utility, serving about 800,000 customers.
