MUMBAI -- SKS Microfinance Ltd. said it has reduced its "effective" rate of interest to 24.55% a year across India from Tuesday.

SKS said also that it now won't collect charges for any credit shield, as well as loan processing fees and card fees.

"With this all, effective interest rates across the country will be 24.55% for all future disbursements," the company said in a filing with the Bombay Stock Exchange.

It didn't give further details, its previous rate of interest or make clear what "effective" means.

The microfinance sector has been subject to new regulations amid political criticism in its biggest Indian market--the southern state of Andhra Pradesh--after concerns arose over some firms' allegedly coercive recovery practices, and their pushing of borrowers into a debt trap.

Microfinance institutions borrow from banks and usually lend less than $200 to the poor who use the money to start or expand small businesses.
