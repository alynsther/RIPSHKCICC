CHICAGO—A Cook County circuit judge ruled Tuesday that former White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel is eligible to run for mayor of Chicago. 

Objectors argue that Mr. Emanuel doesn't meet the city's one-year residency requirement because he lived in Washington for two years while working for President Barack Obama. Mr. Emanuel moved back to Chicago in October.

But Cook County Circuit Court Associate Judge Mark Ballard wrote in an opinion that Mr. Emanuel's residency is covered by the election code that "protects the residential status of Illinois citizens who serve the national government."

Mr. Emanuel "never formed an intention to terminate his residence in Chicago and never formed an intention to change his residence," the judge wrote.

In December, the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners unanimously voted to allow Mr. Emanuel on the ballot. But Burton Odelson, an attorney for two of the objectors, appealed the ruling. After Judge Ballard issued his ruling Tuesday, Mr. Odelson said he would appeal to an appellate court and, if need be, take the case to the Illinois Supreme Court.

The election is scheduled for Feb. 22. If no candidate wins a majority, a runoff between the top two contenders will be held on April 5.

According to most polls, Mr. Emanuel leads the race by more than 20 points. Over the weekend, Congressman Danny Davis dropped out of the race and threw his support behind former U.S. Senator Carol Moseley Braun. In a city that is about one third African-American and where race has long played a critical role in politics, Ms. Braun is now the only major African-American candidate remaining in the race.

Also vying to succeed Mayor Richard M. Daley is Gery Chico—a former chief of staff to Mr. Daley, and Chicago City Clerk Miguel Del Valle.
