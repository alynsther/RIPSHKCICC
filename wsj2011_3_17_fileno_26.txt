LONDONâ€”The U.K.'s financial regulator broke ranks with its colleagues in Europe Thursday, urging banks to include the risk of a sovereign-debt restructuring in the euro zone in their stress tests. 

"In their stress testing, firms should consider a range of policy options in the euro-area peripheral countries, including a prolonged period of austerity and possible restructuring of bank and sovereign debt," the Financial Services Authority said in an annual survey that assesses the main risks facing the U.K.'s financial sector. 

The stress testing the FSA refers to in this case is the routine supervisory exercise it carries out on a rolling basis with U.K. banks. It has no relation to this year's round of European Union stress tests that were recently launched by the European Banking Authority. 

The FSA's advice highlights the difference between the risks regulators are actually monitoring, and the ones they are officially admitting to. The EBA's tests will probably exclude a sovereign-debt restructuring. 

In a briefing, FSA Chairman  Lord Adair Turner said the FSA's non-public tests are tougher than their public EU equivalents, but said he still expects the EU tests to be "a worthwhile exercise." 

Under the FSA's own methodology, banks are required to have at least a 4% ratio of core Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets in a hypothetical scenario that foresees: a cumulative drop of 4.3% in U.K. gross domestic product between 2011 and 2015; a 20.7% drop in house prices; a 36.4% fall in commercial property prices; and a peak jobless rate of 12.4%. 

Mr. Turner noted that the U.K. banking sector's exposure to the financially-stressed members of the euro zone is "moderate" and manageable, especially its direct exposure to sovereign and bank debt. However, a lot of it is tied to both residential and commercial property markets, which remain depressed in both Spain and Ireland, where U.K. banks' exposure is highest.
