What does it take to convince Donald Trump to allow his sex life, business failures, presidential aspirations and, of course, his distinctive head mop to be mocked in the crudest possible terms for two solid hours? 

Apparently $2 million, courtesy of Comedy Central, which paid tribute to Mr. Trump with a celebrity roast Wednesday at the Hammerstein Ballroom. The guest list included his daughter Ivanka, John Legend, Jon Hamm, Larry King and Snoop Dogg. Cruising in atop a gold Escalade golf-cart spitting out dollars bills, the mogul took the hot seat expecting the worst. 

"I will sit up there and they will ridicule every part of my body, especially my hair," he said prior to the taping, which will air next week on the network. "But by doing it, I'm giving a tremendous amount of money to charity, AIDS research and others."

Mr. Trump's prediction came to pass, starting with "Family Guy" creator Seth McFarlane: "You look like you fell head-first into a cotton candy machine." By more vulgar turns, comedians and friends also mocked Mr. Trump's penchant for dating younger women and his prospective bid for the presidency.

"Trump says he wants to run for President," said Snoop Dogg. "So what? Wouldn't be the first time he pushed a black family out of their home."

Mr. King got in some shots of his own: "You're a New York landmark," he told Mr. Trump. "Which means it's only a matter of time before they bulldoze you and put up a tacky, gaudy building."

While most of the zingers hit their targets, Mike "The Situation" Sorrentino's timing and topics were so off, the "Jersey Shore" star found himself nearly booed offstageâ€”especially after insulting Snoop Dogg with a racially insensitive joke. 

Perhaps Oscar winner Marlee Matlin best summed up the performance: "Like the Situation, I, too, have never heard the sound of laughter," she signed.
