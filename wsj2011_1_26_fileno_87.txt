DETROITâ€”The Nigerian man accused of attempting to bomb a jet bound for Detroit on Christmas Day 2009 will go to trial nearly two years after his arrest, a federal judge ruled Tuesday.

Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab previously indicated he might consider pleading guilty to at least some of the charges. But so far he has pleaded not guilty and no real progress has been made to resolve the case.

The most serious felony charges, which include terrorism-related counts, carry a maximum penalty of life in prison.

U.S. District Judge Nancy G. Edmunds said the trial would begin Oct 4. Documents will be brought to the prison where Mr. Abdulmutallab is being held because he has elected to represent himself, Judge Edmunds said Tuesday. Mr. Abdulmutallab asked for more time, suggesting the trial be postponed until the end of the year or 2012, but the judge rejected that request.

A standby attorney for the defendant said in court that the case could involve 400 witnesses, suggesting the trial could last weeks or months.

Prosecutors accused Mr. Abdulmutallab, the 24-year-old son of one of Nigeria's richest men, of detonating an explosive device in his underwear on a Northwest Airlines flight from Amsterdam to Detroit. But the bomb didn't fully explode and the plane was fine. 

The original charges filed included attempting to murder 278 passengers and 11 crew members.
