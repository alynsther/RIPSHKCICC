TOKYOâ€”A 7.3-magnitude earthquake hit near northern Japan Wednesday morning, with the tremors felt as far as away as Tokyo, 260 miles to the south.

There were no immediate reports of damage.

The quake was centered 100 miles off the coast and was about nine miles underwater, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. 

The Japan Meteorological Agency issued a tsunami alert issued for northeastern coast of Japan, predicting modest waves of up to 20 inches.

The quake registered a lower 5 on the Japan scale of up to 7 in Miyagi Prefecture in the northern part of Japan's main Honshu island. A quake of that scale means that hanging objects would likely swing violently from the tremors, small objects could fall off shelves and people in the area would likely attempt to escape from damage. 

The Japan Meteorological Agency's seismic intensity scale measures what people would actually feel at the location, as opposed to the U.S. Geological Survey reading, which measures the energy released by a quake at its epicenter.
