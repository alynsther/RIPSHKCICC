MUMBAI -- India's central bank said Monday it has constituted a panel to look into issues relating to the regulation of non-banking finance companies.

"The recent global financial crisis has also highlighted the regulatory imperatives concerning the non-banking financial sector and the risks arising from regulatory gaps, arbitrage and systemic inter-connectedness," the Reserve Bank of India said in a statement.

The six-member panel is chaired by  Usha Thorat, a former RBI deputy governor and director at the Centre for Advanced Financial Research and Learning. The panel will focus on defining and classifying non-banking finance companies, regulatory gaps, governance standards and the appropriate approach for the sector's supervision, the RBI said.
