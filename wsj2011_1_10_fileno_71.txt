Jason Arnott scored the go-ahead goal in a five-goal third period, and Martin Brodeur made 33 saves to lead the struggling Devils to a victory over the Tampa Bay Lightning on Sunday night at Prudential Center.

David Clarkson scored twice and Dainius Zubrus, Patrik Elias and Nick Palmieri added late insurance goals as the Devils snapped a four-game losing streak and won for only the third time in 18 games.
