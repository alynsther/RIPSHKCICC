Godrej Household Products Ltd will no longer sell Kiwi shoe care and Kiwi Kleen brands in India and Sri Lanka.  Sara Lee Corp., the American company, has terminated Godrej's license and will pay 1.77 billion rupees($37.9627 million) to end the relationship.

  Adi Godrej, chairman of Godrej Consumer Products, the parent of Godrej Household, said "shoe care is a non-core business for us."

He added that the agreement helped Godrej to continue focusing on its core categories â€“ personal wash, hair care and home-care products -- in emerging markets of Asia, Africa and Latin America.

Godrej Consumer Products manufactures and sells several well-known brands, including Good Knight mosquito repellants and Cinthol soaps and talcum powder.

The break-up of the licensing agreement marks the end of a 15-year relationship between Godrej and Sara Lee. Over the past year, following the leveraged buyout of Sara Lee, its international business was slowly dismantled. It sold its 51% stake in Godrej Sara Lee to Godrej Consumer Products, and its air freshner brand Ambi Pur to Procter & Gamble, and household businesses to Unilever.
