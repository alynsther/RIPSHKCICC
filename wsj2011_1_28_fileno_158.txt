NEW DELHIâ€“Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Friday posted a better-than-expected jump in quarterly net profit after the state-run explorer got back the contributions it made several years ago to subsidize gas sales to some key industrial sectors. 

Net profit in the three months ended Dec. 31 rose to 70.83 billion rupees from 30.54 billion rupees a year earlier, exceeding the average estimate of 53.16 billion rupees in a Dow Jones Newswires poll of 11 analysts. 

Sales grew more than 21% to 185.86 billion rupees from 152.98 billion rupees a year earlier as India's largest oil producer by output benefited from higher crude oil prices and the government's decision to increase local gas prices. 

Oil and gas explorers across the world are expected to report higher profits for the October-December period as crude prices have surged on the back of a revival in global demand. 

Higher earnings will allow ONGC to invest in developing oil and gas assets in India or acquire them overseas as it attempts to meet the energy demands of one of the world's fastest growing economies. The company Thursday said it discovered shale gas at a pilot project in eastern India. 

The results will also boost investor confidence and raise the company's valuations ahead of the government's plan to sell a 5% stake in the explorer to raise funds for its social welfare and infrastructure projects. The government currently holds 74.14% of ONGC. 

ONGC booked a one-time gain of 18.98 billion rupees in the latest quarter as the government refunded the company's contribution to a gas pool account, which has now been dissolved. 

The gas pool account was created in the 1990s for selling gas at subsidized prices to key industrial sectors and regions. 

ONGC produced 7.027 million tons of crude oil in the three months through December, up from 6.599 million tons a year earlier. Natural gas production fell to 6.353 billion cubic meters from 6.459 billion cubic meters due to depleting reserves at its ageing fields. 

ONGC gave discounts of 42.22 billion rupees to fuel retailers in the October-December quarter, compared with 34.97 billion rupees a year earlier. 

India's state-run explorers have to give discounts on crude sales to state-run oil refining and marketing companies to help them partly offset losses on selling fuels at government-mandated discounted prices. 

After the discounts to fuel retailers, ONGC's quarterly earnings rose to $64.79 a barrel on crude sales from $57.69 a barrel. 

ONGC, which produced 24.86 million tons of crude oil in the year ended March 31, 2010, expects production to rise to more than 28 million tons by the financial year through March 2013. 

Gas output, which stood at 63 million metric standard cubic meters a day in the year ended March 2010, is expected to rise to 72 MMSCMD by March 2013 and 100 MMSCMD by March 2017 as the company brings new fields into production. 

ONGC shares closed up 1.9% at 1,135.60 rupees on the Bombay Stock Exchange, outperforming the benchmark Sensitive Index, which closed down 1.5%.
