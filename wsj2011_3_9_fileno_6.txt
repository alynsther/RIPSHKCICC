Former National Public Radio executive Ron Schiller ceded his new role at the Aspen Institute after a video scandal forced him to resign with immediate effect from NPR this week.

"Ron Schiller has informed us that, in light of the controversy surrounding his recent statements, he does not feel that it's in the best interests of the Aspen Institute for him to come work here," the Aspen Institute said in a statement Wednesday.

Mr. Schiller said last week that he would soon leave NPR for a job at the Aspen Institute, a nonprofit policy and research organization. But on Tuesday night, he released a statement saying that he and NPR had agreed to make the resignation effective immediately after he was caught on video making disparaging remarks about the Republican Party and the tea-party movement.

The video also forced the resignation of NPR CEO Vivian Schiller (no relation to Ron Schiller) on Wednesday morning.
