LONDON—European stocks finished in the black as upbeat U.S. economic data offset a statement by the head of the European Central Bank that an interest-rate increase next month "is possible." 

On Thursday, the central bank left interest rates on hold at 1%, but the euro spiked versus the dollar after ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet made clear his willingness to raise rates to counter inflation. 

"The ECB is ready to take a first pre-emptive strike against inflation and possible second-round effects next month," said  Carsten Brzeski, economist at ING Bank. "Only a new banking crisis or further surging oil prices could probably throw a monkey wrench in the ECB's plans. The ECB's hawkishness of recent weeks was no bluff. Barking dogs will bite."

The Stoxx Europe 600 index ended up 0.3% at 283.58, off its high for the day of 285.80. 

The U.K.'s FTSE 100 increased 1.5% to 6005.09, closing above the 6000 mark for the first time this week. Germany's DAX gained 0.6% to 7225.96 and France's CAC-40 closed 0.7% higher at 4060.76. 

By the close of European equity markets, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.4%, but Saudia Arabia's benchmark Tadawul All-Share Index closed down 3.9%, leading Middle Eastern markets broadly lower. 

U.S. claims for initial unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell Thursday, dropping by 20,000 to 368,000, its lowest level since May 2008. This bodes well for U.S. nonfarm payrolls data, due on Friday. 

That report coupled with Mr. Trichet's comments a lack of alarming new headlines from Libya and the rest of the oil-producing Middle Eastern and North African region sent U.S. Treasurys lower. In midday trading, the benchmark 10-year note was down 24/32 to yield 3.559%. 

The euro surged higher as investors factored in the idea that rates in the euro zone are almost certain to rise faster in the U.S. "Trichet has lent the euro some rocket fuel," said  Kathleen Brooks, research director at Forex.com.

Shortly after European markets closed, the euro was at $1.3947, compared with $1.3867 late in New York on Wednesday. The dollar was at 82.37 yen, compared with 81.89 yen.

 Elsewhere, light, sweet, crude for April delivery fell, but remained above the $100, on reports Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi was set to accept a plan for peaceful resolution to the conflict in the country. By the close of European equity markets, crude for April delivery was down $0.70 or 0.7% at $101.53 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 

Gold for April delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange was down $15.10 per ounce or 1.1% to $1422.60. Profit-taking was also in play here. 

In major market action: Alcatel-Lucent jumped 6.4% in Paris amid market speculation about a possible bid for the firm from a Chinese company. A spokeswoman declined comment. In addition, Barclays Capital raised its target price, saying the firm is "the best positioned of a challenged group of companies in the telecom infrastructure segment."

In London, British Sky Broadcasting Group climbed 3% as the U.K. government gave  News Corp. the green light to buy the 61% of BSkyB it doesn't already own, on the condition that it spins off the satellite broadcaster's news channel. News Corp. holds a 39.1% stake in BSkyB and owns Dow Jones & Co. and The Wall Street Journal.
