It was raw young power versus Tiger Woods in the featured threesome Thursday and Friday at the Arnold Palmer Invitational in Orlando, Fla. Sure enough, bombers Dustin Johnson and last week's Tour winner Gary Woodland outdrove Woods by 25 to 30 yards. But Woods rose to near the top of the field with a four-under-par 68 Friday while Johnson and Woodland missed the cut, with seven-over and nine-over totals.

"It's ridiculous," Hall of Famer Lanny Wadkins told Golfweek.
