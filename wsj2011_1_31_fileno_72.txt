The Green Bay Packers' James Starks is on his way to becoming the next Timmy Smith, a rookie running back who comes from out of nowhere in the postseason. Mr. Starks can only hope that the career similarities end there.

With just 38 rushing yards in the Super Bowl, Mr. Starks would become the second NFL player ever, after Mr. Smith, to rush for 200 yards more during the postseason than he did during the same regular season. As a rookie with the 1987 Washington Redskins, Mr. Smith shocked the world with a 204-yard rushing performance in Super Bowl XXII. But Mr Smith was out of the league two seasons later and spent two years in prison on a cocaine-distribution conviction in 2006.

Mr. Starks, a sixth-round draft pick in 2010, had injury woes at the start of the season and struggled to crack the Packers' lineup despite the team's run-game struggles after Ryan Grant got hurt. But Mr. Starks broke out in the team's playoff opener, rushing for 123 yards against the Eagles, and then he wore down the Falcons and Bears with 140 combined rushing yards.

The Super Bowl has featured some unexpected rushing stars, and Mr. Starks could be the next in line. But none of the players on this list ever went on to greatness. Neither Mr. Smith nor the other three runners on the list ever ran for more than 470 yards in any subsequent season.
