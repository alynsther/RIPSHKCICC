President Obama has effectively used the weeks since the midterm election to starve his critics within the Democratic Party of oxygen.

A new CNN poll finds that while Mr. Obama's agreement to extend the Bush tax cuts caused his approval rating among liberals to fall seven points, to 72%, he remains in a strong position with his party's base. "Among liberal Democrats, 85 percent say they want to see the party re-nominate Obama in 2012," says CNN polling director Keating Holland.

Compare that with Bill Clinton's political position after his horrible 1994 midterm election when only 63% of party liberals wanted to renominate him. Unlike Mr. Clinton, Mr. Obama deftly used Congress' lame-duck session to push through a repeal of the military's "don't ask, don't tell policy," scoring many points with his party's base.

His strong position with party liberals gives Mr. Obama room to co-opt Republicans on issues where he is vulnerable, such as government spending and deficits. Look for him to use his upcoming State of the Union address to try to preempt the debate over raising the debt ceiling by proposing Social Security reform or cosmetic limits to the growth of spending.

Liberals will grumble, but they know that Mr. Obama is now unlikely to be challenged by a serious candidate for his party's nomination. Mr. Obama may have lost his touch with many independent voters, but he has shown himself to be a master at defanging challenges to him from the left.
