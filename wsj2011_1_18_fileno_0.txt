MUMBAI -- Hindustan Construction Co. Ltd. said Tuesday it has received a copy of the environment ministry's report on the Lavasa hill city project being built by its unit Lavasa Corp.

"We are still studying the report, I don't have an immediate comment to offer,"  Jimmy Mogal, a spokesperson for HCC, said.

The Lavasa project near Pune in western India has come under fire, with the Ministry of Environment on Nov. 25 asking the company to stop work at the site, citing environmental violations. Lavasa subsequently challenged the stop-work order at the Bombay High Court.

The court asked the ministry to submit its report on environmental violations and proposed action it intends to take by Jan. 17.

Citing unnamed sources, local business channel NDTV Monday reported that the environment ministry's report said Lavasa's project was illegal and recommended a huge penalty.

NDTV also said the ministry has requested that no further construction is allowed at Lavasa until the court delivers its judgement on the case.
