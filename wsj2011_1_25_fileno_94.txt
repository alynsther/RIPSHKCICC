BRASILIA--Brazil' current account deficit soared in 2010 to $47.5 billion, underscoring recent worries about rising imports, a rapidly strengthening currency and it impact on the country's foreign commerce. 

After years of steady growth, Brazilians are consuming more imports and travelling abroad with increased frequency, while local companies continue to send profits overseas to take advantage of the increased purchasing power of the domestic currency. 

The deficit, which nearly doubled the deficit reported in 2009, was equivalent to 2.28% of gross domestic product in 2010, up from 1.52% in 2010, the central bank said Tuesday. 

The figure was the highest on record since 2001. 

The deficit was fully financed by foreign direct investment, however, rising to $48.5 billion in 2010 from $25.9 billion the previous year. 

"The worsening of the deficit in 2010 was due to the impact of growing income, services and the trade balance," said central bank economics department coordinator  Altamir Lopes. 

According to central bank data released Tuesday, the large deficit in 2010 came in the wake of a dwindling trade surplus, increased overseas profit remittances by companies operating locally, and greater foreign travel by Brazilians. 

Brazil's trade surplus narrowed to $20.67 billion during the year from $25.29 billion in 2009, under the weight of diminishing exports and rising imports prompted by an appreciating local currency. Brazil's currency, the real, has gained about 30% against the dollar since early 2009. 

Companies operating locally have taken advantage of the stronger real, sending growing volumes of local profits back overseas at an advantageous exchange rate. 

Overseas profit and dividend remittances rose to $30.37 billion in 2010 from $25.22 billion in 2009, the central bank reported. 

"We've seen more profitability from companies locally, and with the global picture, local affiliates have worked to assist their headquarters abroad," said Mr. Lopes. 

At the same time, Brazilian consumers have sought out more and more travel bargains abroad. Brazil's deficit in foreign travel services widened to a record $10.5 billion last year from around $5 billion in 2009. 

Meanwhile, foreign direct investment continued to aid the local outlook in December, rising to $15.36 billion from $3.73 billion the previous month. The figure was lifted especially during the month by a $7.1 billion transaction in the oil sector involving the Chinese group Sinopec and Repsol Brasil. 

Mr. Lopes said he expected annual foreign direct investment to continue growing in 2011 to $45 billion.

But the growing direct investment will be well needed to finance a continued gap in the country's current account deficit, which the central bank is projecting will widen further in 2011 to $64 billion, or the equivalent of 2.84% of GDP. 

Alongside current account and foreign direct investment figures, the central bank Tuesday also released 2010 results for the country's foreign debt. According to the latest estimate, Brazil's foreign debt rose to $255.7 billion in December from $198.2 billion in 2009, due to increasing corporate financing abroad.
