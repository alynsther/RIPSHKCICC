He's only five at-bats into the spring, but it's already obvious that something is slightly off with Derek Jeter, and that the adjustment he's making to his swing may take some time to become second nature. Hitting coach Kevin Long said that he will work on the swing with Jeter Tuesday, and that the shortstop may need extra sessions all through the spring to get it right. 

"It's something he's trying to change after 16, 17 years of doing it one way—yeah, I can tell he's not comfortable," Long said. 

Jeter acknowledged that the change—removing the stride from his swing—is probably going to take a while to adopt. "That was the first time I've seen pitching with it. It's going to take a while to get comfortable," Jeter said.

Yankee ace CC Sabathia tested his surgically repaired knee Monday for the first time since he went under the knife this winter, and he passed with flying colors. 

"It felt great. No problems, ran afterwards, no problems," Sabathia said.

Sabathia had a meniscal tear in his right knee repaired this winter. He didn't expect it to hinder him but said it was comforting to know he could cut it loose in a game and feel no pain. Sabathia pitched two scoreless innings against the Detroit Tigers on Monday in New York's 6-2 loss.
