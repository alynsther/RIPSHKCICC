Around 1 a.m. Monday morning, chants of "USA! USA!" echoed from the kitchen in the visiting clubhouse at Citizens Bank Park. But it wasn't entirely a show of patriotism. Mets players were cheering for bullpen catcher Dave Racaniello, who had just finished his 14th cheese steak of the weekend. That set a record for the visiting clubhouse in Philadelphia, players said. The previous mark was held by former big-league slugger Dmitri Young.
