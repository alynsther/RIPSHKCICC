 on Tuesday said it has sold its 45% stake in fashion label  Jean-Paul Gaultier for €16 million to Spain's Grupo Puig, which will become the majority shareholder in the business. 

The proceeds from the sale, together with the repayment of €14 million worth of granted loans, will generate an accounting profit of €30 million for Hermès, the company said. 

Jean-Paul Gaultier owned 55% of the fashion house, which he founded in 1976. According to published reports, Gaultier was expected to cede 10% of his stake to Puig, a family-owned perfume maker that owns the Nina Ricci, Paco Rabanne and Carolina Herrera luxury brands. 

Spokeswomen for the Gaultier label and Puig confirmed that the Spanish company will take control of the fashion label but didn't provide details on the amount of shares Mr. Gaultier is relinquishing to Puig. 

Mr. Gaultier will continue to take responsibility for the creative activities and image of the fashion house, which has a haute-couture business as well as perfume, licensed to Beaute Prestige International, a subsidiary of Japan-based  Shiseido Co.
