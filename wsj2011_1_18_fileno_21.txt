Demand for U.S. workers who speak foreign languages—especially Spanish and Chinese—should continue to grow over the next decade, but very few workers plan to study them, according to a newly released study by the University of Phoenix Research Institute.

The institute surveyed 511 workers and 419 employers last fall. Workers were asked what skills or degrees they already had or were planning to acquire; employers were asked what skills were in demand or would be in demand in 10 years.

The result: 42% of employers expect business proficiency in Chinese to be in moderate or high demand in a decade; nearly 70% expect Spanish to be in demand.

Meanwhile, more than 80% of workers said it was somewhat or highly unlikely that they'd become proficient to conduct business in Chinese in the next 10 years, and nearly 60% said they'd probably not learn Spanish.

"It's alarming. Current proficiencies in these languages is already low," said  Leslie Miller, executive director of the Institute.

Employees entering the work force in the next decade might be better prepared. According to the Modern Language Association, a professional association for scholars, college enrollment in Chinese grew more than 18% between fall 2006 and fall 2009 to about 61,000 students, while Spanish enrollment grew 5% to about 865,000.

Already, employers place a premium on bilingual job candidates, especially those who know non-Romance languages like Chinese and Russian, said  Beth Ross, an executive coach in New York City. "It can be a goldmine. It's easier to find them jobs and they often get paid more," said Ms. Ross.
