BEIJING—Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said the government will continue to expand the flexibility of the yuan's exchange rate, but said any change needs to be measured because of its potentially broad economic impact.

Speaking at a news conference early Monday in Beijing, Mr. Wen put much of the blame for China's high inflation on international factors, in particular "some countries" that have implemented quantitative easing policies—a remark aimed largely at the U.S.—"creating large-scale fluctuations" in global exchange rates and prices of goods.

Mr. Wen reiterated that China will prioritize the fight against inflation this year. But when asked if its response would include a more rapid appreciation of the yuan, he stressed gradualism.

"We will further increase the flexibility of the [yuan] in accordance with market demand," Mr. Wen told reporters at the close of China's annual legislative session. "But at the same time we must keep in mind that this kind of appreciation is gradual, because it relates to employment and to what companies can bear. We must maintain social stability."

China has let the yuan gain only about 4% against the dollar since depegging the Chinese currency in June. Many economists say a faster rise would help curb inflation but reducing the prices of imported goods in yuan terms.
