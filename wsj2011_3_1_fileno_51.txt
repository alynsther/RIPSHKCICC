The Environmental Protection Agency is suspending its PCB inspections of public schools in the wake of the city's announced plan to remove light fixtures suspected of leaking the toxic chemicals.

Last week, the city announced a 10-year, $708 million plan to remove aging fluorescent light fixtures suspected of leaking PCBs, a type of chemical used widely in construction materials starting in the 1950s but which were banned in 1978 and labeled a probable carcinogen.

  Mary Mears, a spokeswoman for the EPA regional office in New York, said the agency doesn't have any more inspections planned in the near future, but "we always reserve our rights to inspect.''

The agency began conducting its own spot inspections in January, after they failed to convince the Bloomberg administration to immediately begin a program for removing the suspect lights. 

On Monday, the agency released results from an inspection of P.S. 306 in Brooklyn, where 25 of the 31 samples taken were above the regulatory limit for PCB removal.
