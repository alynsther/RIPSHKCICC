LONDON—Mining stocks posted steep losses, pulling down European shares, as worries over global growth led investors to cut their exposure to riskier assets.

Commodity prices tumbled; silver slumped nearly 8% before retracing some of the losses. China's decision to increase its reserve requirements for banks yet again as a way to cool lending and its economy added to concerns that demand for commodities could weaken. Additionally, the International Energy Agency cut its forecast for daily oil-demand growth in 2011. 

The Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell 0.7% to close at 281.80. U.S. stocks, which started the day in the red, were narrowly mixed as European trading ended. The euro edged higher against the dollar.

Still, caution remained overall as investors noted ongoing worries about the situation in Greece and other indebted euro-zone countries, which are unlikely to subside anytime soon. "There should be no expectation of an early decision on extra funds for Greece at the May 16 Ecofin, as the discussions seem likely to stretch well into June," said analysts at Lloyds Bank Corporate Market.

Among major national European benchmarks, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 index fell 0.5% to 5944.96, France's CAC-40 index ended down 0.9% at 4023.29, and Germany's DAX fell 0.7% to 7443.95. 

The euro rose to $1.4226 midday in New York, from $1.4201 late Wednesday. Asian stock markets fell, dragged by a sharp drop on Wall Street Wednesday.

"A lot of speculative money went into commodities and that went on for a long time," said  Philippe Gijsels, head of research at BNP Paribas Fortis Global Markets.

Since commodities started to turn lower at the end of April — in part due to worries over European growth helping to lift the dollar — the "hot money" has started to pour out of the sector, though he said there could still be more losses to come.

"I've got a feeling that there's still quite a lot of speculative money in this space," he said.

The fall in commodity prices also weighed on oil companies. French oil major  Total dropped 1.4%, even as crude for June delivery on Nymex was just modestly lower.  Deutsche Lufthansa
