NEW DELHI -- Jindal Steel & Power hasn't yet decided on a date for a planned initial public offering of its power-generation unit despite the looming deadline of May 27.

The current approval for a public issue from the Securities and Exchange Board of India for Jindal Power expires on that day,

The company, in its prospectus, has said it would raise up to 72 billion rupees ($1.6 billion), a senior company executive said Friday.

"Our company had never committed any particular date for the [unit's] IPO," said Sushil Maroo, the company's finance director. "So, whenever the board decides, we will go ahead with the public offer."

He also said that difficulty in securing coal supply hasn't been a concern for the unit's power projects. The company's two major projects -- adding 2,400 megawatt capacity to its 1,000 MW power plant in central India and building a new 1,980 MW plant in eastern India -- have largely secured coal supply.

Meanwhile, Mr. Maroo also said the company's open offer to buy all outstanding shares in Australian coal mining firm Rocklands Richfield is ongoing.

"It's too early to comment on the result of the open offer," he said.

On Wednesday, the Rocklands board told shareholders to reject the Jindal bid, saying it undervalues the company and brings no strategic vision for growth. 

The offer of 25 Australian cents for every Rocklands share values the company at A$88 million ($93 million). At present, Jindal Steel holds a 14.46% interest in Rocklands.

Mr. Maroo said the company's steel plant in Oman, which it acquired last year, would start contributing to its revenue and profit in the financial year that began April 1. 

"We expect growth in both steel and power businesses to be impressive this fiscal year," he said.
