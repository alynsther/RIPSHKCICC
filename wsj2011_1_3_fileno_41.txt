 and  Toyota Motor Corp. posted robust vehicle-sales growth for 2010, thanks to the launch of new models and strong consumer demand.

Ford India Pvt. Ltd. nearly tripled its sales from a year earlier to 83,887 vehicles last year, while General Motors India said its sales rose 59% to 110,804 vehicles. Toyota Kirloskar Motor Pvt. Ltd. posted a 38% rise to 74,759 autos.

The three companies announced their sales numbers in separate statements over the weekend.

A rise in disposable-income levels, demand for personal mobility and aggressive expansion by Indian as well as global auto makers ensured strong sales-growth figures in 2010.

Saturday, the country's biggest auto maker by revenue,  Tata Motors Ltd., said it sold 566,933 vehicles between April and December, up 31% from a year earlier. The country's biggest sport-utility-vehicle maker by sales, Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd., said it sold 269,445 vehicles in the same period, up 29%.

The Indian unit of U.S.-based Ford said it has sold more than 60,000 of its Figo small cars since the model's launch in March. GM attributed its sales growth primarily to two small cars, the Chevrolet Beat and the Chevrolet Spark, as well as the U.S. company's Cruze sedan.

Toyota, which introduced its Etios sedan last month, said it has already despatched the first 400 of the cars to its customers. The Japanese company aims to launch its Liva small car in April.
