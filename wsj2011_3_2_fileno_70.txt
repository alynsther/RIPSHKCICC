New York Times columnist  Frank Rich is leaving the newspaper to join New York magazine as an essayist, ending a three-decade career at the paper.

Mr. Rich, who has been an op-ed columnist since 1994, will write a monthly essay on politics and culture that will anchor a special section he will oversee as editor at large.

The hiring of Mr. Rich adds an influential voice in political journalism to the weekly magazine and reunites him with New York Editor in Chief  Adam Moss, who previously was editor of the New York Times Magazine and oversaw the paper's culture and style coverage, among other roles.

Mr. Rich, 61 years old, joined New York Times Co. in 1980 and served as its chief drama critic until 1993. During his stint on the op-ed page, he wrote a column for the Sunday Arts & Leisure section, served as senior adviser to the Times's culture editor and was a senior writer for the Times magazine. 

Mr. Moss said he has been trying to recruit Mr. Rich since he took the helm at New York.

Mr. Rich said that his new role will allow him to write with "more reflection, variety and space than is possible within the confines of a weekly newspaper column." He will start the job at New York in June.

Under the direction of Mr. Moss, New York has won 15 National Magazine Awards over the last five years, including three for general excellence in print.

Mr. Rich's last column in the Times will appear on March 13, the Times's editorial-page editor,  Andrew Rosenthal, wrote in an internal memo. "I know I speak for everyone at the Times when I say that we are very sorry to see him leave," Mr. Rosenthal wrote.

Separately, the Times said  Joe Nocera, a business columnist for the Times for the past six years, will become an op-ed columnist for the paper starting in April. His column will appear twice a week and cover business and financial-policy matters.
