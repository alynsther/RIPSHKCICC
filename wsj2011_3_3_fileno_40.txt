HONG KONGâ€”China Forestry Holdings Co. said Wednesday former Chief Executive  Li Hanchun was detained by police in China's Guizhou province last week on suspicions he embezzled 30 million yuan ($4.6 million). 

Mr. Li's detention came days after he was stripped of his duties at the Hong Kong-listed logging company. In early February, the city's securities regulator sought a court order to freeze Mr. Li's assets after he sold a stake in the company two weeks before China Forestry halted trading in its shares and disclosed possible accounting irregularities. 

China Forestry, which is backed by private equity firm Carlyle Group LLC, said in a statement Wednesday that Mr. Li had taken the sales documents of some of the company's units and that the company is seeking legal advice on how to recover the documents. 

China Forestry said it set up an independent board committee to investigate its financial and operational situation, and it believes it has sufficient financial resources to cover its operational expenses and pay off liabilities. 

As of Friday, the company had around 2.38 billion yuan in cash and bank deposits in Hong Kong and China, China Forestry said. 

Trading in China Forestry's shares, which was halted Jan. 26, will remain suspended, it said. Mr. Li couldn't be reached for comment.
