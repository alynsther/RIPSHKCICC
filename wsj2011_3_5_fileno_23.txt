China's premier called for strengthening the military to build a "powerful people's army" that can fight under modern conditions, as the country's return to double-digit growth in defense spending prompted concern from some foreign governments and analysts.‬

The government will work to "constantly enhance [the military's] capability to accomplish a range of military tasks, the most paramount of which is winning local wars under information age conditions," Premier Wen Jiabao said in his annual report Saturday to kick off the annual session of the National People's Congress, China's legislature.‬

His comments came a day after China disclosed plans to increase its defense budget by 13% this year, amid trepidation in the region about China's escalating might after a week of fresh Chinese territorial confrontations with Japan, South Korea, Vietnam and the Philippines.‬

Concerns that China will use its escalating military power to assert its territorial claims in the region have prompted many of its neighbors to shore up defense ties with the U.S. and beef up their own militaries, threatening to push Asia into a new arms race.‬

Responding to Friday's defense budget announcement, Japan Foreign Minister Seiji Maehara urged the Chinese government to be more transparent about how it planned to use its newfound military firepower, saying, "Whether it should be regarded as offensive or defensive would require a close look." (Mr. Maehara resigned Sunday over an unrelated matter.)‬

China expects to spend 601.1 billion yuan ($91.4 billion) on defense in 2011, up from 533.4 billion yuan last year, said Li Zhaoxing, spokesman for the National People's Congress, ahead of the start of the legislature's annual session on Saturday. The projected rise is faster than last year's 7.5% increase—the slowest clip in decades—but is significantly slower than the roughly 19% annual growth in years before 2010.‬

‪But the number doesn't include key items such as the program to develop a stealth fighter and an aircraft carrier, according to foreign military experts who estimate that China's real defense spending is far higher.‬

Mr. Li said the military budget is relatively low as a proportion of China's GDP and dismissed concerns that it threatened neighboring countries.‬

Bonnie Glaser, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the newly announced spending levels are a return to Beijing's spending levels of recent years. "The military has, in general, a growing voice," she said. "We have seen a lot of evidence of [China] exerting greater influence."‬

Navy Commander Leslie Hull-Ryde, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said China's spending was helping Beijing build a "modern force capable of conducting a growing range of military operations." She said the U.S. is continuing to ask China to be "more transparent regarding the capabilities it is acquiring."‬

On Wednesday, Japan scrambled fighter jets to chase off two Chinese military planes that it said flew within 34 miles of disputed islands in the East China Sea, which are known as Senkaku in Japan and as Diaoyu in China. Japanese government spokesman Yukio Edano said Japan wouldn't protest formally as the Chinese planes did not leave international airspace, but voiced concern over China's growing military power and said Japan would monitor the situation. China's Foreign Ministry didn't respond to a request to comment.‬

China-Japan relations plunged to their lowest point in years in September following collisions near the islands between two Japanese coast guard patrol boats and a Chinese fishing vessel. In December, Japan—which in 2010 was surpassed by China as the world's No. 2 economy —revised its national defense guidelines, which were drawn up during the Cold War, to shift focus away from Russia and toward the emerging threat from China.‬

Also on Wednesday, the Philippines deployed two warplanes to protect oil explorers who complained that they were being harassed by two Chinese patrol boats in a disputed area of the South China Sea.‬‪

The Philippine government demanded an explanation Friday for the incident near the Spratly Islands, which are claimed by China, Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan, Vietnam and the Philippines. A Chinese Embassy spokesman reiterated China's claim to the Spratly Islands and adjacent waters, but said Beijing is committed to maintaining peace and stability in the area, according to the Associated Press.‬ ‪

On Thursday, Vietnam's Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it had lodged a protest with the Chinese embassy after China's navy conducted antipiracy drills around the Spratlys a week earlier. Vietnam said the drills were a violation of its sovereignty.‬

‪South Korea's Coast Guard said Friday it seized two Chinese fishing boats and their crews on Thursday after they were found fishing illegally in South Korea's Exclusive Economic Zone, 64 miles southwest of Keokrulbiyeol island in the west sea.‬ ‪

China's Foreign Ministry didn't respond to a request to comment on that incident, or the protest from Vietnam.‬
