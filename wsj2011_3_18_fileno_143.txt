 'Three Men on a Horse,' Thursday, Theatre Row's Beckett Theatre, New York 

At the start of this production, actors hand out betting slips to the audience before multicolored horses on sticks race across the stage. In the 1935 screwball comedy by John Cecil Holm and George Abbott, a greeting-card writer with a talent for picking winners falls in with a desperate group of gamblers. The production by TACT/The Actors Company Theatre has other twists for fans of the ponies: the races are voiced by longtime track announcer Dave Johnson. And that race that kicks off the opening of the play? The winner gets a prize at intermission. 

 'Live Wire,' Tuesday 

Harlan Coben's Myron Bolitar is a Jewish, 6-foot-4, 220-pound former basketball player turned sports agent who drinks Yoo-Hoos and solves murders in his spare time. Mr. Coben—whose thrillers have 47 million copies in print—has written 10 novels about him. In his latest, he introduces Myron's 16-year-old nephew, Mickey, who will return this fall as the star of "Shelter," the first novel in a young-adult series. Mr. Coben said he was nervous about how his four kids, ages 9 to 16, would react to his new character. "I'm Dad, so everything I do is uncool," he said. "But it was a tremendous thumbs-up."

 'Triangle: Remembering the Fire,' HBO, Monday, 9 p.m. 

A new HBO documentary commemorates the 100th anniversary of one of the worst workplace disasters in U.S. history, which killed 146 people. Mostly young immigrant Jewish women died when a fire broke out on March 25, 1911, at the Triangle Waist Company. The film features descendents of victims and never-before-seen footage, but mostly the film uses the catastrophe as a jumping-off point to talk about how the fire contributed to the growth of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union and led to reforms in laws governing working conditions in factories.
