 Suki Cheema  Brooklyn, N.Y.

 WHAT: As one of Diane von Furstenberg's textile designers, Mr. Cheema clearly knows his way around a bold print. So when the 36-year-old Briton launched an eponymous home collection last year, the design world took note. 

His bright, geometric, hand-silkscreened throws, pillows, napkins, quilts and rugs are inspired by his travels in India, Peru and elsewhere. 

 WHY: Mr. Cheema was raised outside of London, in Kent, where his parents had a clothing factory.

My dad would lay the denim on these massive tables, and then cut the jean patterns out," he says.

There'd be rolls and rolls of fabric underneath the table that I would just sit and play with. So I literally grew up playing with fabric."

 HOW: After graduating from Central Saint Martins in London, he came to New York and freelanced as a print designer for Calvin Klein, Donna Karan and Ralph Lauren.

In 2002, he dropped his resume off at Diane von Furstenberg and was offered a job.

Seven years later he began working on ideas for his own home line. Now he works three days for DVF and four days for himself.

 WHERE: Barneys, Bergdorf Goodman and The Future Perfect. 

 AND: What Ms. von Furstenberg has taught him: "Diane is very particular about color. One time, she spilled beet juice and wiped it up with a paper towel.

She brought in the dried-up towel and said, 'This is the color that I want.' It was as simple as that. 

Now when I walk down the street, if I see a color blue that I like, or a coffee cup that's a nice shade of yellow, I'll take a picture. I always go back to these photos and use them when I'm developing my color palettes.
