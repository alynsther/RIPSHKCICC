Cute is out; serious Japanese contemporary art is in. That's the message of an exhibit at New York's Japan Society called "Bye Bye Kitty: Between Heaven and Hell in Contemporary Japanese Art," which begins next Friday and runs through June 12. The Society promises that works by 16 emerging and midcareer artists will confront conventional stereotypes and "demolish our preconceptions about contemporary Japan and its art." One highlight: a huge painting called Ash Color Mountains by Makoto Aida, depicting on an epic scale three piles of dead salarymen piled on top of their desks and office equipment. 

Kumi Machida's eerie painting above, titled "Visitor," reflects her training in Nihonga, traditional techniques developed in the late 19th century and usually applied to landscapes, birds and flowers. She's taken the techniques—which include careful preparation of the surface and meticulous brush control—and "put them to a much less traditional use," says Joe Earle, director of the Japan Society Gallery.
