DETROITâ€”Detroit's Hotel Pontchartrain is heading for foreclosure after a Florida judge dismissed a bankruptcy proceeding dashing any hopes for a quick reopening of the iconic property located steps away from the city's convention center. 

The United Central Bank, owed millions by the hotel's former owner Shubh Hotels LLC, will likely foreclose on the property sometime in February, said the bank's attorney  Michael Popok. Barring an unexpected sale, the hotel will sit in limbo for six months until the title is transferred back to the bank. Mr. Popok said the bank wants to find a buyer as quick as possible. 

Shubh, which acquired the hotel in 2006 and spent $35 million in renovations, attempted to stay in control of the hotel but failed to come up with the needed financial resources. The company had looked to secure as much as $5 million more in loans so it could reopen the hotel in March. The hotel has been closed for about 18 months. 

"Potentially it could be a great buy for somebody," said Shubh's attorney  Susan Lasky who said assessors have pegged the property's value at $2 million. "Where else can you buy a 25-story hotel across from a convention center for $2 million?"
