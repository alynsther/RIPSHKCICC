Preston Knowles scored 25 points, Kyle Kuric added 20 and No. 19 Louisville continued its torrid shooting in an easy victory over St. John's on Wednesday night in Kentucky.

Paris Horne led St. John's with 13 points, but the Red Storm turned it over a season-high 25 times and couldn't keep up when Louisville pushed the pace.

The Cardinals shot 53 percent from the field and made 12 threes.
