MUMBAI â€“ Adani Enterprises Ltd. Thursday posted a surge in fourth-quarter consolidated net profit, helped by expansion in its coal trading, power generation and ports businesses. 

Profit for January-March more than doubled to 9.28 billion rupees ($208 million) from 3.40 billion rupees a year earlier. 

Consolidated sales rose 16% to 91.00 billion rupees from 78.24 billion rupees.

Income from other sources fell to 83.2 million rupees from 1.05 billion rupees while Adani Enterprises' tax expenses climbed to 2.33 billion rupees from 161.8 million rupees. 

The company, part of the diversified Adani group, said the trading volume for coal in the fourth quarter grew 20% to 12 million tons. Volume was 33.47 million tons for the full year. 

"We're looking at [imports of] something in the region of 40 million tons with a robust 25% plus growth [this fiscal year]," Chief Financial Officer  Devang Desai said. 

"We're the largest importer of coal in the country with a 50% market share," he added. 

He said 70% of the imports will be from Indonesia, a large portion of the rest from South Africa, with some lots from other regions, including Columbia. 

Meanwhile, Adani Enterprises' power business, under unit Adani Power Ltd., generated about 2.7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity in the fourth quarter and about 6.7 billion kWh in the full year. 

It currently has 1,980 megawatts of power generating capacity and is implementing 18,500 MW of power projects with an aim to touch 20,000 MW capacity by 2020. 

Mr. Desai said Adani Enterprises' ports operations under its unit Mundra Port & Special Economic Zone Ltd. handled 14 million tons of cargo in the quarter and about 54 million tons during the year. 

It operates a 60 million ton coal import terminal, expandable up to 100 million tons at the private port on India's western coast. 

The company expects to touch 85 million tons this fiscal year and expand this to 100 million tons of cargo by 2012-13. 

Mundra is also developing a 6 million ton coal import terminal at the Visakhapatnam port in southern India. 

Adani Enterprises has invested in several overseas assets including the Galilee Coal Tenement in Queensland, Australia, where it plans to invest A$6.9 billion to develop mines and A$1.8 billion in the Abbot Point coal terminal. 

It has been scouting for targets in South Africa as well. 

"Africa is an important sourcing base for us. We have a good relationship and that will become a focus area if we get something that makes sense for us economically and as part of the overall structure," Mr. Desai said.
