Maybe the Jets should consider letting Rashard Mendenhall break off a few nice runs this weekend. Their biggest problem in the AFC Championship Game may be playing too well against the Steelers' ground attack.

Pittsburgh has been adamant about establishing the run—calling a rushing play 49.6% of the time—even if it hasn't always been the greatest strategy. It finished 18th in the league in yards-per-rush this season and will have to deal with one of football's top run defenses Sunday evening. 

Statistically, the Steelers' greatest offensive weapon is the arm of quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, who averages more yards per pass attempt than the other two quarterbacks the Jets have faced in the postseason—Indianapolis's Peyton Manning and New England's Tom Brady.

A closer examination of the Steelers' running game shows that they enjoy the most success when they run around their left end. They averaged 6.27 yards per rush on those plays, which ranked 10th best in the league. Meanwhile, the Jets allowed 6.05 yards per carry around left end, which is 25th-best in the NFL. That said, the Steelers ran a league-low 22 plays in that direction, which may cloud the data. Pittsburgh prefers to run to the right, where the Jets have proven up to the challenge. 

Pittsburgh fans should hope the Jets live up to expectations and stop the run, forcing the Steelers to put the game on Mr. Roethlisberger's shoulder—literally.
