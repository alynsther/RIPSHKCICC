The United States Ski and Snowboard Association plans to sign a lucrative deal with outfitter The North Face that is expected to be announced Tuesday. The deal signals the continuing rise of freeskiing.

Seeing an opening for much-needed revenues to support its training and research, the USSA has created a new division to represent freeskiing exclusively, much the way it did for snowboarding. The North Face deal is said to be worth more than $6.5 million over the next eight years, according to people with knowledge of the details. The deal makes The North Face the official outfitter of U.S. freeskiers for the 2014 and 2018 Olympiads and will give the California-based company a presence at related events throughout the country.

"You talk to anyone in the ski industry, this is where all the scale and the growth is," said Andrew Judelson, chief marketing officer for the USSA. 

The North Face has long been a dominant brand for back-country adventure sports, but the company his eye on expanding into a trendy new category. It's also sponsoring the Winter X Games this year.

"We've been evolving from the back country into the front country in the past 10 years," said Aaron Carpenter, The North Face's vice president of marketing. "Action sports are a fast-growing part of our business."

Another factor in this deal: The 2014 Sochi Olympics could expand to include two new freeskiing events.

The International Olympic Committee may decide in April to add ski halfpipe and slope-style skiing and snowboarding, in which competitors do a series of jumps and acrobatics as they travel down a slope in a terrain park. These are some of the most popular competitions at the Winter X Games each year. The popularity of these skiing events is also making the event's skis, which have turned up tips on both ends, among the industry's most popular products.
