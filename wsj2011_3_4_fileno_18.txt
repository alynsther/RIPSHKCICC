MUMBAI â€“Indian shares gave up early gains to close flat Friday, weighed by continued tensions in the Middle East and as advances in auto and banking stocks were offset by a fall in Larsen & Toubro. 

The Bombay Stock Exchange's Sensitive Index snapped a four-day positive streak to close 3.31 points, or 0.02%, lower at 18486.45. 

On the National Stock Exchange, the 50-stock S&P CNX Nifty fell 2.55 points, or 0.05%, to end at 5538.75. 

Trading volume on the BSE fell to 31.58 billion rupees ($703.6 million) from Thursday's 38.21 billion. Gainers lagged decliners 1,390 to 1,484, while 126 stocks were unchanged. 

Analysts say the benchmark gave up gains late in the session following reports that Yemeni soldiers had killed two protesters and wounded at least nine others Friday, when they opened fire on an anti-regime rally in the northern province of Amran. 

"The post-budget sentiment is carrying us forward, but the macro-picture is not very bright. Rising oil prices and likely under-provisioning for oil and fertilizer subsidies in the [federal] budget are concerns," said  Jagdish Malkani, country head at TAIB Capital. 

The budget, announced Monday, proposed a cash subsidy of 200 billion rupees to state-run oil companies for selling fuels below cost and 500 billion rupees toward fertilizer subsidy for the next fiscal year. Analysts, however, say subsidies could be higher than estimated. 

Mr. Malkani expects mid-cap stocks, which he says haven't participated in the post-budget rally so far, to outperform large-cap shares in coming sessions. 

Of the 30 Sensex constituents, 13 ended higher Friday. 

Most banking shares rose on expectations liquidity conditions in the banking system will improve after the budget showed the government's net market borrowing for the fiscal year that starts April 1 is estimated at 3.43 trillion rupees, lower than the 3.96 trillion rupees forecast in a Dow Jones Newswires poll of 15 analysts. 

An analyst with a Mumbai-based brokerage said cabinet approval Thursday for a bill that seeks to give bank shareholders voting rights in proportion to their holding also boosted investor sentiment in the sector. 

  HDFC Bank rose 1.2% to 2,218.45 rupees while State Bank of India closed 0.4% higher at 2,700.2 rupees. 

Auto shares continued their good run even though analysts said the sector might not be able to maintain its sales growth rate in coming months. HDFC Securities expects the industry's monthly sales growth rate to fall to 10%-13% over the next couple of months from 20%-30% due to rising inventory levels at dealerships and falling customer sales in some regions. 

Still, Hero Honda Motors rose 2.2% to 1,534.45 rupees while Bajaj Auto closed 2% higher at 1,377.65 rupees. 

Among other Sensex gainers,  Infosys Technologies rose 1.2% to 3,062.9 rupees while Tata Power closed 2.3% higher at 1,218.7 rupees.

Sensex losses were led by capital goods shares as investors looked to take profit from recent gains. 

The BSE capital goods sub-index had gained 7.3% in the three sessions starting Monday on hopes that the federal budget's focus on infrastructure would translate into more orders for engineering companies. 

Larsen & Toubro fell 3.1% to 1,610.8 rupees while Bharat Heavy Electricals closed 1.9% lower at 2,085 rupees. 

Among other Sensex losers, Tata Consultancy Services shed 1.4% to 1,134.5 rupees while Bharti Airtel finished 1.2% lower at 326.75 rupees.
