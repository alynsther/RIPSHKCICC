"Art in the Streets," now at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, bills itself as the first major U.S. museum exhibition on street art. 

The show focuses on the 1970s and '80s, when graffiti both symbolized the downward spiral of New York City and entered the mainstream of the art world. 

It also includes more recent work by practitioners like Shepard Fairey, whose "HOPE" poster for candidate Barack Obama introduced him to a world-wide audience. 

The show has been controversial. After it opened last month, reports of graffiti near the museum rose, and critics accused the curators of glorifying vandalism. The exhibit runs through Aug. 8 and will travel next year to the Brooklyn Museum in New York.
