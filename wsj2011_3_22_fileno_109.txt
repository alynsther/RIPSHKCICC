ROMEâ€”The Italian government will approve Wednesday a one-year moratorium on the country's planned nuclear comeback, the industry minister said Tuesday as the global backlash against atomic energy means it faces overwhelming opposition in the country.

"Tomorrow the cabinet will declare a one-year moratorium on the decisions and start of procedures to select the sites of nuclear plants," Mr. Romani said on the sidelines of a parliamentary committee in Rome. 

Italy banned nuclear power in a 1987 referendum. The government of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi announced in 2008 it would allow the return of nuclear power in Italy.

In recent days Italian ministers had asked for a pause on the nuclear comeback following the accident at Japan's Fukushima Daiichi complex.
