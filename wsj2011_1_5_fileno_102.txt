Continuing their offseason quest to add pitching depth at wholesale prices, the Mets signed two pitchers this week, right-hander Taylor Buchholz (pictured above) and left-hander Chris Capuano. Both have recent and substantial injury histories: Mr. Capuano, 32, a National League All-Star in 2006, has had two Tommy John surgeries, and Mr. Buchholz, 29, missed the entire 2009 season because of elbow surgery.

In making the National League All-Star team in 2006, Mr. Capuano was 11-12 with a 4.06 earned-run average for the Milwaukee Brewers. The Mets designated reliever Ryota Igarashi for assignment to make room on their 40-man roster for Messrs. Capuano and Buchholz.

In sizing up the Jets, his team's opponent in Saturday's AFC wild-card game, Indianapolis quarterback Peyton Manning pointed out that the Colts won just one game against a playoff team this season. "We're facing a different animal this week," he said—but not too different. The Jets themselves won just two games against playoff teams this season—and lost four.

A day after surprisingly demoting 20-year-old defenseman Michael Del Zotto (pictured below) to the AHL, Rangers coach John Tortorella made it clear on Tuesday that the Blueshirts' franchise still revolves around youth. Top prospect Ryan McDonagh, 21, replaced Mr. Del Zotto and he could make his Rangers debut on Wednesday when they play the Carolina Hurricanes at 7 p.m. in the Garden. "I couldn't be happier as far as the youth on the team,'' Mr. Tortorella said. "Whether we make mistakes or not, this is where it's at for this organization, and I'm looking to bring more young guys if we can."
