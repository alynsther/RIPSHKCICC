NEW DELHI -- India's federal government currently has no plan to regulate gasoline prices, a senior official in the country's oil ministry said Wednesday.

"There is a provision that if prices go to astronomically high levels, the government may intervene, but as of now, there are no plans as such to regulate petrol prices,"  Sudhir Bhargava, additional secretary, told reporters.

The government in June lifted state control over gasoline prices and said diesel prices too will be market-driven in the future--but that hasn't happened yet.
