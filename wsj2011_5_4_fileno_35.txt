SEOUL—North Korea on Wednesday confirmed it has detained two Japanese men since March and would charge them with drug trafficking violations, creating another diplomatic problem with a country it regularly criticizes.

Last month, North Korea said it had detained an American citizen since November for an unspecified crime. A group of former world leaders, led by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, tried to see the American detainee when they visited Pyongyang last week, but North Korean officials didn't allow it.

In the latest incident, North Korea's state media said three Japanese men were arrested in the northeast port city of Rason on March 14 for engaging in unspecified drug trafficking and counterfeit activities.

State news agency KCNA identified the men as Hidehiko Abe, Takumi Hirooka and Masaki Furuya. KCNA said Mr. Furuya was expelled from the country and the other two will be put on trial. No other details were available.

Japan's foreign ministry said Wednesday it was investigating the situation.

"We are still in the process of fact-finding," a ministry spokesman said. "We are trying to confirm the facts concerned. We would like to refrain from commenting further due to the nature of the case."

North Korea in 2003 questioned a Japanese man on suspicion of drug smuggling and held him until 2009.

The American citizen, identified by North Korea as Jun Young Su, is the fifth American to be detained in the North over the past two years. In the previous four detentions, North Korea made public shows of the arrests, charges and trials of the Americans before releasing them. In two cases, former American presidents, including Mr. Carter, traveled to Pyongyang to secure releases.
