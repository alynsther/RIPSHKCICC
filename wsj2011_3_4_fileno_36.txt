The famous, French, colorful macaron cookie is the focus of Macaron Café, a little jewel box of a spot in Midtown East owned by husband and wife team Cecile and Arnaud Cannone. 



Ms. Cannone makes about 50 kinds of macarons that rotate with the seasons: dark chocolate and mocha during the winter and flowers and fruits in warm weather. Recent standouts included chestnut and cassis, at $2.25 each.

Though it's tempting to indulge in a confection-only lunch, the café also makes seven sandwiches and lovely packaged salads, priced from $6.75 to $10. Go for the Paris sandwich with ham, Gruyère cheese, a mustard-mayonnaise and little cornichon pickles. 

For a warm lunch, go on Tuesdays for the croque monsieur special and grab one of the tables in the back.

The Midtown branch opened last summer and attracts a fashionable female crowd. A second location in the Garment District, at 485 Seventh Ave. and 36th Street, has fewer tables and is better for a to-go lunch.
