Denver Nuggets star Carmelo Anthony might be headed to the Nets, according to multiple reports. 

Yahoo! Sports reported that the Nets, Nuggets and Detroit Pistons were making progress on a three-team swap that would include 13 players. The Nets would ship point guard Devin Harris, rookie forward Derrick Favors, guards Anthony Morrow, Ben Uzoh, Stephen Graham and Quinton Ross and two first-round draft picks to Denver. 

The report said the Nets would also acquire guard Richard Hamilton from the Pistons, as well as point guard Chauncey Billups, guard Anthony Carter and forward Shelden Williams from the Nuggets. The Nets would send Troy Murphy and Johan Petro to the Pistons. 

Mr. Anthony, a former Syracuse University star, is a free agent after this season. The 26-year-old has averaged 23.8 points this season. In an interview after his team's defeat against the Knicks last month, Mr. Anthony said he didn't think the Nuggets would trade him to a team he didn't want to go to but was mum on any interest in specific teams, especially the Knicks.
