You will probably want to pick up and play "Little Big Planet 2," the sequel to one of PlayStation's 3's most surprisingly successful franchises, on aesthetics alone—its diorama-size, photorealistic world is as masterfully art directed as a Pixar film, with levels that have fantastical, idiosyncratic themes like "Steampunk and Cake" (think Martha Stewart meets "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"). 

But why you'll keep playing for weekends on end is because, well, you can: You'll master the super-simple controls even if you haven't picked up a controller since "Super Mario Bros.," and the millions (yes, millions) of cheeky, user-generated, Rube Goldberg-machine-like levels makes it more addictive than "Angry Birds" and Twitter—combined.
