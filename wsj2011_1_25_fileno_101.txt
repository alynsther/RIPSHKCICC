What does a former Silicon Valley CEO who's just poured $150 million into a failed political campaign do postmortem? For one, not agonize over her defeat. California's Republican gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman skipped the state's traditional post-election conference earlier this month, where campaign consultants, pollsters and journalists gathered to discuss the race. It was the first time since 1990 that the political loser's team failed to show up.

"I don't know that it makes sense to rehash the whole thing," Ms. Whitman, the former eBay CEO, told the San Francisco Chronicle. Yet sources close to Ms. Whitman say that she was baffled by her 13-point defeat to Democrat Jerry Brown and has sought an explanation for what went wrong in case she decides to mount another political campaign.

Ms. Whitman's corporate ties and reluctance to give interviews during the campaign became fodder for her opponents. But she seems unwilling to change her ways. Her first speaking engagement since the election took place at the Harvard Club of San Francisco and was open only to young female Harvard graduates. Her appearance at the Bay Area Council later this month is also closed to the press.

While some have speculated that Ms. Whitman may be mulling a challenge to Sen. Dianne Feinstein in 2012, her recent appointment to the Hewlett-Packard board of directors makes that possibility less likely. If she were to run for office again, Ms. Whitman's role on the board would likely be criticized as a conflict of interest.

Some conservatives have suggested that she use her wealth instead to bankroll political initiatives. That could help rehabilitate her image and earn chits with party leaders, some of whom think she threw away the governor's race by running a tone-deaf campaign. Ms. Whitman would do well to consider their advice.
