For the past decade, the Dallas Mavericks have fallen into an unfortunate annual routine. They post a strong regular-season record, enter the playoffs with hype and expectations—and promptly break fans' hearts by bowing out early. The epitome of "close, but no cigar."

It turns out Dallas's recent trend of regular-season excellence and postseason futility is historic.

The Mavericks have had the best-ever 10-year stretch in the NBA without winning a championship. Through Saturday, they had gone 534-236 (.694) in the regular season since 2001-02. During that stretch, they earned a top-four seed in the Western Conference playoffs six times and won at least 60 games three times, but they reached the finals just once—losing to Miami in 2006. They have fallen in the first round in three of the past four seasons.

The Mavericks are rivaled in springtime disappointment by the Jazz of the 1990s: Utah went 542-246 (.688) from 1989-90 through 1998-99 and from 1990-91 through 1999-00. In some ways, both teams can blame Phil Jackson. Utah reached the finals in 1997 and '98, only to lose to Mr. Jackson's Bulls. Mr. Jackson went on to coach the Lakers, which won three titles during the Mavs' stretch and reached the finals five times.

But, citizens of Dallas, it could always be worse. The Oakland Raiders went 103-29-8 (.776) from 1966-75 without winning the Super Bowl, marking the best—or worst?—stretch in the history of the four major sports.
