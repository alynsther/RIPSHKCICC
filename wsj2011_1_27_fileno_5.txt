WASHINGTONâ€”President Barack Obama named Jay Carney to be White House press secretary Thursday, elevating a former journalist to be a prominent public face of the administration.

Mr. Carney, the communications director for Vice President Joe Biden, replaces Robert Gibbs, a longtime member of Mr. Obama's inner circle. Mr. Gibbs plans to take some time off and then begin working on Mr. Obama's re-election campaign. 

The selection of Mr. Carney was one of more than a dozen appointments announced on Thursday, as newly installed Chief of Staff William Daley puts his team in place.

Mr. Carney, 45, was a reporter and Washington bureau chief for Time magazine for 20 years before taking the job as Mr. Biden's chief spokesman at the start of the administration two years ago.

He will report to Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer, who will now oversee the press operation. Though Mr. Carney he will not serve as a counselor to Mr. Obama, as Mr. Gibbs did, a White House official said he would have the access he needs in order to speak for the president.

The official said that Mr. Carney was chosen based on his work for Mr. Biden and his experience covering two other administrations. He also has experience on television from his days as a reporter.

The White House also named two new deputy chiefs of staff: Nancy-Ann DeParle, who will focus on policy, and Alyssa Mastromonaco, Mr. Obama's longtime scheduler, who will oversee operations. Ms. DeParle has been leading a White House office devoted to health care.

Rob Nabors will serve as legislative director, replacing Phil Schiliro, who plans to depart.

David Lane will be counselor to Mr. Daley. Mr. Lane served Mr. Daley's chief of staff when he was Commerce secretary and was, more recently, president of ONE, which fights poverty and disease in Africa.
