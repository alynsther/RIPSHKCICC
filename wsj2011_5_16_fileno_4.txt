  Gauri Anand, an analyst with MF Global Sify Securities India Pvt. Ltd., paid close attention to government action in the chemicals sector in analyzing stocks in 2010. 

That strategy paid off for the Mumbai-based Ms. Anand, the top-ranked chemicals analyst in the Asia's Best Analysts survey.



"We saw reforms for phosphatics much ahead of the industry," she said, explaining that the government deregulated the prices of phosphatics—nutrients containing phosphate that help plants grow—in February. "We continue to like the phosphatic fertilizer space, but we expect the stocks to consolidate given the splendid run last year."

Ms. Anand's top picks in 2010 were fertilizer producers  Coromandel International Ltd. and  Zuari Industries Ltd., both of which she maintained buy ratings on throughout the year. The companies' shares returned 171% and 49%, respectively, on the year. 

Ms. Anand, 29 years old, said this year she's watching stocks in the urea chemicals sector, which she believes the government is soon going to deregulate. Urea is a plant fertilizer that contains nitrogen.

"Reform in urea, if delayed, may further threaten the existing nutrient imbalance in soil and risk productivity—something the government may want to avoid [when it] is battling the already-high food inflation," she said. 

Based on this hypothesis, Ms. Anand likes urea-producing companies and recommends Chambal Fertilizers and Chemicals, whose shares returned 16% on her buy rating and 37% on her hold rating in 2010. 

Ms. Anand's other top picks for 2010 included  Tata Chemicals Ltd.,which returned 25% on the year, and  Deepak Fertilisers & Petrochemicals Corp. Ltd., which returned 57% on a full-year basis.
