NEW DELHI â€“ Finnish mobile handset maker Nokia Corp. said Monday it has set up servers in India for its consumer email services and is testing solutions that will let the country's security agencies monitor such services. 

"We have completed our commitment," D. Shivakumar, vice president and managing director, Nokia India, told reporters. He said that testing is likely to be completed in the next three months. 

Mr. Shivakumar clarified that the company was in talks with the government to let the country's security agencies monitor consumer email services, and not corporate email services. 

India's government has been concerned about corporate email services such as those which run on Canada-based  Research In Motion Ltd.'s BlackBerry smartphones. India fears that the highly encrypted emails sent through the smartphones make them convenient for terrorists to use undetected. 

RIM has already provided access to its messenger services--another service which was under the lens of security agencies--but has maintained it can't provide a solution for corporate emails as there is no technology available that will allow monitoring of the service.
