LONDONâ€”Britain's former top legal official says Tony Blair insisted the U.K. could join the 2003 invasion of Iraq without additional backing from the U.N., despite legal advice which told him that was untrue.

Lord Goldsmith, the attorney general between 2001 and 2007, told the country's inquiry into the Iraq war that he was uncomfortable with the then-prime minister's claim that a U.N. resolution specifically authorizing the U.S.-led invasion would not be necessary under certain circumstances.

Lord Goldsmith told the Chilcot inquiry that he had advised Mr. Blair a further resolution was needed. Mr. Blair makes a second public appearance before the inquiry on Friday.

Lord Goldsmith's comments were disclosed late Monday as the panel released partial transcripts of private hearings.
