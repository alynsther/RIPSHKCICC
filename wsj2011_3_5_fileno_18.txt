Asian markets were cheered by Wall Street's Thursday rally, but European bourses fell after rising oil prices turned investors' eyes back on the volatile situation in the Middle East and North Africa.

Traders in Europe also had a weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs report to digest.

The Stoxx Europe 600 index rose to as high as 285.4, but turned lower after the payrolls report. It ended down 0.6% at 281.90. It fell 0.8% on the week.

"Anticipation of a strong jobs number is what drove the markets [Thursday]. It wasn't going to do it again [Friday]," said Bernard McAlinden, strategist at NCB Stockbrokers. Still, he is optimistic for the medium term, saying that despite rising risks from the unnrest in the Middle East and North Africa, markets are likely to push higher. The biggest threat to the rally remains rising commodity prices.

Losses on the Stoxx Europe 600 were cushioned by oil-services companies. Maritime oil and gas engineer SBM Offshore rose 6.3% after it delivered a better-than-expected increase in operating profit in 2010. Peers Petrofac and Technip rose 3.2% and 1.3%, respectively.

The biggest decliners included French retailer Carrefour, which slumped 4.4% after a Citigroup downgrade to "sell" from "neutral." The broker warned that the proposed spinoffs of the group's Dia hard-discount unit and property business would lead to €1.1 billion ($1.54 billion) of direct value loss.

Deal news moved some shares. Crédit Agricole fell 1% after agreeing to buy Belgian bank unit Centea from financial-services group KBC for €527 million. KBC, which has received billions of euros in state aid to help it weather the financial crisis, was required to sell the unit by European Union regulators. The deal will significantly boost Crédit Agricole's position in Belgium. KBC shares rose 2.7%.

In PARIS, the CAC 40 index fell 1% to 4020.21, leaving it down 1.2% for the week—weighed down utility stocks such as Veolia Environnement, down 3.7%, and GDF Suez, which fell 2.3%. Veolia posted flat annual profit and said it would accelerate divestments in the medium term.

In LONDON, the FTSE 100 index finished the day and the week down 0.2% at 5990.39. One of the biggest decliners was advertising and media concern WPP, which slipped 2.6% though it reported a 34% increase in 2010 net profit and forecast organic revenue growth of around 5% this year.
