Every year, the Cheltenham Gold Cup is arguably the highlight of the British horseracing season, a three-mile spree in the Gloucestershire countryside that pits the best jumps horses in the U.K. and Ireland against each other in the climax of the four-day festival.

Even by its traditionally high standards, the 2011 edition of this race looks to have a strong field: Each of the last four Gold Cup winners will be present when the horses line up on Friday. Kauto Star and Denman have been wonderful servants for trainer Paul Nicholls, but they are now both 11 years old and no horse older than 10 has won the Gold Cup since What A Myth in 1969. Neither horse can be ruled out in what promises to be a wide-open race, but it's difficult to see either doing better than a top-four finish.

Last year's winner, Imperial, Commander, will go off as favorite this time and is worth backing at 10/3. Although he's a 10-year-old, he is still fairly lightly raced and Nigel Twiston-Davies, his trainer, has had him focused on this race all season.

Long Run was a hugely impressive winner of the King George, but he hasn't shown his best form at Cheltenham and looks too short at 9/2 with Stan James.

There is rain forecast for Friday and if it does arrive, the softer turf will likely suit Pandorama, currently available at 14/1 with Boylesports, although he remains an outside bet if the going is quicker than good-to-soft.

In a quality supporting card, Join Together in the Albert Bartlett and Sir Des Champs in the Martin Pipe Conditionals race both stand out. They are young horses with the potential to be excel over the next couple of seasons.
