Arsenal must overcome a surprise first-leg defeat against Ipswich Town in order to reach the first major final of the English football season on Tuesday.

The Gunners host Ipswich in the Carling Cup second-leg encounter at the Emirates Stadium just two weeks after the second division club upset the odds with a 1-0 first-leg victory. 

That result was not without controversy: Cesc Fabregas, the Arsenal captain, likened Ipswich's tactics to being more "rugby" than football, but Arsenal will have to adapt to the visiting team's style if it is to progress to next month's final.

Oddsmakers are convinced it will do so: Arsenal is a best-priced 2/13 with Unibet to win inside 90 minutes and a general 1/5 to qualify. At such short odds, a better bet is the Premier League club to win "to nil" at 4/5. Ipswich sits just above the relegation places in English football's second tier and has failed to score in five of its eight away defeats this season.

On Wednesday, West Ham United travels to Birmingham City in the other semifinal knowing it simply needs to avoid defeat at St Andrew's to reach the final. The trouble for Hammers coach Avram Grant is that his side hasn't kept held an opponent scoreless in an away game for over 12 months.

West Ham is favorite to qualify at 8/11 but it may be wiser to back both teams to score at 10/11 given the visiting team's poor defensive record. Birmingham has also conceded at least once in each of its last 11 fixtures.
