 Cardio Trainer 

While its main function is to serve as a pedometer that uses your phone's built-in GPS to track your distance, route and calories burned, Cardio Trainer also comes with a suite of separately available (but free) add-ons like "Weight Loss" and "Resolutions" to keep you motivated. The latter, in particular, helps you stick to, say, three workouts a week by asking you to pledge a certain amount of money to charity if you don't meet your weight-loss or workout goals.

 NikeWomen Training Club 

Need a coach to teach you technique and motivate you as you exercise? The recently redesigned NikeWomen Training Club does just that, thanks to a simple interface that lets you choose workouts based on goals (strength, toning or weight loss) or time (everything from targeted 15-minute workouts to more involved 30- and 45-minute routines). Click on a program and let the virtual coaches talk you through (and demo via video) each exercise—a mix of cardio and weight-training—all set to a soundtrack you create from your iTunes library.

 FitnessClass 

The 230 streaming video classes available here—everything from boot camp-style weight-loss sessions to stress-reducing yoga—put most other gym apps to shame. The classes are perfect for squeezing in a workout on the fly since they come in schedule-sensitive segments of as little as 10 minutes (or as much as 60 minutes). Be warned: Your iPad will need a 3G or Wi-Fi connection to stream classes. Still, if you're embarrassed to try pilates in public, this could be the ticket. $3-$8 for individual classes and 30-day class passes, pumpone.com
