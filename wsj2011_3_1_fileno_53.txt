There's a lot to contend with when eating lunch at SD26, a contemporary Italian restaurant on the edge of Madison Square Park. 

You've got to be careful not to get sucked into the iPad wine list and forget about the person across the table. You need to decide whether to pick the $25 "nutritionally balanced" one-course meal designed to provide energy for the rest of the work day "without compromising the pleasure of the senses" or the $26 two-course prix fixe. 

If you pick the latter option, tell your handheld computer-toting server to tap in an order for the uovo, a single, large piece of ravioli filled with soft cheese and a still-runny egg yolk doused in truffled butter. There's also a mix of salads or small Italian mains, including scallop saltimbocca with potatoes, prosciutto and sage and a fillet of veal with mushrooms and onion. The "balanced lunch" option changes daily, but usually includes pasta, fish or meat, salad and fruit.
