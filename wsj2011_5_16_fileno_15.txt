Excitement is building for Australia's truffle hunters as cooler weather hints at winter's approach.

The season runs from late May to September down under — in France, black-truffle season lasts from November to March — with farms in Western Australia harvesting a couple of weeks before the eastern states. Australia's truffle production is concentrated in the colder parts of the country, where conditions are more favorable for growing the fungus.

"The temperature is decreasing, that's good for the truffles to mature," says Sake van Weeghel, chief executive of the Wine & Truffle Co. in Western Australia state. "They take the cold snap to mature and build up the aroma."

Some describe that aroma as "dirty-sock," though Mr. van Weeghel's adjectives of choice are "earthy" and "mystical." It sends gourmands into raptures. The underground bulbous fungus is used to add a luxuriant flavor to dishes — 18th-century French gastronome Brillat-Savarin described it as "the diamond of the kitchen."

Truffles are a growing business in Australia. The country's first truffière — truffle farm — was established in Tasmania, Australia's southern island state, in 1992, with the first truffle harvested in 1999. Today, the Australian Truffle Grower's Association estimates, there are more than 150 growers, and in a 2008 report it forecast that by 2013 Australia would produce up to 10 tons of truffles. Annual production in France is estimated at 20 tons a year.

The Wine & Truffle company farm — the country's largest producer of truffles — sits in Manjimup in the state's southwestern corner and has about 13,000 hazelnut and oak trees. Mr. van Weeghel expects it to produce a bumper harvest of 2.5 metric tons of French black truffles (Tuber melanosporum). The gourmet ingredient sells for about 3,000 Australian dollars (US$3,200) a kilogram and will be exported to 20 countries, including Germany, the U.S., Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong — and France.
