 BUILDING HOMES We regularly hear from readers who ask about opportunities for so-called volunteer vacations, which mix travel with good deeds. One of the most rewarding: Habitat for Humanity's Global Village program. Yes, the celebrated nonprofit offers a number of trips within the U.S., in which volunteers help build housing for families in need. But Habitat also has a large presence overseas. (And you don't spend all your time hammering. The organization promises a healthy balance of "work, rest and free time.") Among the destinations this year: Macedonia, Senegal, India, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal and Brazil.

 HAVE BOOKS, WILL TRAVEL If you're looking for ideas for your next vacation, or simply enjoy great travel writing, spend some time with Trip Lit, one of several columns that are part of the National Geographic Traveler website. Each month,  Don George, a veteran travel writer and editor, highlights and reviews top travel books. Some of his recent favorites: "Radio Shangri-La," by  Lisa Napoli, a look at the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan; "The View From Lazy Point," by  Carl Safina, a profile of eastern Long Island; and "Atlantic," by  Simon Winchester, a "biography" of the Atlantic Ocean. A good read and a valuable resource.
