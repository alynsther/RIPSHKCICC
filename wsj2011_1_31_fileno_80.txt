The Mets will host the 2013 All-Star Game at Citi Field, according to a baseball official. Neither the Mets nor Major League Baseball has officially announced the decision, but that is a mere formality. It will be the Mets' first time hosting the All-Star Game since 1964, their first season at Shea Stadium, ending the longest drought of any major-league team. Also, the Mets avoided arbitration with pitcher R.A. Dickey, who agreed to a two-year, $7.5 million deal with a club option for a third year. The deal will become official once Mr. Dickey passes a physical.



Devils winger Patrik Elias scored a goal and added an assist for Team Staal in Sunday's NHL All-Star game, but it wasn't enough, as Team Lidstrom defeated Team Staal, 11-10. Rangers goalie Henrik Lundqvist made 11 saves on 14 shots in 18 minutes of action during the high-scoring affair. Rangers defenseman Marc Staal, playing alongside his brother Eric, who was captain of Team Staal, did not record a point in 17 minutes of action. For the first time, teams this season were selected by captains in a draft held on Friday night.

Would the Jets make a play for former Giants wide receiver Plaxico Burress, who is still serving a two-year prison sentence on a gun-related charge? During a conference call last week, Jets general manager Mike Tannenbaum didn't completely rule it out. "If and when a player is reinstated, we can look at that," Mr. Tannenbaum said. "I just don't like to deal in hypotheticals for now. We've got plenty of other players to look at and decisions to make. We'll be focused on those." In August 2009, Mr. Burress pleaded guilty to one count of attempted criminal possession of a weapon. He is due to be released in June.
