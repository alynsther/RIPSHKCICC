Blake Comeau's tip-in with 57.3 seconds left in overtime led the New York Islanders to a victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs on Tuesday night.

Michael Grabner scored his 27th goal at 8:40 of the third period to give New York a 3-2 lead. But the advantage lasted for just over a minute as Nikolai Kulemin tied it.

Zenon Konopka and Frans Nielsen also scored for the Islanders, who have won 11 of 19 since the All-Star break.
