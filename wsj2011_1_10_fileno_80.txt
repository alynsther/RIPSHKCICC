Former Jets running back Curtis Martin on Sunday was named a finalist for the Pro Football Hall of Fame's class of 2011. Mr. Martin played the final eight seasons of his career with the Jets after spending his first three with the New England Patriots. A five-time Pro Bowl selection, he finished with 14,101 rushing yards, which ranks fourth all-time in the NFL.

Mr. Martin, who last played at the conclusion of the 2005 season but did not officially announce his retirement until 2007, is one of five first-year eligible players who are being considered for election. 

The 44-member selection committee will meet Feb. 5 to vote for the next round of inductees.

Rangers winger Alex Frolov is out for the season after tearing his right ACL in Saturday's win over the St. Louis Blues. Mr. Frolov has seven goals and nine assists this season, his first with the Blueshirts, failing to live up to his past production—he hit 50 points for five straight seasons prior to this one. In addition to the torn ACL, he also suffered a sprained MCL and a medial meniscus tear in his right knee. The team recalled forward Kris Newbury from the AHL on Sunday.

On Saturday night, Notre Dame punctured St. John's inflating confidence like a nail in a tire. Old problems—poor shooting and key turnovers—resurfaced as the 10-4 Red Storm saw their five-game winning streak snapped in a 76-61 loss to the Irish. 

The loss was St. John's first in the Big East after three consecutive victories to start conference play. Now the Red Storm will try to regain the savvy playmaking and sharp shooting that propelled them to an upset over Georgetown earlier this month, when they host No. 4 Syracuse on Wednesday night at Madison Square Garden. Tip-off is 7 p.m.
