Asian markets struggled for direction Tuesday, with Australian stocks lifted by news of lower-than-expected inflation, while Chinese and Hong Kong shares dropped on lingering concerns Beijing could soon raise interest rates.

Indonesian and Philippine stocks rebounded after a string of recent declines, while Indian shares turned volatile in afternoon trading as banks declined after the central bank raised interest rates by an expected one0-quarter of a percentage point. 

Several regional markets got a lift in the wake of a solid advance on Wall Street overnight, which helped Japan's Nikkei Stock Average climb 1.2% on the back of exporters. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 gained 0.5%, South Korea's Kospi added 0.2% and Taiwan's Taiex edged up 0.5%. 

Chinese stocks fell on weak commodity prices and on worries about further tightening measures.

"We expect the government to raise interest rates in February as January's consumer-price index may be higher than November's" 28-month high of 5.1%, said Lu Zhengwei, an economist from Industrial Bank. He also expected another reserve requirement ratio increase in February. 

The Shanghai Composite dropped 0.7%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index slipped 0.1%.

Resource-sector shares led declines in Shanghai on weakness in global commodity prices, with PetroChina Co. falling 0.8%, Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd. falling 2.7% and Zijin Mining Group Co. shrinking 3.1%.

In Hong Kong, Cnooc shed 0.6% and China Coal Energy Co. dropped 0.9%.

India's Sensex fell 1%, hitting lenders, after the Reserve Bank of India raised its lending rates.

Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell two points in screen trade.

The Sydney market was lifted by benign inflation data, which lessened the risk of a near-term interest-rate increase by the Reserve Bank of Australia. The country's fourth-quarter consumer-price index rose 0.4% on quarter and 2.7% on year, compared with economists' expectations for a 0.7% on-quarter rise and a 3% on-year increase.

"The RBA can sit tight for quite some time," said BNP Paribas economist Dominic Bryant. He said that the central bank was unlikely to raise rates this year. "There's a lack of underlying price pressures present."

Resource- and retail-sector stocks led the rise, with Rio Tinto advancing 0.5% and Fortescue Metals Group climbing 0.9%, while Woolworths rose 1.6%.

Shares of Virgin Blue Holdings fell 2.4% after the airline issued a profit warning for the fiscal first half, citing the recent severe floods in the Queensland state and an outage of its booking system that disrupted flights in September.

Solid gains on Wall Street drove broad-based increases in Tokyo, led by exporters. There was little reaction to the Bank of Japan's widely expected decision to keep its policy interest-rate target unchanged, in a 0% to 0.1% range. Sony Corp. rose 2.3% and Toyota Motor Corp. rose 1.5%.

Some traders, however, said gains were likely to be limited due to lingering concerns of further policy tightening in China. 

"Japanese shares have been rising for nearly three months so we can expect further correction ahead," said Masayoshi Yano, senior market analyst at Meiwa Securities.
