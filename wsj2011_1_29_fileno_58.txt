The federal budget deficit will hit a record of nearly $1.5 trillion in 2011 because of the weak economy, higher spending and fresh tax cuts, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said Wednesday, in a stark warning that will drive the growing battle over government spending and taxation. Friday brought better news, as the Commerce Department estimated annualized economic growth of 3.2% in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission issued its report, finding that 12 of the 13 largest U.S. financial institutions "were at risk of failure" at the nadir of the 2008 financial crisis, while at least 50 hedge funds tried to capitalize on it. 

Fresh evidence suggested anxious BP staff on the doomed Deepwater Horizon rig voiced concerns to their bosses. Three days before it exploded, the onshore manager in charge of the rig warned his supervisor that last-minute procedural changes were creating "chaos," and was urged to tell rig workers "to hang in there." The supervisor then signed off to attend a dance practice, promising to call later in the day. "We're dancing to the Village People!" he wrote.

Tucson shooting suspect Loughner pleaded not guilty to charges of attempted assassination and attempted murder of federal employees. Further charges are likely.

Obama used his State of the Union address to urge the nation to meet the challenges of a global economy, framing what he called a competitiveness agenda. It includes infrastructure investment and traditional Democratic proposals like increased education spending, amid the rise of powers like China and India, alongside gestures to Republicans seeking deep budget cuts. Results from a national exam released the day of the speech revealed that fewer than one-third of elementary- and high-school students have a solid grasp of science. The speech also laid out areas of potential cooperation between the parties, including a call to rewrite the corporate tax code. The Republican-controlled House wants much deeper and more immediate cuts in domestic spending.

Obama's new team is coming together, including White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, National Economic Council Director Gene Sperling and Press Secretary Jay Carney. Some of the same business groups the president has been courting said they would fight his renomination of Craig Becker to the National Labor Relations Board. Joseph Smith, the administration's pick to run the agency that oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, doesn't want to be renominated, in the face of strong Republican opposition, a White House official said. Energy czar Carol Browner is leaving her post, which is likely to be eliminated. The position, and Browner herself, have been lightning rods for critics of the president's environmental policy.

Uprisings in Egypt shook the Arab world, threatened the future of some of Washington's closest allies in the region and raised the specter that Islamic radicals could seize on the protests against authoritarian governments. Egypt's President Mubarak, defying Washington's call to embrace reform, declared a curfew in riot-racked cities as tanks rolled down the street to beat back protesters. Nobel Peace Prize laureate and pro-democracy reformer ElBaradei returned, stoking the rallies. Local stocks and the Egyptian pound plunged. The rallies, in Jordan, Yemen and Algeria, too, were inspired by the toppling of Tunisian President Ben Ali on Jan. 14. In Lebanon, meanwhile, the ouster of a Western-allied government set back U.S. efforts to blunt the influence of Iran and Syria in the region. 

Leaked documents show extensive collaboration between Palestinian security forces and their Israeli counterparts, a relationship Israeli commanders say has been central to security gains in the West Bank. The documents, released by al Jazeera, spurred anger in the Palestinian territories at the Palestinian Authority leadership, which has held uncompromising positions in public but appears to have negotiated poorly with Israel in private.

The threat of inflation, the burden of public pensions and Europe's approach to its debt crisis dominated the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. China sent its largest delegation ever, underlining its growing influence on the global economy. Important Chinese companies are considering stepped-up investment in the U.S., with the White House's encouragement. Meanwhile, world-wide fears about unsustainable government borrowing reached Japan, as S&P issued a surprise downgrade of its bonds, the first since 2002, and slammed the nation's political leaders for having no "coherent strategy" to tackle Japan's quickly worsening fiscal problems.

Ford Motor reported an unexpected drop in fourth-quarter earnings, to $190 million from $886 million a year earlier, on rising costs in North America, a loss in Europe and special charges related to debt-reduction measures. It was also a big decline from the $1.7 billion Ford made in the 2010 third quarter. The year was one of Ford's best ever.

Companies tracking Internet users' interests and activities across unaffiliated websites.

Increase in the consumer price index for food between 2009 and 2010, the mildest increase since 1962. Food inflation is heating up again after one of its slowest years in decades. Food-at-home prices in 2010 were up just 0.3% from the year before, the lowest annual increase since 1967, and restaurant prices climbed 1.3%, the smallest yearly increase since 1955. 

U.S. tornadoes last year, among the 10 busiest years since records began in 1950. Minnesota came in first, for the first time, with 104 twisters. The Atlantic region was far stormier. 

Optimal bank capital-to-assets ratio, Bank of England economists say. 

Banks will need a lot more capital if we want to avoid financial disasters like the one that just shook the world, according to the economists. Critics say that would hurt the economy by pushing up the cost of lending. But in a new paper, the economists estimate that a permanent one-percentage-point reduction in the probability of crisis is worth more than half a year's economic output, or about nine times the cost of permanently doubling banks' capital ratios. Assuming that severe crises tend to come along every few decades or so, the optimal capital level would be 52% of assets, weighted according to their riskiness. That compares to the 7% requirement most big banks must meet by 2019.

Appaloosa's  David Tepper and Bridgewater's  Ray Dalio each made between $2 billion and $3 billion in 2010. The gains came on winning bets on commodities, emerging-market companies, bank shares and Treasury bonds, among others.
