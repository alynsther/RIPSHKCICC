MUMBAI â€“ India's capital markets regulator and the central bank are combining efforts in the investigation of an alleged 3-billion rupee ($70 million) fraud, involving an employee of Citigroup Inc.'s Indian wealth management operations, even as the net is cast wider to get to the bottom of the scam. 

"There are a whole lot of investigations that are being conducted. We need to get a sense of what went wrong first...Co-ordination is happening very much now and the Reserve Bank of India and SEBI are working together to find out what went wrong," said K.M. Abraham, a whole time member at the Securities and Exchange Board of India, on the sidelines of an industry event. 

The Citibank employee, Shivraj Puri, a relationship manager, was arrested after the local unit of Citigroup Inc. said late last month that it has initiated an investigation into the transactions at a branch following some suspicious movements. 

A defrauded bank customer, Sanjeev Agarwal, who says he was duped in the scam, later registered a case with the Indian police naming among others, Citi's Chief Executive Vikram Pandit, former senior vice chairman William R. Rhodes, Chief Operating Officer Douglas Peterson, Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach and three others. 

The Reserve Bank of India has received a report from Citi India, the central bank's spokeswoman said when the scam broke. 

Citigroup said in a statement on Jan. 5 that Mr. Agarwal's claims against senior executives "are completely without basis and we intend to contest them vigorously." The bank said it identified the fraud and immediately reported the matter to the regulators and law-enforcement agencies. 

"It was on Citi's complaint that the Gurgaon police lodged an FIR [first information report] and are currently investigating the matter. Citi will continue to work with the authorities on this investigation," Citigroup said. 

Mr. Agarwal is among several involved in the investment vehicle. Earlier in January, the police arrested Sanjay Gupta, the chief financial officer of Hero Corporate Services, a Hero Group firm, on allegations of receiving commissions to invest Hero's money in the vehicle. 

SEBI's K.M. Abraham said the regulator was looking at wealth management practices across the industry to see if there is a systemic problem that led to the alleged Citi fraud. 

India has been hit by several scams this fiscal year that ends March 31. 

While the allegations of irregularities in the allotment of mobile-telephone spectrum and the organization of the Commonwealth Games largely involve politicians, eight senior officials of state-run banks and financial companies were arrested in late November on charges of taking bribes to facilitate loans to corporates. 

Separately, Mr. Abraham said that the market regulator's board would discuss investor feedback and decide on the final form of a new takeover code that has been in the works. 

"We did not have a board meeting after the takeover code went through public comments. Maybe we will wait for the board meeting to come out with a decision," he said. 

In July 2010, a panel set up by the capital markets regulator recommended raising the threshold that triggers a mandatory open offer by an acquirer to 25% from 15% and increasing the subsequent open offer size to 100% of the target firm from 20% to let more investors participate. 

SEBI set up the Takeover Regulation Advisory Committee in September 2009 to review the takeover rules and make them more relevant. SEBI last reviewed the code in 2002.
