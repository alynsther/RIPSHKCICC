NEW YORK—After dropping to their lowest levels in six weeks—as Japan's disaster left investors struggling to assess the financial implications—U.S. stocks rebounded in late afternoon to end with modest losses.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 51.24 points, or 0.43%, to 11993.16, shaving an earlier loss of 147. Earlier in the session, the measure dropped to its lowest intraday level in six weeks. 

  General Electric was the measure's worst performer with a drop of 44 cents, or 2.2%, to $19.92. The company supplied reactor No. 1 at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant about 150 miles from Tokyo. There was an explosion Saturday at the reactor following Friday's earthquake and tsunami. GE Chairman  Jeffrey Immelt said the U.S. conglomerate will offer technical assistance to its nuclear energy joint-venture partner  Hitachi Ltd. and the Japanese government. 

  Walt Disney was also weak with a decline of 69 cents, or 1.6%, to 42.24. The company's Tokyo Disneyland and Disney Sea theme parks on the outskirts of Tokyo were closed for what is expected to be a 10-day period following the earthquake.

Helping limit the Dow's drop,  Caterpillar climbed 2.08, or 2.1%, to 102.10,  Chevron added 87 cents, or 0.9%, to 100.80, and  Exxon Mobil edged up 26 cents, or 0.3%, to 82.38, boosted late in the session as crude-oil futures rose to above $101 a barrel. 

The Nasdaq Composite fell 14.64, 0.54%, to 2700.97. The Standard & Poor's 500 index shed 7.89, or 0.60%, to 1296.39. The energy sector was the only category that ended the session in the black, boosted by the late turnaround in crude prices. 

The declines followed a steeper slump in Asia. Japan's Nikkei Stock Average fell 6.2%, its worst one-day performance in more than two years, as the country's unfolding nuclear crisis deepened in the aftermath of the quake and tsunami. 

"The triple issue of the earthquake, tsunami and now the nuclear plant is enough to make anyone afraid," said  James Dailey, portfolio manager of Team Asset Strategy Fund.

  Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel, said he continues to worry about the situation in the Middle East and North Africa as well. Japan's earthquake "may have knocked the Middle East turmoil off the TV screen, but it's still there," he said.

Some market watchers are predicting that the recent stock declines—with the Dow falling for its third down day in the past four sessions—could be the start of a full 10% correction. However, others noted the market's resilience in recent months, saying the recent slip could be short-lived.

A 10% drop "certainly could happen," said  Stephen Carl, head equity trader at Williams Capital Group. "However, any time we have any kind of dip, it seems to be viewed more as a buying opportunity."

Among the stocks hit hardest by worries over Japan, uranium producers tumbled, with  Denison Mines down 74 cents, or 22%, to 2.55 and  Uranium Energy down 93 cents, or 19%, to 3.92. 

Shares of North American life insurers with exposure to Japan also lost ground, as Moody's Investors Service warned that insurance and reinsurance companies around the world face heavy losses following the earthquake in Japan, resulting in negative credit implications. 

  Hartford Financial Services Group fell 78 cents, or 2.8%, to 26.82, and  Manulife Financial shed 62 cents, or 3.5%, to 17.26. Shares of international insurer  Aflac were also weak with a drop of 1.65, or 3%, to 53.90. Some 70% to 75% of Aflac's earnings come from Japan, although the company said it isn't changing its earnings guidance for the year.

Shares of companies linked to renewable energy sources climbed, with American depositary receipts of  ReneSola up 34 cents, or 3.9%, to 9.05, while  Suntech Power Holdings rallied 24 cents, or 3%, to 8.28.

Among other stocks in focus,  Lubrizol jumped 29.24, or 28%, to 134.68. The lubricants and fuel-additives producer agreed to be bought by  Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway in a $9.7 billion deal. Class A shares of Berkshire Hathaway slipped 1,600, or 1.3%, 126,400, while Class B shares fell 1.09, or 1.3%, to 84.21. 

  Nasdaq OMX Group fell 82 cents, or 3%, to 26.37, as the Nasdaq Stock Market owner was in talks with bankers including  Bank of America to line up financing for a hostile bid for New York Stock Exchange parent  NYSE Euronext. Nasdaq is counting on  IntercontinentalExchange to purchase the parts of NYSE Euronext that Nasdaq cannot afford. Shares of NYSE Euronext climbed 1.58, or 4.5%, to 36.55, while IntercontinentalExchange slipped 1.28, or 1%, to 124.79. 

  Pfizer climbed 34 cents, or 1.8%, to 19.81. Bernstein told clients after a meeting with the drug giant's new chief executive that the company may pursue a breakup strategy. The investment bank speculated that Pfizer may shed not only its nonpharma assets, including consumer health, but also its generics business.
