The 57 pictures here constitute a sampler of the chaos and glory of the 20th century.

There is the triumph of Orville and Wilbur Wright's "First Flight, 120 Feet in 12 Seconds, 10:35 am, Kitty Hawk, North Carolina," photographed by their friend John T. Daniels on Dec. 17, 1903. The straightforward image represents the realization of centuries of human longing to be airborne.

There is a picture by an unknown photographer of the "Burning of the Von Hindenburg, 1937," the fiery disaster at Lakehurst, N.J., that ended public interest in passenger-carrying rigid airships. And there are two U.S. Air Force photos: "Aerial view of the total destruction of Hiroshima, Japan, 1945" and "The Crew of the 'Enola Gay,' the B-29 aircraft that dropped the Atomic Bomb on Hiroshima, 1945," thus terminating Japan's imperial ambitions.

For those of us who lived through this history, these photographs constitute much of our memory. 

Bob Jackson, a photographer for the Dallas Times-Herald, is not well known, but his "Jack Ruby Shooting Lee Harvey Oswald, November 24th, 1963" is part of our collective consciousness. Other images recall "US Runner Wilma Rudolph winning women's 100-meter race at Olympics, Rome, Italy, 1960," "Apollo 11 lifts off on historic flight to moon, Cape Kennedy, FL, 1969," "Buchenwald prisoners, Germany, 1945," and "Body of Che Guevara Lying in Laundry Room of Vallagrande Hospital, Bolivia, 1968," taken respectively by Mark Kauffman, Ralph Morse, Margaret Bourke-White, and history's indispensable Unknown.

Pentti Sammallahti is considered a national treasure by his countrymen, and is currently the subject of a 400-picture retrospective at the Finnish Museum of Photography in Helsinki. The 51 pictures at Alexander justify the Finns' estimation.

Mr. Sammallahti (born 1950) has an uncanny affinity for animals, and nearly every image in this exhibition has at least one animal in it. There are plenty of dogs, horses and sheep, a few monkeys, a rabbit, a frog and birds of several species. 

The creatures in the pictures are archaic remnants of Northern sagas and fairly tales, but simultaneously just corporeal fauna, frisking in the snow, feeding in the meadows or perched on telephone wires. They are couriers between two realms.

Mr. Sammallahti's photographs are small, some as little as 3.5 inches by 4.3 inches, and they are exquisitely printed. He is a master of infinite shades of gray, and frequently uses gold or selenium toning to subtle effect. The compositions, like the best of Scandinavian design, are spare and elegant. Snow, ice and somber mists figure in many of the works. 

The delicate beauty of Mr. Sammallahti's images is complemented by a delicate folkish humor, usually provided by the animals. 

See, for instance, "Helsinki, Finland, 1973," in which one of the two ice floes in a river is occupied by a pair of ducks serenely indifferent to the apparent cold.

China has been much in the news this month, so the exhibition of photographs by Hai Bo, born in Changchun, Jilin province, in 1962, prompts far-ranging speculation. 

Like China, the pictures are big, so big the gallery can accommodate only eight works. But, like the immense skyscrapers of Beijing that Guy Sorman, in a recent issue of City Journal, noted are one-third empty, many seem to lack significant content.

"Shadow – 2," (2009) takes up more than 20 square feet for an image of a bare room lit by bright sunlight streaming in from modern casement windows, empty except for a human skull on a cloth-draped table. This hokey image is repeated in "Shadow – 3," (2009) with the addition of a young man sitting on a stool before an easel holding a blank piece of paper: The man has no paints or brushes or drawing implements. Is "Shadow - 3" an allegory on the Chinese people, deprived by the Communists of philosophical resources to contemplate their mortality? Is it Hai Bo's image of himself?

"Passing Traveller," (2008) is less pretentious and more successful. An elderly man in a shabby military jacket walks toward us on a dirt road littered with water-filled potholes. The brass buttons on his jacket gleam, and the road, raised above a broad expanse of fields, seems to stretch back into an ancient, distant haze.
