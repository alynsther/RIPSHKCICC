Devin Harris scored nine of his 13 points in the fourth quarter as the Nets rallied to beat the Memphis Grizzlies Wednesday night in Newark.

The Grizzlies' O.J. Mayo missed a tying 3-point attempt with about 3 seconds left and the Nets' Brook Lopez iced the come-from-behind victory with two free throws, capping a 17-point performance.

Anthony Morrow had 19 points and Kris Humphries and Sasha Vujacic added 14 points apiece as the Nets closed out a 4-1 homestand that began with owner Mikhail Prokhorov halting trade talks with Denver for Carmelo Anthony.

The Nets bench outscored the Grizzlies subs by a 56-12 margin. The Nets also played good D. 

Rudy Gay had 22 points for Memphis, and Zach Randolph added 20 points and 16 rebounds in posting his career-high 12th consecutive double-double.
