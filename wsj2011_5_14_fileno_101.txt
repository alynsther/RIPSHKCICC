In 2004, India's then-ruling party, the Hindu-nationalist BJP, made 'India Shining' its optimistic slogan, promising prosperity. The same year, Danish photographer Jakob Carlsen traveled to India to photograph the lowest caste, or 'Untouchables,' of Hindu society. For while the BJP is known for its aggressive anti-Muslim stance in the states where it holds power, it is equally devoted to a traditional view of Hinduism and the caste system. Untouchability is reserved for the ritually unpure who handle tasks like cleaning latrines and sewers. Though untouchability has been decried since the start of the Indian independence movement in the 19th century—Gandhi called it 'a heinous crime against humanity'—the practice still keeps many millions in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Nepal bound to a wheel of grinding poverty. The black-and-white photographs in 'Outcast: The Repressed People of Asia' (Ajour, 216 pages, $46.95) are haunting: A sewer worker, splashed with excrement,lowers himself underground; women scavenge for food in a vast, open dump; a flooded-out fisherman appears resigned to receiving none of his village's emergency aid due to his low caste. In the slums of Bombay (above), a woman and child cross an open sewer to makeshift 'houses' rented illegally to Untouchables by railway workers. Mr. Carlsen found not 'Shining India' but faces burned by the midday sun, glowing with sweat and grease and lined from ceaseless toil.
