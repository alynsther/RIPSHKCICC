Is Roger Federer the underdog going into his second-round match at the Australian Open? Gilles Simon (pictured), the player that the defending champ faces next, happens to be one of just three on the men's tour (Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray are the others) to hold a winning record against Mr. Federer.
