With Ted Forstmann undergoing treatment for brain cancer, IMG Worldwide has appointed Mike Dolan, the company's executive vice president and chief financial officer, as president and chief operating officer.

In a memo to employees Thursday, Jim Gallagher, IMG's chief communications officer, stated: "Ted continues in his position as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and will be working closely with Mike to continue his long-term strategy of growing IMG's business." 

Mr. Dolan, 64, has been at IMG since March 2010, following a career that included senior management positions at Viacom, Inc., and chairman and CEO of Young & Rubicam.

Mr. Forstmann, 71, the longtime buyout kingpin, bought IMG for $750 million in 2004 and during the past six years has de-emphasized athlete representation and pushed IMG further into event management and collegiate sports marketing. He has been undergoing treatment for several weeks but has been in the office regularly and maintaining a busy social calendar, according to Mr. Gallagher.
