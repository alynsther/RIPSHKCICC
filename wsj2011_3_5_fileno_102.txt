In San Francisco, the husband-and-wife owners of Tartine, Chad Robertson and Elisabeth Prueitt, worked with local designer Joshu + Vela to create limited-edition carriers made out of sturdy yet extra-gentle organic cotton. $40, tartinebakery.com 

 Vegetarian Treats for Meat Lovers  

Published in Britain last year, London chef—and carnivore—Yotam Ottolenghi's "Plenty" is a vegetarian cookbook destined to find fans of any dietary stripe, with recipes for pomegranate-sprinkled roasted eggplant sauced with cooling buttermilk and yogurt as well as pizza topped with egg, pecorino cheese and spinach.

On Tuesday, an American version arrives to introduce another country of home cooks to the satisfactions that await beyond the meat aisle. $35, ottolenghi.co.uk 

 The Better Beef Bureau 

To support the artisans who are reviving the craft of butchery, chef Tia Harrison and Marissa Guggiana, author of a book about the country's best meatmen, founded the Butcher's Guild. 

According to the fraternity's oath, each member is dedicated to "whole animals raised on local farms, sold with integrity." In addition to setting higher standards for the profession, the organization aims to educate consumers about buying better beef. thebutchersguild.org
