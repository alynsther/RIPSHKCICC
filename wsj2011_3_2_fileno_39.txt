HONG KONG—Dadida, a manufacturer and retailer of children's clothing in China, aims to raise US$400 million-US$500 million from an initial public offering, people familiar with the situation said Wednesday. 

Dadida aims to list on the Hong Kong stock exchange as soon as September, one of the people said, adding that the company will use the proceeds from the offering to open stores and expand production facilities. 

  Deutsche Bank AG is one of the banks handling the deal, the people said. 

Dadida's listing plan comes less than six months after another Chinese retailer of children's products,  Boshiwa International Holding Ltd.

, raised US$369 million ahead of its Hong Kong listing in September. On the first day of trading, shares of Boshiwa soared 41% above the offer price of 4.98 Hong Kong dollars (64 U.S. cents) as rising spending on children's apparel and products in China buoyed investors' interest. 

Boshiwa closed down 2.3% at HK$4.63 on Wednesday. 

China's children's product market will likely almost double to 311 billion yuan ($47.33 billion) in 2013 from 165 billion yuan in 2009,  UBS AG said in a research report in November, citing data from business consultancy Frost & Sullivan. 

Activity in Hong Kong's IPO market is picking up after a slow start to the year—only seven IPOs raising a total of US$258 million had been completed as of Wednesday, according to data provider Dealogic. At least three companies, aiming to raise around US$3.5 billion, have plans to list in Hong Kong in the next few weeks. 

Recent weakness in Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index likely weighed on the territory's IPO market. The blue-chip index closed as low as 22,601 on Feb. 24 after rising as high as 24,988 last year, but has since rebounded around 2% from the year-to-date low.
