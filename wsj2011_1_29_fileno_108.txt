It's nearing the end of January. At this point, your new year's resolutions have probably been thrown out the window. So has the egg nog. (Definitely the egg nog.) But there is one holiday drink that you shouldn't treat like that pile of Christmas cards in the recycling bin: glühwein. A fancy German word for what we know as mulled wine, "glühwein" translates, literally, to "glow wine." Because that's what it does. After a long day of sledding, skiing or simply hauling the evergreen to the curb (next year, toss it on Jan. 1), a few sips of the warming, spicy, citrusy concoction will bring you back to life. 

The key to this recipe, by bartender Thad Vogler of San Francisco's Bar Agricole, is the Kammer Kirshwasser, a delicate German cherry brandy. "It gives the drink a nice aromatic blast as the spirit evaporates in the hot solution," he says. Naturally, it holds up well to hearty traditional German fare like sausages and potato pancakes. More importantly, however, it will carry you through the season until it's time to start drinking mojitos and margaritas again.
