The recession boosted San Franciscans' reliance on food assistance in the year ended Aug. 31, even as the number of homeless stayed stable, according to a December report from the U.S. Conference of Mayors. Overall, San Francisco distributed 42.2 million pounds of food to food pantries and emergency kitchens last year, up 16% from the previous year, the report found. That echoed nationwide findings, with all but one of the 25 cities surveyed saying they distributed more food last year than in 2009. City officials say that to reduce hunger, San Francisco needs more affordable housing, higher food-stamp payments and changes to federal assistance that would reflect the high cost of living here, according to the report. At the same time, the number of homeless people stayed the same as last year—at more than 6,000, according to the San Francisco Human Services Agency—and emergency shelters didn't turn anyone away. Departing Mayor Gavin Newsom is credited by community advocates with finding housing for thousands of formerly homeless people, which might have helped keep homelessness levels stable. San Francisco is one of 12 cities with stable or lower homelessness numbers in 2010, according to the report.
