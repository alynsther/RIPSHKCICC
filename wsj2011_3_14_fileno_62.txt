It's bracket season, the time when everyone from hardcore college-basketball fans to those who can't name one Pittsburgh Panther enters the office's NCAA tournament pool.

An interactive to help pick your NCAA bracket.

The trouble with bracket time, though, is that even the most analytical thinkers get corrupted by the archenemy of objectivity: emotion. It doesn't matter if your alma mater is stumbling down the stretch like Villanova; you're still having them win their first game. Likewise, if Kansas burned you last season, you're determined to prevent the Jayhawks from doing it again, no matter how good they look now (and their No. 1 seed).

Because countless brackets get ruined this way, the Count came up with a novel idea: What if you could fill out your entire bracket based on solid facts and evidence without knowing the names of the teams you were choosing? In other words, what if you could turn your bracket-making process into a blind taste test?

Starting Monday, you can—but only on WSJ.com. We've set up a bracket that describes every matchup throughout the tournament, only it replaces each team's name with a code name and some key stats and other information, allowing for unbiased picking. After you've completed your bracket, the code names will be replaced with the real ones, letting you know how you voted. 

So will it be the Amberjacks who go all the way, or the Zebras? Let the analysis begin.
