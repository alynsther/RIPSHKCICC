 The Strokes, 'Angles,' Tuesday

The New York band's initial meteoric rise gave way to inter-band squabbles and lukewarm reviews in recent years. Fans are hoping for a triumphant return to form. 

 Jennifer Hudson, 'I Remember Me,' Tuesday

The R&B singer issues her first album since three family members were murdered in 2008; recently she's become a spokeswoman for Weight Watchers.

 Chris Brown, 'F.A.M.E.,' Tuesday

His last album, in 2009, came out just months after he pleaded guilty to the assault of his then-girlfriend, Rihanna. This new attempted comeback got off to an uncertain start when "F.A.M.E." recently leaked online.

 Britney Spears, 'Femme Fatale,' March 29

After years of stumbles documented in the tabloids, the singer, 29, has re-emerged as a commercial rival to Lady Gaga—their respective singles recently had record downloads.

 Robbie Robertson, 'How to Become Clairvoyant,' April 5

It's the first solo album since 1998 for the 67-year-old guitarist, whose legacy is rooted in the Band. Recently, he's done music work on Martin Scorsese films such as "Shutter Island."
