With gritty defense and all-world goaltending, the Rangers have many of the trappings of a solid NHL playoff team. However, one key component is missing: They can't seem to win on their home ice.

The Blueshirts currently cling to the Eastern Conference's seventh seed despite having a sub-.500 record (14-15-3) at Madison Square Garden. This is troubling given that no team with a losing home record has made the playoffs since the NHL changed its point-scoring system in 1999-00. 

For Rangers fans, this story may sound familiar as New York missed the playoffs by a point last year largely due to a similarly disappointing performance at the Garden (18-17-6). 

The last 10 home games have been especially tough for the Rangers faithful. Seven of them have been losses—six in regulation. Five of those regulation losses have been by a single goal, including Tuesday night's loss to the Sabres that put them within three points of knocking New York out of the last playoff spot. A lack of scoring has been a huge problem for the Rangers of late, one compounded by the loss of top scorer Marian Gaborik. The power play has also been problematic all year (they rank 22nd in scoring percentage).

The silver lining of all this is that the Rangers fare well on the road—they enter Wednesday's action with the sixth-most road points despite ranking 18th in total points. Two of the worst home playoff teams in recent years—the 2001-02 Hurricanes and the 2005-06 Oilers—used a similar road prowess to advance all the way to the NHL finals, combining to win four road series clinchers. But if the Rangers don't start winning at home soon, they won't get a chance to show off their road moxie come playoff time in April.
