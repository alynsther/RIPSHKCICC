Social-networking company LinkedIn Corp. intends to file for an initial public offering within months, another sign that the market for high-tech companies is heating up. 

The Mountain View, Calif., company, whose members include more than 85 million business professionals, will likely file its S-1 registration statement during the first quarter, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The three underwriters are Bank of America Merrill Lynch, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley, this person said. 

The decision was made in the fourth quarter of 2010, before news of the Facebook deal surfaced earlier this week. 

"Anybody who is suggesting timing is a function of Facebook misses the point completely," a person familiar with the matter said. LinkedIn made the decision "well before the Facebook news. This has been in the works for months," the person said.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and a Russian company stunned Wall Street earlier this week with plans to invest $500 million in Facebook, the privately held social networking giant. Goldman will use a so-called special purchase vehicle to raise and invest $1.5 billion in the companyâ€”a move that has drawn the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

The agency is looking into whether Facebook may be using the special purpose vehicle to skirt laws that limit the number of shareholders in a private company. Facebook and Goldman have declined to comment. 

"We do not have a comment on speculation," a spokesman for LinkedIn said. "An IPO is but one of the many tactics we could consider. Our main focus is on growing the business and adding long-term value to our members and our shareholders."

News of the initial public offering was first reported by Reuters.
