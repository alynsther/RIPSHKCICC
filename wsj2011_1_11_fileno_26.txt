NEW YORKâ€”Stocks rose as worries over euro-zone debt eased, although a shaky start to the earnings season limited the climb. 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 34.43 points, or 0.30%, to 11671.88.  Hewlett-Packard

Tuesday's stock gains came as investors were encouraged to see the European Central Bank step in to buy under-pressure euro-area government bonds for the second consecutive day. Also, Japanese Finance Minister  Yoshihiko Noda said Tokyo may buy more than 20% of the securities issued by the European Financial Stability Facility in its initial round. The announcement follows reports that China is ready to buy 4 billion euros to 5 billion euros of Portuguese debt.

"The news today was good in that it's not just the Europeans on their own that are dealing with it, that there are other nations in the world -- the Japanese today -- that realize it's not in their interest to have this situation get worse," said  Aaron Gurwitz, chief investment officer at Barclays Wealth. "It looks like Europe will manage to muddle through these problems." 

Earlier in the session, U.S. stock indexes had been up more on the easing euro-zone concerns. Traders said stocks pared their gains in part because investors began getting jittery about leaving some of their bigger bets in the market ahead of an expected snowstorm. 

"People are just taking profits because they're not going to come in tomorrow," said Dave Rovelli, managing director of U.S. Equity Trading at Canaccord Adams.

  Talbots lost 17%. The women's retailer reduced its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings estimate on worse-than-expected preliminary sales figures, owing to a dropoff that began in the second half of December.
