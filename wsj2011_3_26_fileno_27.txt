Spring was in the air one recent Saturday morning, but inside Ditch Plains summer had already arrived.

The popular downtown hangout, named after chef and owner Marc Murphy's favorite surf spot in Montauk, recently opened its doors on the Upper West Side. The theme again is a day at the beach. A red surf board hangs on one wall, a blue wave is painted on another, and fast-pumping surf music alternates with oozing reggae. Booths are roomy and the front dining room grabs sunlight. 

Like Landmarc at the Time Warner Center, another Murphy brunch destination, Ditch Plains is kid-friendly, with room for strollers and an extensive children's menu that includes sloppy Joes and quesadilla.

The adult menu isn't much more adventurous. Try the sweet—chocolate-chip pancakes, French toast—over the savory; the thick bacon was salty and the egg sandwich a bit bland. And don't be afraid to order the signature lobster roll, even though it's not on the brunch menu.

 Ditch Plains, 100 West 82nd St., serves brunch Saturday and Sunday from 9:00 am to 4:00 pm. 212-362-4815.
