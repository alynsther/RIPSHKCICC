The silver bubble is suffering repeated jabs in New York. But the bigger threat lies in Washington.

Having almost doubled in price in six months, silver has slipped 12% this week, as Comex raised trading margins on silver contracts for the third time in two weeks.

Comex had good reason to act. The silver price has gone vertical, and volatility has soared. In any case, as a percentage of the silver contract's notional value, the margin requirement for a Comex member has risen from 3.8% to 4.9%; it's hardly that onerous, unless one is making highly leveraged bets.

The oft-cited gold/silver ratio has clearly departed from its historical average. Even at its current, post-slip 35 times, it is a long way from the average of 62 over the decade ending in 2010. Silver's rally also started later, suggesting investors locked in prior gold gains and then pushed into silver's smaller, less-familiar market.

But there may be a bigger force at work. Precious metals display an inverse correlation with real interest rates, as approximated by the yield on inflation-protected Treasurys, known as TIPS. As real rates fall, so does the opportunity cost of holding metals, which yield nothing and have to be stored at the owner's expense, instead of cash.

Gold, but especially silver, really took off last summer as expectations of another round of quantitative easing, or QE, by the Federal Reserve built and were then confirmed. The real rate using five-year TIPS dropped from about 1.3% in August to negative territory in January. Since then, it has hovered around zero.

Another leg down in real rates would help sustain silver. But with QE's demise slated for next month, the more likely outcome is rising real rates. That, more than any margin call, will prick the silver bubbleâ€”and hurt gold, too.
