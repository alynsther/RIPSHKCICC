PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla.â€”Mets right fielder Carlos Beltran will remain out of Grapefruit League games for at least another four to five days because of tendinitis in his left knee, the team said Tuesday.

Beltran said the injury was caused by putting too much stress on the left knee as he worked to regain full mobility in his arthritic right knee. He will take anti-inflammatory medication for the next several days.

Beltran said he has felt no pain in his right knee, which has been his primary concern, and still expects to be ready for Opening Day. But even if it proves to be only a minor injury, the left knee tendinitis will further delay Beltran's transition from center to right field.

His only appearance in a game this spring was Sunday, when he started at designated hitter. Now, even if he begins playing right field sometime next week, that still will leave him less than three weeks to adjust to the position.

Beltran said he began feeling pain in his left knee not long after he reported to camp. Since then, it has only gotten worse. He said he can continue to take batting practice and ride a stationary bike. But until Beltran tests his knees by playing the field and running the bases at full speed, it will be difficult for the Mets to know what to expect from him this season.
