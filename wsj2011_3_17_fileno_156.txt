Situated in San Francisco's up-and-coming Dogpatch neighborhood, Serpentine serves New American cuisine amid the area's design shops and light industry.

Serpentine—owned by  Erin Rooney, who also owns Slow Club in the Mission District—has a regularly changing menu based on seasonal ingredients from several farms and ranches in the region, as well as a full bar with spirits from small-batch distilleries.

Ms. Rooney opened Serpentine in December 2007 at the outset of the recession. She said the downturn prompted her to keep the menu "concise," with entrees for $10 to $12, and operate with a lean but experienced staff.

Now, business is recovering, and development in the Dogpatch, located between Potrero Hill and the city's eastern waterfront, is providing a lift.

"In just three years, already we've seen the neighborhood change a lot," Ms. Rooney said. "It's exciting to be in on the ground floor."

James Sain, an advertising broker, recently ate lunch at Serpentine to celebrate his 50th birthday. Mr. Sain said the food was "delicious" and praised the service but found the menu somewhat limited. "There weren't enough choices," said Mr. Sain, who ordered a beef brisket sandwich for $10.50. 

Menu staples include savory bread pudding, recently served with Gruyère cheese, roasted carrots and caramelized onions, for $10.50, and a hamburger made with beef from Northern California's Prather Ranch, for $11.50.

Serpentine, at 2495 Third St. in San Francisco, serves lunch from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., Monday through Friday.
