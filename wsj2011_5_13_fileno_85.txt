"All in the Family" broke ground in the 1970s by taking on sensitive topics like race, prejudice and politics. For this final season that ran from 1978 to 1979, the kids (played by Rob Reiner and Sally Struthers) have moved out but the Bunkers are quickly parents again when Edith's cousin leaves his 9-year-old at their door. 

Doctor to the Hamptons Hank Lawson (Mark Feuerstein), deals with the woes of the wealthy: His love interest, Jill, gets a venomous spider bite on a golf course; a winemaker has issues with her palate. In the second season, Dr. Lawson's obnoxious, estranged father (Henry Winkler) shows up and quickly adopts the Hamptons lifestyle. The third season premieres on USA on June 29. 

This three-part BBC period piece is based on the 1936 novel by Winifred Holtby about Sarah Burton (Anna Maxwell Martin), whose fiancé was killed during World War I. She moves from London to her fictional hometown of South Riding to be the headmistress at a high school for girls, and forms a complicated relationship with a fellow local, Robert Carne, who has moved back after losing his wealth. This month, the piece premiered on PBS's "Masterpiece Classic"; the final installment will play on PBS this Sunday.
