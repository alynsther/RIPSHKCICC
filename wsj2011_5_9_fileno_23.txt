Stocks climbed Monday as commodity prices recovered from last week's slump and a burst of deal activity helped overshadow concerns over Greek finances.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 45.94 points, or 0.4%, to 12684.68. Boosting the measure,  McDonald's

The Nasdaq Composite advanced 15.69, or 0.6%, to 2843.25. 

The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 6.09, or 0.5%, to 1346.29, led by its energy sector. 

Helping boost energy stocks, commodity prices rose after plunging sharply last week. Crude-oil prices settled up $5.37, or 5.5%, at $102.55 a barrel.  Chevron

Traders said the uptick in commodity prices appeared to be luring back into riskier assets those investors who may have been spooked by last week's volatility. 

"It's basically a risk-back-on day," said  Steve Sosnick, equity-risk manager at Timber Hill/Interactive Brokers Group. "All the stuff that got beaten up last week is going in the other direction." 

Deal activity helped shore up investor sentiment on Monday. Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group shares rallied 9.58, or 14%, to 79.27, after  Hertz Global Holdings

 offered to buy the car-rental company in a deal valued at $2.36 billion in cash and stockâ€”a substantially bigger offer than one the target's shareholders spurned last year. Shares of Hertz slipped 17 cents, or 1%, to 16.68.

 climbed 72 cents, or 5%, to 15.19, after saying it would buy a drug-technology unit of Irish drug maker Elan in a cash-and-stock deal valued at $960 million. 

Investors said the market was still getting a boost from Friday's government nonfarm payrolls report, which showed that employers added 244,000 jobs last month.

"We've still got the glow from Friday's payrolls report," said  Bill Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Wealth Management. "It is what people are rightly watching. In our opinion, it is the most important factor in the end in determining whether we do indeed have a self-sustaining economic recovery."

In less-encouraging U.S. economic data, home values in the first quarter posted the largest decline since late 2008, according to data released Monday by real-estate website Zillow.com. Home values fell 3% in the first quarter from the previous quarter and 1.1% in March from the previous month, pushed down by an abundance of foreclosed homes on the market. 

Meanwhile, concerns over Greece's debt burden mounted again in Europe after ratings company Standard & Poor's cut Greece's long-term credit rating to single-B from double-B-minus. S&P said the downgrade reflects the increasing likelihood that Greece's official creditors, led by the German government, may soon force private bondholders to accept an extension on Greek debt repayments coming due in the next few years.
