The bright lights and restaurant hawkers of the East Village's Curry Row tend to overshadow Sigiri, the lone Sri Lankan restaurant among the many Indian eateries. But the five-year-old establishment—named after the famed Lion Rock fortress in central Sri Lanka—holds its own, attracting a predominantly South Indian and Sri Lankan clientele.

Sigiri's weekday lunch special of rice, three vegetable curries, a lentil curry, and a choice of chicken, beef, pork, fish or prawns ($7.50-$8.50) is easy on the wallet. Try the kotthu roti—a popular late-night meal eaten along the streets of Colombo—made of shredded roti, vegetables, egg, and beef or chicken ($12.50). 

Or dine like a member of Sri Lanka's Dutch Burgher community and opt for the lamprais (pronounced "lumprise"). Baked in a banana leaf, the dish ($14.50) consists of flavored rice, mixed meats, ash plantains, eggplant and other ingredients that blend harmoniously.

Diners can request the level of spiciness in any dish, but be advised: "It's not an Americanized spice level," said manager Chelaka  Gunamuni Desilva. 

To cool off those taste buds, end the meal with the hard-to-find watalappam ($6), a coconut-milk pudding infused with cinnamon, cloves, cardamom and nutmeg. Warning: This popular treat frequently sells out.

 Sigiri, 91 First Ave., serves lunch from 12:30 to 3:30 p.m. daily, 212-614-9333.
