The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell short again of closing above 12000, as mixed economic data and corporate earnings left the market struggling to find direction.

The Dow closed at 11989.83, up 4.39 points, or less than 0.1%. It was the highest close since June 19, 2008, when the average last surpassed 12000.

The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 15.78, or 0.6% to 2755.28. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index flickered over 1300, but closed at 1299.54, up 2.91, or 0.2%. It was the highest close since Aug. 28, 2008, when it last finished above 1300.

The indexes traded within a tight range as data that were "particularly contradictory" left investors unsure of the economy's trajectory, said  David Katz, principal and senior portfolio strategist at WeiserMazars. "What's paramount is the confluence of fighting this immensely high level of unemployment and how that goes hand in hand with the housing market."

Thursday's pairing of a better-than-expected reading of pending sales of existing homes, coupled with a surprisingly large jump in jobless claims didn't add clarity to the economic outlook, he said. 

Orders for goods expected to last at least three years fell and a reading of manufacturing activity in the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City's district slowed sharply in January.

"The recovery is still tenuous," said  Tim Evnin, equity portfolio manager at Evercore Wealth Management. "It's getting better, but it's uneven and not unequivocally on a high trajectory." Corporate earnings show the same "selective rebound," he said. 

Earnings from a batch of bellwether consumer companies and a pair of drug makers got a mixed reaction in the market.

 Corrections & Amplifications  A previous version of this article misattributed Procter & Gamble's fiscal third-quarter earnings outlook to Colgate Palmolive. Procter & Gamble forecast fiscal third-quarter earnings of 95 cents to $1 a share. Analysts project 99 cents. The story also misstated that commodity prices hurt Colgate's earnings. Colgate expects greater pressure from commodities, but plans to improve margins, by raising prices and cutting costs.
