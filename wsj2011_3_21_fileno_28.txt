MUMBAI --ETHL Communications Holdings Ltd has decided to exercise its right to prepay outstanding bonds worth 42.30 billion rupees($941.89 million), and free the 10.97% stake it holds in parent Essar Group's joint venture with Vodafone Group PLC, the company said on Monday.

The bonds, sold in January 2010 in two tranches of 21.15 billion rupees each and maturing in July and December 2011, respectively, were backed by the 10.97% stake that ETHL holds in Vodafone Essar Ltd.

Vodafone Group owns about 67% of Vodafone Essar, India's third-largest mobile phone operator by subscribers, while Essar Group companies own most of the remaining 33%.

The prepayment comes more than a month after Essar and Vodafone appointed three investment bankers to value the Indian conglomerate's stake in the local telecom operator in a bid to resolve a dispute over Essar's exit from the joint venture that was formed in 2007.

Vodafone has a pact with Essar that gives the Indian group a put option for its stake, which it can sell to the U.K. company for $5 billion between the third and fourth years of the deal's completion. The put option effectively expires on May 8, 2011, but the two partners are embroiled in a spat over the value Vodafone must pay if Essar exercises the option.
