NEW DELHI â€“ India's coal output will grow 7%-8% next financial year, which starts on April 1, Coal Minister Sriprakash Jaiswal said Tuesday. 

In December, the minister said the country's coal production target for the current financial year was 572.37 million metric tons. 

Mr. Jaiswal also said the ongoing nuclear crisis in Japan will have an impact on prices and supply in the global coal market short-term. 

"Right now, negative sentiments have developed on nuclear energy after the Japanese crisis. In the long-run, nuclear energy is important, but right now there will be pressure on coal," Mr. Jaiswal said. 

The earthquake and subsequent tsunami in Japan led to the shutdown of several of the country's nuclear power plants. The resulting power shortage is expected to be made up through fossil fuel-based power plants short-term, the bulk of which will be imported from global coal markets.
