 affiliate, continued profit growth at its property unit, and revaluation gains on investment properties. 

The blue-chip conglomerate, whose operations include properties, aviation and beverages, said its net profit for the 12 months ended Dec. 31 rose to 38.25 billion Hong Kong dollars (US$4.91 billion) from HK$21.89 billion. 

Underlying profit, which strips out items including revaluation of properties, rose 90% to HK$16.14 billion in 2010 from HK$8.48 billion. 

Revenue rose 17% to HK$29.2 billion from HK$24.9 billion in 2009. 

Net profit contribution from the conglomerate's 42.97%-owned Cathay Pacific surged to HK$5.08 billion in 2010, nearly four times the HK$1.35 billion in 2009, driven by robust demand for passenger and cargo services, especially for air traffic originating from Hong Kong.

However, Chairman  Christopher Pratt said in a statement the rapid turnaround in Cathay's business from the lows of 2008—when the global financial crisis began unfolding—was "indicative of the volatile nature of the aviation business." 

"The results of airlines would be adversely affected, and very quickly so, by a return to recessionary economic conditions," Mr. Pratt said, adding that Cathay's profit could weaken if oil prices continue to rise. 

Light, sweet crude futures for April delivery traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose to a more-than two-year high Monday and have been hovering above US$100 a barrel. 

Swire Pacific said its gross rental income from office and retail space rose 6% to HK$7.84 billion in 2010 from HK$7.39 billion, reflecting continued recovery in Hong Kong's property market. 

The company, whose key investment properties include the Pacific Place and Quarry Bay complexes on Hong Kong Island, posted a 48% increase in revaluation gains on investment properties to HK$21.34 billion from HK$14.41 billion in 2009. 

"Against a background of continuing economic growth in mainland China and Hong Kong, the trading environment for the group's principal retail and office developments remains strong," Mr. Pratt said. 

The group said its property unit,  Swire Properties Ltd., will have a rental portfolio of 15.3 million square feet in Hong Kong and 8.6 million square feet in mainland China when current developments are completed. Swire Properties also has property interests in the U.S. and the UK. 

The conglomerate said its beverage division recorded a 7% decrease in attributable profit to HK$699 million, due to a significant rise in raw material costs and stronger competition in China. 

The company recommended a final dividend of HK$2.50 per Hong Kong-listed A share, up from HK$2.20 the previous year. Its final dividend per Hong Kong-listed B share was HK$0.50, up from HK$0.44 in 2009. 

In May, Swire Pacific shelved a plan to spin off Swire Properties in a Hong Kong initial public offering that could have raised as much as US$3.09 billion, citing a "sharp deterioration in market sentiment."
