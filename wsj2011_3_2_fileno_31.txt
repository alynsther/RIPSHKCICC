 said net profit fell 9.7% in 2010 because of one-time gains increased earnings the year before, though its local and overseas operations remained strong. 

Chairman  Victor Li said the company will continue to seek investments overseas to strengthen its portfolio. CKI, controlled by  Li Ka-shing, has been expanding overseas in the past few years to broaden its earnings base because of the difficulties in expanding in Hong Kong's mature electricity market. The firm has more than five billion Hong Kong dollars, or about US$640 million, in cash on hand to finance deals. 

"Currently, we have a good deal flow and are vigorously pursuing other investment opportunities in different sectors around the world," Mr. Li said in a statement Wednesday. "A number of exciting new projects are now under study." 

Net profit for the 12 months ended Dec. 31 fell to HK$5.03 billion from HK$5.57 billion the previous year. The result was above the average HK$4.88 billion forecast of eight analysts polled earlier by Thomson Reuters. 

Revenue rose 29% to HK$2.81 billion from HK$2.18 billion. The company proposed a final dividend of HK$1.00, up from 88 Hong Kong cents a year earlier. 

CKI has investments in Hong Kong, mainland China, Australia, the U.K., Canada, the Philippines, and New Zealand. Its businesses range from electricity generation to water and natural-gas supplies.

, in which CKI has a 39% stake, rose 7% to HK$2.77 billion from HK$2.58 billion, and accounted for 55% of the company's earnings. 

Power Assets, which changed its name from Hongkong Electric Holdings Ltd. in February, said its 2010 net profit rose 7.4% to HK$7.19 billion from HK$6.70 billion, driven by higher contributions from overseas businesses. 

CKI's net profit from the U.K.—the company's second-largest market after Hong Kong—nearly doubled to HK$1.18 billion from HK$616 million, driven by the electricity assets it acquired last year. In October, a consortium led by CKI and Power Assets bought Electricité de France SA's U.K. electricity distribution networks for £5.78 billion (US$9.39 billion). 

In May, CKI also bought a 50% stake in Seabank Power Station, a 1,140-megawatt gas-fired power station near Bristol in the U.K., for HK$2.4 billion. It now owns a 25% stake in Seabank Power after it sold half of its interest to Power Assets for HK$1.2 billion in June. 

Power Assets said in February it was considering a bid for German utility  E.ON AG's U.K. electricity distribution business, the U.K.'s second-largest electricity generator and its second-largest distribution network. However, E.ON on Wednesday agreed to sell its U.K. power business to the U.S.'s  PPL Corp.

 for £4 billion. 

Mr. Li didn't comment on the E.ON deal. 

Contributions from CKI's Australia operations rose 27% in 2010 to HK$1.03 billion from HK$805 million a year earlier due to strong growth in the firm's electricity-distribution business, the company said. 

However, net profit from China dropped 79% to HK$374 million last year from HK$1.74 billion a year earlier, because CKI sold power plants on the mainland to Power Assets Holdings last year.
