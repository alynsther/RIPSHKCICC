To get to the Final Four, it helps to have chemistry, tradition, a brilliant coach and the right matchups. But don't kid yourself. What a team really needs is NBA talent.

It's incredibly rare for a team to reach college basketball's promised land without a single pro-caliber player. Of the 96 teams that reached the Final Four between 1985—the year the tournament expanded to 64 teams—and 2008, 94 had at least one player who eventually appeared in an NBA game. (We left aside the 2009 and 2010 Final Four participants, since several of their key players are still in school.) The two exceptions: Oklahoma in 2002 and George Mason, the patron saint of underdogs, in 2006.

In fact, having a single future NBA player is usually not enough: 91% of all Final Four teams over this span have had at least two and the majority of teams had at least four. The outrageously talented 1996 Kentucky Wildcats had nine, including 13-year NBA veteran Nazr Mohammed, who seldom played that season. Among the few that had just one future NBA player were Florida (Andrew DeClercq) in 1994, Oklahoma State (Bryant "Big Country" Reeves) in 1995 and Syracuse (John Wallace) and Massachusetts (Marcus Camby) in 1996.

Given this, there's all the more reason to expect top seeds Ohio State and Kansas to get to Houston. Both have at least four draft-quality players apiece.
