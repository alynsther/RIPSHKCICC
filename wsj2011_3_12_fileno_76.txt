Carmelo Anthony's detractors say he's a shot taker, not a shot maker. But since his arrival in New York, the attention he commands from defenses seems to be making it easier for his teammates to find the net.

While Anthony is hitting a subpar 45% of his field goals since joining the Knicks, the non-Anthony Knicks are shooting 48.2%. That would be second best behind Boston in the full-season rankings. Prior to Anthony's arrival, the Knicks shot just under 46%, about average.

Looking more deeply at the Knicks regulars who now benefit from playing with Anthony, we see improvement nearly across the board. Amar'e Stoudemire, Toney Douglas, Landry Fields and Shawne Williams collectively shot 51.3% from the field post-trade versus 48% prior to Anthony's arrival. Douglas has benefited most, improving from well below average as a shooter to well above. 

Most startling is his dramatic improvement in converting two-point attempts. Only Williams has declined, but he plays the most minutes of this quartet while Anthony is on the bench—a little more than 40% of his post-trade allotment.

Anthony's Knicks continue to be plagued by poor defense and rebounding. They remain severely undersized due to lacking a center who can contribute on either end of the court. But even after Thursday night's loss in Dallas, they appear to be a far more dangerous team than they were prior to Anthony's arrival. Against winning teams, they are 5-2 overall and 3-2 on the road. Compare this to their 11-18 overall and 4-10 road record against winning teams prior to the trade. Best of all, New York has 19 remaining regular-season games to become even more acquainted with the holes Anthony creates in opposing defenses.
