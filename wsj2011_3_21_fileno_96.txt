David Clarkson scored twice and Martin Brodeur made 13 saves to earn his NHL-record 115th shutout as the New Jersey Devils snapped a two-game slide with a victory over the Columbus Blue Jackets on Sunday. Nick Palmieri also scored, and Mattias Tedenby added two assists for the Devils, who are trying to stay in the Eastern Conference playoff race. New Jersey is in 11th place and began the day eight points below the postseason cutoff. The Devils, who have 10 games left, were on a 23-3-2 tear before back-to-back losses to Ottawa and Washington this week.
