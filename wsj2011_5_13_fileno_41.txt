Lately there's been a rash of Twitter controversies involving professional athletes. Seems like hardly a day passes that a jock doesn't step into trouble by pecking out an opinion in 140 characters or less, infuriating teammates, fans, and especially talk-radio hosts with hours and hours of air time to fill. Some folks argue that athletes should avoid Twitter altogether for risk of losing credibility or endorsements or giving people the impression they have internal lives and think about subjects other than sports.

What if there were a sports place on Twitter where nothing controversial happened? A place where the judgment was solid, nothing offensive was said, no out-of-school tales were told and the language was G-rated? What if there were an athlete on Twitter you could proudly introduce to your children? What if someone like Derek Jeter had a Twitter account?
