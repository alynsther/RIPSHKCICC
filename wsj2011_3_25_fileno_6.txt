Former Islander Rob Schremp scored the winning goal against his former team as the Atlanta Thrashers beat New York on Thursday night at Nassau Coliseum.

John Tavares, notching his 27th goal of the season, was the only Islander who could beat Atlanta backup goalie Chris Mason. Al Montoya made 32 saves for the Islanders.

Andrew Ladd scored the first goal for Atlanta, while Mason only needed to make 14 saves.

The Thrashers dominated the opening periods, outshooting the Isles 12 to three in the first and 16 to four in the second, and if it weren't for the solid play by Montoya, the Islanders would have likely been scored on more than twice.
