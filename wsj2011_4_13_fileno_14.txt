San Francisco's Board of Supervisors late Tuesday approved an ordinance that will exclude online messaging service Twitter Inc. and certain other businesses from paying a 1.5% city payroll tax for the next six years.

The move paves the way for fast-growing Twitter to move to a new location in San Francisco's Central Market area, which has been "burdened with high vacancies and blight for decades," according to a statement by San Francisco Mayor Edwin Lee.

The ordinance is aimed at encouraging development in what are called the Mid-Market and Tenderloin neighborhoods and doesn't apply to companies in other areas.

Twitter is currently located in the city's South of Market area but had considered moving out of San Francisco partly because of the city payroll tax, according to a city report issued last month.

"I would also like to thank Twitter for making a commitment to remain in San Francisco and for their enthusiasm about joining our broad-based effort to revitalize Central Market and the Tenderloin," Mayor Lee said in a statement. "This new partnership with Twitter represents just one example of how the City can work collaboratively with businesses, community-based organizations, property owners, and area residents to catalyze meaningful change in this neighborhood."

A Twitter spokesman said the company would issue a statement Wednesday.

For the ordinance to take effect, the Board of Supervisors must approve it again in a second vote, according to its website.

Twitter, which allows people to broadcast messages of 140 characters or less in length, was created in 2006. It is aggressively hiring and currently has more than 450 employees. The company was valued at around $4 billion last year in a financing.
