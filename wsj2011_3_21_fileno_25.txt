LONDON—Telecommunications stocks led European markets higher as investors weighed the potential for deals in the industry. News of progress in Japan's efforts to bring a damaged nuclear power plant under control helped stocks rebound from losses last week.

The Stoxx Europe 600 index closed up 1.8% at 272.33. 

  Justin Urquhart Stewart, co-founder of Seven Investment Management, took a cautious stance on the rally. "Any of the risks you thought were there on Friday, are still there on Monday," he said. "The Japanese issues may have become slightly less immediately dangerous,"

Deutsche Telekom has agreed to sell its T-Mobile U.S. unit to AT&T Inc. in a $39 billion cash and stock deal. The news pushed Deutsche Telekom's shares up 11%, while the Stoxx Europe 600 index for the sector added 3.7% to 278.27. 

The U.K.'s FTSE 100 index rose 1.2% to 5786.09, marking its third straight gain. Germany's DAX rose 2.3% to 6816.12 and France's CAC 40 gained 2.5% to 3904.45.

London-listed mobile operator Vodafone rose 3.6% on prospects for consolidation in the sector. Shares of France Telecom gained 3.5%.

 added 2.2%. The Stoxx Europe 600 insurance index rose 2.5% to 167.15. 

Investors welcomed news from Japan, where leaders voiced optimism that the worst of the nuclear crisis is over, raising hopes that the stricken Fukushima Daiichi plant's cooling systems can be restored.

Shares of Electricité de France rose 5.2%. Over the weekend, EDF Energy's chief executive officer,  Vincent de Rivaz, said that the company's plans for U.K. nuclear power plants will proceed despite the crisis in Japan. Shares of EDF have been hard-hit in the wake of that crisis.

Meanwhile, shares of German truck maker MAN rose 3.6%, after the company reported a fourth-quarter net profit of €342 million ($484 million), compared to a year-earlier loss of €472 million. 

Shares of luxury-goods makers across Europe bounced back as investors became less fearful that Japan's crisis will leave consumers there with less money to spend. 

Shares of Burberry Group rose 2.9% in London, while in Paris, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA gained 3.3%.

In Switzerland, shares of Swatch Group rose 3.3%, while Compagnie Financiere Richemont gained 3.2%.

Despite the strong gains, tensions in Libya and the Middle East remained a concern, as the U.S. and its allies launched airstrikes against Libya. "This is another episode that could possibly be translated into risk-off trades and market nervousness," said a note from Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets. 

"It is noteworthy that the UN's reaction in support of the Libyan anti-government protestors could have wider implications. Similar anti-government sentiments could be possibly expressed more openly now, especially at bigger oil-producing states in the region, with significant implications on oil prices, inflation and possibly global growth," it added.

The Libya news sent oil prices higher. Late afternoon in London, oil for April delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange was up $1.40 at $102.47 per barrel. 

In the U.S., data showed sales of previously occupied homes fell 9.6% to 4.88 million units in February, while the January total was revised to 5.40 million units. The outcome was weaker than expected. 

In the foreign-exchange markets, the yen weakened as traders weighed the prospect of further efforts to keep the currency in check by central banks from the Group of Seven industrialized countries. The yen slipped even though the currency, usually seen as a haven, was supported by the fighting in Libya.

In late afternoon, the dollar was at ¥81.13, up from ¥80.76 in late New York trading on Friday. The euro was at ¥115.03, up from ¥114.69, and at $1.4177, compared with $1.4168. 

Spot gold was at $1431.80 per troy ounce, up $15.70 from its level in New York on Friday.
