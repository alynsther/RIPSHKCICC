European golf's annual Race to Dubai begins in earnest at the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship on Thursday, roughly 70 miles from where it will conclude in 11 months' time.

The courses in the Middle East share a number of characteristics, specifically long, open layouts and wide fairways. Which means the four-tournament Gulf swing is usually dominated by the European Tour's biggest hitters. This year should be no different.

Martin Kaymer, the current Race to Dubai champion, has won twice here in 2008 and 2010, and is tough to ignore this time around after a season in which he won his first major at the U.S. PGA Championship. Oddsmakers offer just 8/1 for Mr. Kaymer to win here, but at such a short price, there are more tempting options.

Álvaro Quirós, a slugger from Spain, performs well in this part of the world: He finished 11th at the Abu Dhabi course last year, but followed up with a second at the Qatar Masters and a sixth-place finish in the Dubai Desert Classic. 

His season finished on a high, again in the desert, with a 13-under-par third place at the Dubai World Championship. Back Mr. Quirós each-way at 40/1 with Paddy Power, Stan James or Coral.

Rory McIlroy also appeals here due to his steady improvement in this tournament. He was 11th in 2008, fifth in 2009 and third in 2010, and would could improve further as he bids to start 2011 with a bang. Instead of taking the 11/1 for Mr. McIlroy to win, consider selling his finishing position at 19 with Sporting Index.
