Yankee manager Joe Girardi will make a radio appearance on Mike Francesa's show on 660 WFAN-AM before roughly half the Yankees' games this year, according to WFAN. 

Baseball managers often make weekly paid radio appearances on local stations, but appearances with this level of frequency are less common. Girardi had already made a weekly appearance on WFAN. He is scheduled to appear between 1:30 p.m. and 2 p.m. each time, according to the station. 

"It's going to be extremely short, really short, so I'll go do it and then go do my other duties," Girardi said. 

The radio appearance adds to an extensive list of media duties, including the Joe Girardi Show, a half-hour program that airs Sundays during the season on the YES Network.

After the NFL's owners and players association agreed last week to extend the league's Collective Bargaining Agreement by seven days to try to avoid a work stoppage, Brandon Moore, one of the Jets' starting offensive guards and the team's co-alternate player representative, said in an e-mail interview that "the owners now getting involved in meetings is extremely encouraging. The extension is as well. As long as we are talking face to face and not in court."

Resurgent St. John's received two more honors Monday when the Big East named senior guard Dwight Hardy the conference's Most Improved Player and senior forward Justin Burrell the recipient of the Sixth Man Award. 

Hardy, a Bronx native, finished the regular season averaging 17.9 points, fourth-best in the league. The Bronx-born Burrell averaged 6.6 points and 5 rebounds in 21.1 minutes per game.

St. John's on Wednesday faces the winner of Tuesday's Seton Hall-Rutgers game in the second round of the Big East Tournament.
