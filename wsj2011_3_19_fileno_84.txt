  Trey Parker and  Matt Stone, the creators of "South Park," are known for their provocative irreverence. But Friday in the Pool Room at the Four Seasons, the theater and film producer  Scott Rudin and the filmmaker  Mike Nichols hosted a civilized lunch for the pair and the rest of the creative team for "The Book of Mormon," the new Broadway musical opening on Thursday at the Eugene O'Neill Theater.

Mr Rudin said he has tried to keep the marketing of the show as quiet as possible, to let people discover it themselves. Up to now there has been no televised b-roll and only a few released still photography images.

An excellent crowd showed up in support of Messrs. Stone and Parker, including the writer/director  Nora Ephron, Andy Samberg of "Saturday Night Live," actor  David Hyde Pierce and Broadway legend  Angela Lansbury. They were privy to perhaps the greatest number of F-bombs and C-words the power cafeteria has seen in some time. (Sample comments from Mr. Stone: " Ann Roth is the best f— costume designer in the world. Casey Nicholaw: what a f— director!")

Some guests were conscious of Ms. Lansbury's presence in a room with such profanity. (As for breaking boundaries in theater, Ms. Lansbury originated the role of Mrs. Lovett in "Sweeney Todd," in which she helped chop up people for meat pies.) But the actress gamely posed for photos with the cast and said she intended to see the musical Saturday night. "I'm not very easily offended," she said.
