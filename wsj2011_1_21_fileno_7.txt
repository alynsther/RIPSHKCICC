The White House's effort to reposition itself toward the center is working better than most imagined. President Obama signed a deal extending tax cuts in December and has avoided sharply partisan rhetoric. As a result, the president's poll numbers are up significantly. 

The latest NBC/Wall Street Journal poll finds that a full 40% of those surveyed see the president as moderate—a number higher than the 37% who felt that way when he was inaugurated. A separate Fox News poll out this week has similar findings.

Even more significantly, only 45% in the NBC/WSJ survey now see him as a liberal—a full 10 points below the percentage who perceived him that way last fall. The political news service Hotline calls it a "remarkable turnaround given how his leftward positioning cost his party so badly" in the 2010 midterm election.

With those kinds of numbers, watch Team Obama continue rhetorical moves to the center, such as Mr. Obama's recent Wall Street Journal op-ed questioning some outdated regulations. Just don't call it "triangulation," the term coined for Bill Clinton's famous attempt to position himself between the GOP and his party's liberals. Given that most of Mr. Obama's moves to the center don't show signs of actual changes in issue positions, perhaps the best preliminary term to describe his approach is "diversion."
