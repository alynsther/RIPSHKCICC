One reason school reform is such a long, hard slog is because unions have
learned to wait out reformers until one of their allies gets back into
political power. Witness what's unfolding now in New York City, where new
Mayor Bill de Blasio is walking back a decade of reforms and blowing out the
bank on teacher pay.

Unions refused to negotiate for five years with former mayor Michael
Bloomberg, and their refusal has paid off. Union...

CHICAGO—Willie Davis Jr. was looking to move into public housing after
bouncing from a brother's home to a health-care center for the homeless to a
transitional shelter following his release from prison over a year ago.

But the Chicago Housing Authority rejected his application for an apartment on
the city's West Side because of his criminal background, which includes his
recent prison sentence for retail theft and past convictions for burglary. So
the 62-year-old has been sleeping in a dormitory with more than two dozen...

About a quarter of the world's population agrees that a number of negative
statements about Jews are "probably true," according to a poll aimed at
providing a statistical underpinning to the question of how widespread anti-
Semitism is globally.

In the survey to be released Tuesday, which covered 101 countries plus the
Palestinian territories, 26% of respondents agreed with at least six of 11
negative statements—what its sponsor called stereotypes—about Jews. The
questions included "Jews are more loyal to...

BERLIN—Art collector Cornelius Gurlitt wrote a second will before his death
last week, a Munich court said Tuesday, though people familiar with the
document said it also designated a Swiss museum as heir to much of his art

the Kunstmuseum in Bern, Switzerland.

Top Obama administration officials are considering relaxing federal laws
banning crude-oil exports, a move that would upend decades-old policy, cause a
political stir in Washington and sway the global oil market.

U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz said Tuesday that some of the fast-growing
supply of domestically produced oil isn't suitable for refining locally, which
could warrant re-examining a nearly 40-year-old law that bans...

WASHINGTON—The military must do more to prepare for the impacts of a changing
climate, including updating war plans and building more ships to operate in
the Arctic, a report by a group of retired military officers will say
Wednesday.

The report by CNA Corp., a nonprofit research group that frequently does work

ZURICH—Switzerland will vote on Sunday on an initiative to introduce a minimum

Many Swiss workers "battle to make ends meet," said Daniel Lampart, chief

Last Friday, Miami Marlins ace Jose Fernandez had one of the worst outings of
his career, allowing six runs in five innings in a loss to the San Diego
Padres. However, Fernandez had a pretty good excuse: he was battling
discomfort from a tear of the ulnar collateral ligament in his elbow.

The 21-year-old Fernandez, last year's National League Rookie of the Year,
will likely be the latest pitcher to undergo Tommy John surgery. But the
question remains: Will Fernandez be the same pitcher when he returns in 2015?

Although the average recovery time for a pitcher requiring Tommy John surgery
is 12 to 18 months, research from Detroit's Henry Ford Hospital has shown that
80% of major-league pitchers who have the surgery do return to the big
leagues. Most also get back to a level of performance not far off from what
they were before the surgery.

CT997_COUNT0_G_20140513221851.jpg) ENLARGE

Washington Nationals ace Stephen Strasburg, for instance, was the 2010 version
of baseball's young phenom. Now several years removed from his rehabilitation,
he currently ranks second in the National League in strikeout rate, behind
only Fernandez. Looking at his adjusted fielding independent pitching, or
FIP-, which is an index stat based on walks, strikeouts and home runs allowed,
Strasburg has still been 25% better than the league average since returning
from surgery.

Pitchers like Jordan Zimmermann, Kris Medlen and Josh Johnson have performed
as well or even slightly better after the surgery than they did before. Both
Medlen and Johnson required a second Tommy John surgery this spring, however,
showing the surgery isn't a magical cure.

The elephant in the room here is the prevalence of UCL injuries in the modern
baseball era in spite of efforts to baby new talent. Somewhere something has
gone horribly wrong, and this may go all the way back to the development of
pitchers in kids' leagues.  
  
There's got to be a way to develop a robust, Nolan-Ryan-type talent. I can't
believe he was a genetic freak - even if extraordinarily talented. If you read
his bio, you'll see that his success was largely predicated on his work ethic
off the mound. And unless I'm mistaken, he wasn't throwing in year-round
leagues as a child.

Just a few seconds before California Chrome won the Kentucky Derby, jockey
Victor Espinoza pumped a celebratory fist in the air and let the horse cross
the finish line on his own momentum.

"I stopped riding him a little before the wire. I knew I was in front,"
Espinoza said.

It was a gesture of jockey bravado, for sure, but it allowed California Chrome
to do what he couldn't have done on his own: save a little energy for the
grueling Triple Crown quest ahead.

Saturday's Preakness Stakes (4:30 p.m. ET, NBC) at Baltimore's Pimlico Race
Course—the second jewel of the Triple Crown—will be run just two weeks after
the Derby. The Belmont Stakes is three weeks later on June 7.

The quick turnaround is partly why the Triple Crown is the ultimate test of a
champion. Since the last Triple Crown winner—Affirmed in 1978—training methods
have changed, leading many to doubt that the modern thoroughbred is equipped
to handle the challenge. Top race horses are often given at least three weeks
(or more) between races by their trainers. As creatures of habit, horses learn
a pattern of running at racing speed, then gearing up gradually to do it all
again. But a Triple Crown contender isn't aware of the concentrated calendar.
Nor does he know to conserve energy, as an Olympic runner might, for his next
race.

"Any time you don't have to let your horse completely all out, it helps," said
California Chrome's trainer  Art Sherman, who admits that Espinoza's early
celebration "got me a little nervous."

Jockeys who have campaigned previous Triple Crown contenders say easing up
when you can does have merit.

"You don't need to win by 20 [lengths]. You just need to win," said Hall of
Fame jockey Kent Desormeaux, who has twice won the first two legs of the
Triple Crown in the same year, with Real Quiet in 1998 and Big Brown in 2008.
But horses aren't like cars, he added: "There's no gas pedal and brake. If you
slow the horse down approaching the wire, he may slow down too much. It's
dangerous."

Desormeaux said his approach is to notch the win and turn the victor over to
the trainer. "I say, 'I ride him. You revive him.'"

Hall of Fame rider Gary Stevens, who in 1997 won the Derby and Preakness
aboard Silver Charm, said while the first objective is to win the race,
jockeys do so by being aware of what the horse can give and when. "A horse can
only run at top speed for a quarter mile, and it's the jockey's job to ration
that speed," he said.

Trainer Bob Baffert won the first two legs of the Triple Crown with three
different horses, Silver Charm, Real Quiet and War Emblem in 2002. The two-
week turnaround, he said, creates its own momentum: "They're in the zone.
They're peaking. Within two weeks, they can come back and give you another big
effort."

The Belmont however, presents the real challenge. "The third leg starts
catching up with them," he said.

Sherman, too, suspects California Chrome will easily cruise the Baltimore oval
as the heavy favorite. "I think the Preakness will be a lot easier on him than
the Derby," he said.

The Preakness is 1/16th of a mile shorter than the Derby, but it is the
smaller field size that gives Sherman confidence: The Preakness is slated to
have 10 runners, whereas the Derby had 19.

If California Chrome wins on Saturday, he will head to New York shortly
thereafter where he'll be pampered and trained lightly. "We'll let him be a
horse. We just have to hope he's got enough umph in him left to go that far,"
said Sherman of the Belmont's 1 ½-mile distance, the longest of the three
Triple Crown legs.

As for Espinoza, he has been down this road before. Espinoza rode War Emblem
to wins in the Derby and Preakness. "I was really confident to go to the
Preakness," said Espinoza of War Emblem. "He went so easy in the Derby."

But he's not getting ahead of himself: "I will worry about the Belmont after
the Preakness."

Sherman does not like the idea of running horses back in two weeks. He may be
easily the best this week but the Belmont is doubtful.

JOHANNESBURG—Five fast-growing African economies lost about $15 billion in tax

Just a few seconds before California Chrome won the Kentucky Derby, jockey
Victor Espinoza pumped a celebratory fist in the air and let the horse cross
the finish line on his own momentum.

"I stopped riding him a little before the wire. I knew I was in front,"
Espinoza said.

It was a gesture of jockey bravado, for sure, but it allowed California Chrome
to do what he couldn't have done on his own: save a little energy for the
grueling Triple Crown quest ahead.

Can Kentucky Derby winner California Chrome win at Pimlico? Pia Catton
previews the 139th Preakness Stakes. Photo: Getty.

Saturday's Preakness Stakes (4:30 p.m. ET, NBC) at Baltimore's Pimlico Race
Course—the second jewel of the Triple Crown—will be run just two weeks after
the Derby. The Belmont Stakes is three weeks later on June 7.

The quick turnaround is partly why the Triple Crown is the ultimate test of a
champion. Since the last Triple Crown winner—Affirmed in 1978—training methods
have changed, leading many to doubt that the modern thoroughbred is equipped
to handle the challenge. Top race horses are often given at least three weeks
(or more) between races by their trainers. As creatures of habit, horses learn
a pattern of running at racing speed, then gearing up gradually to do it all
again. But a Triple Crown contender isn't aware of the concentrated calendar.
Nor does he know to conserve energy, as an Olympic runner might, for his next
race.

"Any time you don't have to let your horse completely all out, it helps," said
California Chrome's trainer  Art Sherman, who admits that Espinoza's early
celebration "got me a little nervous."

Jockeys who have campaigned previous Triple Crown contenders say easing up
when you can does have merit.

"You don't need to win by 20 [lengths]. You just need to win," said Hall of
Fame jockey Kent Desormeaux, who has twice won the first two legs of the
Triple Crown in the same year, with Real Quiet in 1998 and Big Brown in 2008.
But horses aren't like cars, he added: "There's no gas pedal and brake. If you
slow the horse down approaching the wire, he may slow down too much. It's
dangerous."

Desormeaux said his approach is to notch the win and turn the victor over to
the trainer. "I say, 'I ride him. You revive him.'"

Hall of Fame rider Gary Stevens, who in 1997 won the Derby and Preakness
aboard Silver Charm, said while the first objective is to win the race,
jockeys do so by being aware of what the horse can give and when. "A horse can
only run at top speed for a quarter mile, and it's the jockey's job to ration
that speed," he said.

Trainer Bob Baffert won the first two legs of the Triple Crown with three
different horses, Silver Charm, Real Quiet and War Emblem in 2002. The two-
week turnaround, he said, creates its own momentum: "They're in the zone.
They're peaking. Within two weeks, they can come back and give you another big
effort."

The Belmont however, presents the real challenge. "The third leg starts
catching up with them," he said.

Sherman, too, suspects California Chrome will easily cruise the Baltimore oval
as the heavy favorite. "I think the Preakness will be a lot easier on him than
the Derby," he said.

The Preakness is 1/16th of a mile shorter than the Derby, but it is the
smaller field size that gives Sherman confidence: The Preakness is slated to
have 10 runners, whereas the Derby had 19.

If California Chrome wins on Saturday, he will head to New York shortly
thereafter where he'll be pampered and trained lightly. "We'll let him be a
horse. We just have to hope he's got enough umph in him left to go that far,"
said Sherman of the Belmont's 1 ½-mile distance, the longest of the three
Triple Crown legs.

As for Espinoza, he has been down this road before. Espinoza rode War Emblem
to wins in the Derby and Preakness. "I was really confident to go to the
Preakness," said Espinoza of War Emblem. "He went so easy in the Derby."

But he's not getting ahead of himself: "I will worry about the Belmont after
the Preakness."

Sherman does not like the idea of running horses back in two weeks. He may be
easily the best this week but the Belmont is doubtful.
