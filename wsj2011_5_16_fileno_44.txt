The technology and consumer-discretionary sectors led stocks lower as weak economic data spurred worries of a softening economy and Europe's debt crisis weighed on investor sentiment.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 47.38 points, or 0.4%, at 12548.37, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 8.30 points, or 0.6%, to 1329.47. The technology-oriented Nasdaq Composite shed 46.16 points, or 1.6%, to 2782.31, its biggest point and percentage drop since March 16.

Volume was relatively light, with 3.5 billion shares changing hands in NYSE composite volume. 

Investors said a New York-area manufacturing survey that was well below expectations underscored the uneven state of the economy, while a weak housing index showed continued stress in that market. Technology and consumer-discretionary shares are often among the first to be hit when consumers and businesses tighten their belts.

"A lot of the macro numbers we've seen over the last few weeks have shown a sedated economy. It's less robust," said  Jay Suskind, senior vice president at Duncan-Williams. Mr. Suskind said weakness in technology stocks in particular should be expected if more market participants foresee an economic soft patch.

Euro-zone debt also stayed at the forefront after the arrest of International Monetary Fund Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn on sexual-assault charges, seen as weakening the IMF's ability to resolve the euro-zone debt crisis.

Stocks in Europe and Asia were slightly lower as concerns subsided about the arrest of the IMF chief. 

In Europe, a late-session rally in the resources sector lent support. The Stoxx Europe 600 index closed down 0.1% at 280.13. France's CAC-40 index ended down 0.7% at 3989.82 and Germany's DAX fell 0.2% to 7387.54. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 index erased earlier losses to end marginally lower at 5923.69, thanks to gains in the mining sector.

In Japan, stocks continued to struggle as data showing stronger-than-expected machinery orders for March failed to offset worries about the nation's outlook following the earthquake and nuclear crisis.

In Tokyo, the Nikkei Stock Average fell 0.9% to 9558.30. In Sydney, the S&P/ASX 200 fell 1.3% to 4650. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index shed 1.4% to 22960.63. China's Shanghai Composite declined 0.8% to 2,849.07. South Korea's Kospi fell 0.8% to 2104.18.

In the U.S., regulatory hurdles prompted  Nasdaq OMX Group and IntercontinentalExchange to withdraw their bid for  NYSE Euronext. NYSE Euronext tumbled $5.16, or 13%, to $35.73, while Nasdaq's shares lost 68 cents, or 2.5%, to 26.23.

  Microsoft led the Dow index lower as it shed 46 cents, or 1.8%, to 24.57, while  Cisco Systems fell 28 cents, or 1.7%, to 16.60.  Yahoo fell 74 cents, or 4.5%, to 15.81, despite a joint statement with Chinese search firm Alibaba Group that the companies were taking steps to resolve a dispute over one of Alibaba website Alipay.

  Monster Worldwide was one of the worst performers in the Standard & Poor's 500, falling 1.35, or 8.3%, to 14.99, as some analysts said this week's looming pricing this week for website LinkedIn's initial public offering weighed on the stock. 

Lowe's dropped 92 cents, or 3.6%, to 24.84, as the home-improvement retailer reported a drop in fiscal first-quarter sales.

Foreign-exchange brokerage FXCM slid 1.99, or 17%, to 9.97, as adjusted earnings fell 7.1% on lower average daily trades.

In deal news,  Joy Global bought equipment maker LeTourneau Technologies from  Rowan Cos. for $1.1 billion, giving it access to the oil-and-gas market. Joy Global added 88 cents, or 1%, to 88.36, while Rowan shed eight cents, or 0.2%, to 37.96.

  SanDisk rose 1.46, or 3.1%, to 47.95, as the flash-memory maker agreed to acquire solid-state drive company Pliant Technology for about $327 million plus incentives, giving the company a foothold in the enterprise-storage market.

Insurance intermediary  CNinsure gained 4.16, or 32%, to 17.32, after the company said it received a $982 million nonbinding proposal to go private from a consortium led by its founder and chief executive.
