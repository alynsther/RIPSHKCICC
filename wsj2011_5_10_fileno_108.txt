If the intentional walk is baseball's ultimate sign of respect, then where does Royals rookie Eric Hosmer go from here? On Saturday, in the first baseman's second major-league game, A's manager Bob Geren called on Brandon McCarthy to walk Hosmer to set up a force play. That was the earliest intentional pass since Braves catcher Brian McCann got one in his second big-league plate appearance in 2005.

Cyclist Wouter Weylandt, a 26-year-old Belgian, died Monday from injuries sustained in a crash during the third stage of the Giro d'Italia, in northern Italy. The Giro, one of cycling's three Grand Tours, is known for its treacherous roads and bad crashes, and the death of Weylandt (pictured in 2007) is the fourth in the race since the 1950s. The cause of Monday's crash wasn't known.
