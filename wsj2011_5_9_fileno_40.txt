NEW DELHI -- Last week, the Future Ventures initial public offering turned out to be a damp squib.

It's not clear, now, whether the nearly two dozen companies looking to raise funds still will take the public route. Public equity funds say they are talking to many of these companies, and see investment opportunities with exit windows shorter than two years.

The Indian government, however, seems unfazed and plans to conduct a follow-on public offer of Power Finance Corp., the fund-raising arm of state-owned power companies. The issue is expected to launch Tuesday.

Also on Tuesday, India Securities, an arm of the Essar group, will hold its board meeting to consider the merger of Essar Telecommunications Holdings, which was approved by the Madras High Court last month.

Later in the week, Tata Private Equity Group is expected to make an announcement. A briefing from last week was moved to this week. No indications yet on what it is, but stay tuned. 

Some pending issues that could be acted on this week include the meeting of a group of India's cabinet ministers to decide on Vedanta Resources' purchase of a majority stake in Cairn India. The panel is expected to make a final recommendation.

The Competition Commission of India is expected to release the final norms that govern acquisitions, especially by foreign investors, some time soon. The commission is incorporating changes recommended by industry groups and is taking its time to weigh all implications before issuing the final policy.
