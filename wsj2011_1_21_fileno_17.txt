 PLC said Friday the Australian Treasurer approved its takeover bid for  Riversdale Mining Ltd., leaving the company with the task of wooing Riversdale's board to close the deal. 

The Australian approval was the main regulatory hurdle the miner needed to clear its A$3.9 billion ($3.95 billion) offer for Riversdale made toward the end of last year. The miner needs to get approval from at least 50% of Riversdale's board to finalize the deal.

 said the Riversdale board of directors recommended accepting the proposal by Rio Tinto to acquire the company for A$16 a share.

Tata Steel owns a 24% stake in Riversdale and said at the end of December that it's not opposed to Rio Tinto's offer. 

The offer is scheduled to close Feb. 18, but could be extended, Rio Tinto said.
