On any given day, you can find 3M's inventors working on such products as ultra-skinny panels for solar cells or anti-microbial touch screens that let your fingers dodge co-workers' germs. Yet 3M's stock (MMM) lagged the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index last year as investors shunned mega-capitalization stocks.

"It's one of the most innovative industrials around," Mr. Geller says. "Its margins and ROA [return on assets] are second to nobody's."

One caveat: Mr. Buckley, at 64 years old, is nearing 3M's mandatory retirement age. But the company has a deep bench and doesn't look like it will run out of ideas any time soon.
