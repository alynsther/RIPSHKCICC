Coinciding with the International Contemporary Furniture Fair, this weekend's big design mecca, Moleskine, the line of luxe notebooks, calendars and journals, is hosting a "hacking event" at the Eyebeam Art & Technology Center on Sunday.

The company is promoting its new e-commerce venture that lets individuals customize—or "hack," as they call it, notebooks—and sell them to other Moleskine aficionados. Instructors will teach workshop participants how to install electroluminescent material directly onto the covers of their notebooks. 

"The idea is for the creative community in New York to engage with the analog and the digital continuum," said Moleskine CEO  Arrigo Berni, who will be flying in from Milan. "We are a part of the analog equation, but our users are very, very into the digital world."

Mr. Berni said he'd "like to say that twisting and changing our notebooks was our idea, but it really started from our users." 

While in town, he will also open the company's first shop-in-shop at Bloomingdale's. "These are all little experiments," he said. "It would be arrogant to say I have a precise endgame in mind, but in today's world, it's much more prudent to engage on many different levels and go from there."
