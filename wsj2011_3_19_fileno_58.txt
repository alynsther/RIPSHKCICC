U.S. lawmakers, their staffers and executive-branch employees would be banned from making investment decisions with nonpublic information under a bill proposed this week by two House Democrats.

The Stock Act, which was first introduced by Rep. Louise Slaughter (D., N.Y.) in 2006, would create insider-trading rules for government workers who often have privileged access to information. Rep. Tim Walz (D., Minn.) is also behind the latest effort.

Under the proposed bill, lawmakers and staffers would have to disclose any stock, bond or commodity-futures transactions in excess of $1,000 within 90 days. The bill would also require firms that specialize in helping investors get access to information on Capitol Hill to register with the House and Senate, much like lobbyists. 

The Justice Department is currently investigating an insider-trading case focused largely on these companies, known as expert-network firms. There's no evidence that their work in Washington is part of that broader investigation.

Currently, insider-trader rules that govern Wall Street do not apply to members of Congress.

"This is a matter of equality under the law," Mr. Walz said in a written statement. "The same standards we have established for Wall Street should apply to Congress. The potential for abuse is obvious."

Previous efforts to pass such a measure have failed and there's no indication that this effort will fare any better. 

The Wall Street Journal published a series of articles last year detailing ways in which lawmakers and their staffers are frequent stock traders using approaches permitted under current congressional rules.
