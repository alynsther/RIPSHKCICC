With an iron man's physique and a determination verging on mania,  Jack LaLanne became America's leading workout and natural nutrition guru in an era when such concerns were hardly mainstream.

Mr. LaLanne, who died Sunday at age 96 at his home in Morro Bay, Calif., opened a string of gyms in the 1930s and went on to host "The Jack LaLanne Show," syndicated nationwide.

Cheerful and distinctively dressed in a jumpsuit and ballet slippers, Mr. LaLanne was fond of slogans like, "First we inspire them, then we perspire them." But behind the glib exterior was a philosophy of exercise and whole foods that was decades ahead of its time.

To generate publicity, Mr. LaLanne liked to celebrate his birthday with stunts like swimming from Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco to Alcatraz Island—a distance of a mile and a half—with his feet chained together and towing a rowboat carrying a half-ton of sand. Other stunts included doing a thousand push-ups in 23 minutes, and towing 13 boats carrying 76 people through Long Beach Harbor, to celebrate the U.S. Bicentennial.

He said that his ideas about physical fitness were inspired by an encounter in 1929 with  Paul Bragg, a nutritionist who led tent-revival-style crusades for physical fitness. A sickly child, Mr. LaLanne credited Mr. Bragg's message for restoring him to health. 

In 1936, decades before clubs dotted cities and suburban strip malls, he opened his first gym, Jack LaLanne Physical Culture Studio. He built it into more than 200 clubs. They were eventually acquired by Bally Corp., which renamed them Bally Total Fitness.

Mr. LaLanne published several books on exercise and nutrition, and endorsed juicers and vitamin supplements. He continued to exercise up until the end of his life, according to his agent,  Rick Hersh, who announced Mr. LaLanne's death.

"I hate exercise," he told New York Newsday in 1988. "But I like the results."
