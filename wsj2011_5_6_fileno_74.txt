  Harry Macklowe, the developer who was forced to give up much of his real-estate empire amid the economic downturn, has reached a deal to buy an Upper East Side rental building for about $250 million, according to people familiar with the matter.

The planned acquisition of the 19-story property at 737 Park Ave. is the latest chapter in the attempted rebound by Mr. Macklowe, who is buying the building with a financial partner. The partner's identity couldn't be determined. Other financing also will be needed to close the deal.

In the past year, Mr. Macklowe has reached a deal to buy a nearby rental building on Lexington Avenue and 72nd Street, and he purchased an in-default mortgage on a development site on First Avenue and 52nd Street with the intent of seizing the property through foreclosure, people familiar with the matter said. 

He is also managing the development of a hotel and condo tower planned for the site of the former Drake Hotel on Park Avenue and 56th Street.

Mr. Macklowe put down a deposit to buy the 70-year-old building at 737 Park Avenue from descendants of New York developer Louis Katz, the people familiar with the matter said. The intent is to convert the building, which sits on the corner of 71st Street and Park Avenue, into condominiums.

The family retained Jones Lang LaSalle to sell the building and began marketing it in late winter. Mr. Macklowe was advised by  Howard Michaels of the Carlton Group.
