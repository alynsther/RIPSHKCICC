KOLKATA -- Hindusthan National Glass and Industries, India's largest glass-container manufacturer, has bought Germany's Agenda Glas AG for 50 million euros ($71 million).

The amount is to be paid over a year, the company said in a release. The firm is to be acquired by a wholly owned subsidiary HNG Global GmbH. 

This is the first overseas acquisition for Hindusthan National, which has a 55% share of the Indian glass-container market and aims to become one of the top 15 companies in the business in the world. 

The announcement pushed up the stock of Hindusthan National by 2.11% to 215.40 rupees on the Bombay Stock Exchange, while the benchmark Sensex dropped 1.34% to 18,335.79 points.

Hindusthan National bought Agenda Glas through an auction after the German company, which began commercial operations in February last year, went bankrupt. 

The firm currently has a production capacity of 320 tons per day against Hindusthan National's capacity of 2,825 tons spread across six factories. Agenda Glas' key customers are alcoholic beverage makers. 

Hindusthan National will enter the international market with this acquisition, said Mukul Somany, vice chairman and managing director of the company. The glass-container maker is pursuing growth opportunities abroad over the next three years, aggressively, he added. 

The company already has committed an investment of around 25 billion rupees over the next few years to ramp up production capacity in India. In fiscal 2012, its manufacturing capacity is expected to increase to 1.2 million tons from 785,000 tons.
