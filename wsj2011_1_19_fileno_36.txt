 to be further delayed because of a recent change in the U.S. company's global delivery schedule, a senior executive said Wednesday. 

"We now expect to get the Dreamliner only in the October-December period, instead of by July, as was earlier expected" the executive, who didn't want to be named, told Dow Jones Newswires. He said Boeing hasn't formally informed the airline of a delay yet. 

A Boeing spokeswoman in India separately said a revised delivery schedule for the Dreamliners will be released on Jan. 26, during a Boeing earnings call. She declined to elaborate. 

Boeing said Tuesday it now plans to deliver its first Dreamliner sometime in the third quarter this year. The Dreamliner program is already three years behind schedule, after being pushed back several times due to various technical issues. 

The latest setback--the seventh official delay--for the program comes more than two months after Boeing halted flight testing across its fleet of six test planes following an in-flight electrical fire and subsequent emergency landing. The first Dreamliner delivery had been expected to be made to Japan's  All Nippon Airways Co.

 in February. 

Air India bought 27 Dreamliners as part of an $15 billion 111 aircraft order to Boeing and its rival Airbus in 2005. According to the initial delivery schedule, Air India should have received 20 Dreamliners by now and is estimated to have lost 60 billion rupees ($1.32 billion) in revenue due to the delays, a company executive said recently.
