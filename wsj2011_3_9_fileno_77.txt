The Atlantic Theater Company—the off-Broadway outfit that birthed, among other hits, "Spring Awakening"—held its annual gala Monday night at the Lighthouse at Chelsea Piers with something of a recession-era theme, headlining it "Can You Spare A Dime?" after the popular Depression anthem of 1932.

In truth, there was nothing depressing—or recessionary—about the evening, which included cocktails, a live auction and a three-course dinner, followed by several performances of 1930s Broadway showtunes. A number of major stars of stage and screen turned out to celebrate, including Adrian Grenier from "Entourage" and John Slattery from "Mad Men," who introduced the auctioneer as guests overlooked a glittering Hudson river from the Lighthouse. Other stars came to perform, including musician and actor Brian D'Arcy James (who has performed for President Barack Obama and the First Lady) and Mary Beth Peil, the opera-singer-turned-actress who recently starred in "Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown." Both performed classic tunes from the pre-World War II era, as did singer-songwriter Joan Osborne. 

The Atlantic Theater Company, which was co-founded in 1985 by Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright David Mamet and actor William H. Macy, has produced about 130 plays. Its next production—the last of its 2010-11 season—will be the American premiere of Ingmar Bergman's "Through a Glass Darkly." It stars Carey Mulligan, who has drawn attention in Hollywood for recent performances in "Never Let Me Go" and "An Education." Here Ms. Mulligan will play Karin, a mentally unstable woman vacationing on an island with her husband, father and brother. The actress was last seen on the New York stage in the 2008 revival of "The Seagull."
