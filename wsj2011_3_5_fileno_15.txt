Derek Stepan had a goal and an assist, Mats Zuccarello and Artem Anisimov scored 12 seconds apart in the second period and the New York Rangers ended a three-game losing streak with a victory over the Senators Friday night in Ottawa. Vinny Prospal also scored to help New York move into seventh place in the Eastern Conference. The Rangers had entered the game on a 4-10-1 skid. Henrik Lundqvist made 28 saves in his 11th consecutive start, but he missed a chance to add to his NHL-leading eight shutouts.
