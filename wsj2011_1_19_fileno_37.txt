NEW DELHI -- India is expected to award an order for 126 fighter jets for its air force by the end of December, Junior Defense Minister M.M.  Pallam Raju said Wednesday.

"I am hopeful of awarding it by the end of this year," Mr. Raju said on the sidelines of a defense conference.

India plans to buy the 126 fighter jets estimated at more than $10 billion. Six companies-- Lockheed Martin Corp.,  Boeing Co., Eurofighter Typhoon, Russian Aircraft Corp., Sweden's  Saab AB and Dassault Aviation SA--are competing for the contract.

Mr. Raju said field trials by the six fighter jet makers have been completed.

"We have to do the comparative analysis in terms of how the different companies meet their offset obligations before we open the financial bids," the minister said.

Under current rules, foreign companies that receive import orders in excess of 3 billion rupees must draw at least 30% of that order from domestic suppliers or make a similar sized investment within India, in what is known as an offset.

The government has set the offset obligation for the 126-fighter jet contract at 50% of the value of the deal.
