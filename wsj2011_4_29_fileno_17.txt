MUMBAI -- Future Ventures India Ltd.'s initial share sale of up to 7.5 billion rupees ($169 million) was fully subscribed, just hours ahead of closing, according to stock exchange data. 

Future Ventures had received bids for 1.12 times the shares on offer as of 0730 GMT, data on the National Stock Exchange showed. 

The financial services firm, a part of the Future Group, had set an indicative price band of 10 rupees to 11 rupees per share for the issue, which opened Monday. 

The response to the initial public offering was tepid, and may blunt hopes of a revival in equity capital markets, analysts and investment bankers said. Last week, Muthoot Finance Ltd. sold 9.1 billion rupees ($205 million) in its share sale and was oversubscribed more than 24 times. 

The Future Ventures deal is the second-largest IPO to be launched in India this year, after the Muthoot share sale, and is being closely watched for indications of whether primary market activity in India may revive after a relatively weak patch so far this year. 

Enam Securities Pvt. Ltd., JM Financial Consultants Pvt. Ltd. and Kotak Mahindra Capital Co. Ltd. are managing the deal.
