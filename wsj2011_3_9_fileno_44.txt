A 31% spike in murders of African-Americans in 2010 accounted for all of last year's nearly 14% citywide increase in homicides, according to an analysis by the New York Police Department.

Black people, who comprise 25% of the city's population, accounted for 67% of the 536 murders in 2010, according to the report released Tuesday. Black men 15 to 29 years old were most likely to be killed. They make up less than 3% of the city's population but last year represented 33% of all homicide victims, according to the report. 

The number of Hispanic and Asian murder victims remained "nearly constant," the report states, while the number of murdered whites decreased by 27% from 2009 to 2010.

 Ric Curtis, an anthropology professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said he and his colleagues were asked by the Brooklyn District Attorney's Office last year to explore whether gangs are behind the spike; some 11% of all murder victims were gang members. But Mr. Curtis said he doesn't necessarily think gangs are to blame. "Whatever it is, it's complex because it's not readily apparent what is causing it," Mr. Curtis said.
