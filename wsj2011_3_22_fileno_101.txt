CARACASâ€”Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, who routinely blames capitalism for many of this world's troubles, pointed elsewhere in the galaxy for his latest critique, saying Tuesday that the economic system may have destroyed life on Mars.

"I have always said, have heard, that it would not be strange that there had been civilization on Mars," the firebrand socialist said on Venezuela's state television. After pausing a moment, he added, "But perhaps capitalism arrived there, imperialism arrived, and finished that planet."

Chavez had been discussing water conservation and had meandered onto the subject of Mars after remarking that he believed that some traces of water had been discovered on the Red Planet. 

Following his speculation that capitalism may have destroyed a previous Martian civilization, he warned that water supplies on this planet are dwindling.

On Earth, "where there were great forests hundreds of years ago or less, there are now deserts, where there were once rivers, now are deserts," he said.

Guy Webster, a spokesman with the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said "water has been discovered on Mars." Mr. Webster wouldn't comment on Mr. Chavez's statement. 

Mr. Webster said scientists had observed possible evidence of water on the Red Planet as early as the 1970s, but it was only in 2008 with NASA's Phoenix Mars Lander was direct chemical analysis performed and the discovery confirmed.
