  Joshua Komisarjevksy, one of two defendants in a triple murder trial in Cheshire, Conn., filed a court motion Friday to enter into a conditional guilty plea in exchange for life imprisonment. 

Authorities have accused Mr. Komisarjevksy, 30 years old, and  Steven Hayes, 47, of a July 2007 home invasion in which  Jennifer Hawke-Petit was raped and strangled to death. Her two daughters were bound to their beds, where they died of smoke inhalation. Her husband,  Dr. William Petit, was beaten with a baseball bat but survived.

Mr. Hayes was convicted on all charges but an arson charge and sentenced to death in December. 

In court, Mr. Hayes had also made a request in court to change his plea to guilty, but later rescinded when defense attorneys threatened to withdraw from the case if he were allowed to change his plea. Defense attorney  Thomas Ulmann said at the time, "We are not here to assist Mr. Hayes in committing suicide, either by his own hands or by the state of Connecticut." 

Attorneys for Mr. Komisarjevksy said in the motion that their client's participation in the crimes is "appreciably different than Hayes'."

"Irrespective of how the Court rules on this motion, [he] will die in prison. The only issue is whether [he] will die in the hands of the state or at the ordinary expiration of his natural life," attorneys for Mr. Komisarjevksy's wrote in the motion. 

Prosecutors couldn't be reached for comment. 

If the court accepts Mr. Komisarjevksy's guilty plea, it will impose a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole or release for any reason. If the court rejects his plea, he will face the possibility of a death sentence.
