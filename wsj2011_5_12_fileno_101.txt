It was a moment that overshadowed the Yankees' 4-3 extra-inning loss to Kansas City.

In the fifth inning, Robinson Cano was hit by a 93 mph Nathan Adcock fastball to the head, square on the interlocking NY on his batting helmet.

Cano sat dazed, then got up and walked to first. Soon, he was calling for trainers, and heading back to the dugout to end his night. His condition is unclear.

The next inning, A.J. Burnett—pitching a one hitter—walked a man and then hit Kansas City's Jeff Francoeur with a 1-1 cutter, putting the go-ahead run on base to threaten a 2-1 Yankee lead. It's unclear if it was retaliation, given the tight situation and Burnett's history of wildness.

Regardless, the Yankees and Royals traded leads until the 11th, when the Royals won it on an Eric Hosmer sacrifice fly.

DENVER—With rain in the forecast and temperatures in the 40s, the Mets' game against the Colorado Rockies Wednesday was postponed until 3:10 p.m. Thursday. The pitching matchup will remain the same, with Jon Niese starting for the Mets against Rockies right-hander Ubaldo Jimenez.

Wednesday's game was called before players even arrived at Coors Field. Both teams had a scheduled off day Thursday. The Mets had planned to fly to Houston after Wednesday's game but will instead depart Thursday evening.

Because their hotel was booked for Wednesday night, the team had to move to a different hotel Wednesday afternoon.

Otherwise, the day off allowed Manager Terry Collins to give third baseman David Wright the day off to rest his ailing back. It's possible he could play Thursday.
