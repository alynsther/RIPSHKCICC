Salang Pass has become a big draw for local workers in Fremont, home to one of the largest Afghan communities in the U.S.

A top seller on the lamb-heavy menu is kabli palow, an $11 baked dish of rice sprinkled with almonds and topped with a lamb shank. There are also plenty of vegetarian dishes, including bolani, a calzone-like appetizer filled with potato and served with yogurt sauce, for $7.50.

Co-owner,  Zarmina Wahid opened Salang Pass in 1997 after moving to Fremont from Denver. She says her clientele has gradually grown as local people have come to "understand the food." She says the restaurant draws a lunchtime crowd of workers from nearby Kaiser Permanente and Washington Hospital.

It also recently attracted Christa Yam, 30 years old, a school psychologist who met for lunch at Salang Pass with her counterparts at other schools after another restaurant they tried to visit was closed. "We ended up having a really good time," says Ms. Yam, who ordered a plate of aushak, a scallion-and-cilantro dumpling, for $11.50. 

Located at 37462 Fremont Blvd. in Fremont, Salang Pass is closed for lunch on Mondays and open Tuesday through Thursday from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. and Friday through Sunday from 11 a.m. to 10:30 p.m.
