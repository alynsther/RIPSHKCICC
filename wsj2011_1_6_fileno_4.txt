BERLIN—Last season, the Berlin Staatsoper moved west after its 18th-century opera house on East Berlin's Unter den Linden closed for a four-year renovation. Until October 2014, operas are being staged at the Schiller Theater, once one of Europe's most prestigious dramatic houses, which went dark in the early 1990s. 

The Schiller Theater, built in the early 20th century, is a fine space but hardly anybody's idea of an ideal opera venue. However, with its radical reinterpretation of Jacques Offenbach's "Orpheus in the Underworld," the Staatsoper has killed two birds with one production. By emphasizing theatricality rather than musicality, the production restores the piece to its popular origins, while maximizing the possibilities of the company's temporary home. 

"Orpheus," which premiered in 1858, was Europe's first full-length operetta. Director Philipp Stölzl, who also helped design the playful collapsible sets, has turned the risqué French original, which has settled uncomfortably into the stuffy realms of the high operatic repertoire, into a German-language revue. The leads are carried, if not exactly sung, by well-known actors, with new text by German cabaret star Thomas Pigor. 

Musical moments are left to Eurydice, sung with gusto by young Evelin Novak, and to the outstanding chorus. Indeed, this may be the first production of "Orpheus" in which the chorus, refashioned as a chorus line, manages to steal the show.
