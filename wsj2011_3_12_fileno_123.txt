Party like it's 1977 with this new crop of multifunctional fondue sets. We put a dozen to the test -- with cheese, chocolate and sirloin -- and picked our five favorites based on sturdiness, versatility and style. 

 Trudeau Century 3-in-1 Fondue Set | trudeaucorp.com // $50 

 Plus: This small and versatile stainless-steel set has a ceramic divider insert for heating cheese and chocolate simultaneouslyâ€” perfect for date night at home. It also includes four ramekins for dipping sauces.

 Minus: Not big enough to accommodate the hungry masses, and the swirly wire stand has a slightly cheapo look about it. 



 Bodum Stainless Steel Fondue Set | bodumusa.com // $170  

 Plus: The sleek fluted-glass design is more boutique hotel than Swiss chalet, and this meat-, cheese- and chocolate-accommodating set is a great size for large groups. 

 Minus: We had to prepare the fondue in a different saucepan and then transfer to the set, which was a bit of a dishwashing burden. And because the pot is so tall and deep, we needed a lot of Sterno to get the party started. 

 Swissmar Lugano Cheese Fondue Set | swissmar.com/usa // $85 

 Plus: We loved the traditional-looking pan, which transferred smoothly from stovetop to rechaud. 

 Minus: While this was far and away our favorite cheese-only, it is cheese-only, so meat-lovers take heed. 

 Le Creuset Traditional Fondue Set | lecreuset.com // $160 

 Plus: This super-simple cast-iron fondue set kept the oil sizzling the longest, making it our favorite set for grilling meat. 

 Minus: The wide-mouth top occasionally seemed in danger of tipping. 



 Emile Henry Flame Top Fondue Set | emilehenryusa.com // $120 

 Plus: It's lightweight and cooked cheeses and meats evenly on the stovetop and fondue rechaud.

 Minus: Be prepared to pour lots of oil into this wide-diameter pot if you plan to cook meat.
