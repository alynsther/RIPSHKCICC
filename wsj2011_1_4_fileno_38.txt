 began jockeying for a piece of the deal struck by the securities firm to invest in social-networking company Facebook Inc., according to people familiar with the situation.

The agreement by Goldman to invest $500 million in Facebook along with Digital Sky Technologies of Russia ignited a frenzy of phone calls and email by clients in the private wealth-management division at Goldman.

Those clients got a memo from Goldman offering them the opportunity to buy equity in Facebook, with a minimum investment of $2 million, these people said. On Monday, it appeared unlikely that anyone would get that much because the deal is expected to be oversubscribed by as much as three or four times.

Goldman typically requires clients of its private wealth-management unit to have a net worth of at least $10 million. To get Facebook shares, clients must agree not to sell them until 2013. The sale ban includes secondary markets that allow investors to buy or sell private-equity ownership stakes.

According to a memo from Goldman, clients also would have to acknowledge that they are receiving material non-public information about Facebook's financial condition. "This information is not to be used other than in connection with your investment," Goldman said.

Goldman declined to comment.
