WASHINGTON—The Obama administration launched a monthlong process Friday to determine which states will receive $2.4 billion to upgrade and construct passenger-rail lines, after Florida rejected the funds last month. 

Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said he would redistribute the money through a competitive process, with an April 4 deadline for states to apply. The move kicks off what is sure to be an intense lobbying campaign among states vying for the money, including California and New York, which have already written to the transportation secretary. 

Florida Gov. Rick Scott's rejection of the money—following the footsteps of fellow Republican governors in Ohio and Wisconsin—has raised questions about the Obama administration's vision for a nationwide high-speed rail network. Mr. LaHood has defended the program against Republican claims of government waste, contending that the rail funds will create jobs and spur economic development. 

Friday, Mr. LaHood said states have been "banging down our door" for the Florida money. 

The administration must now decide whether to award the money to construction of new, high-profile lines, such as a proposed bullet train between Los Angeles and San Francisco, or to smaller projects such as upgrades to Amtrak lines in the Northeastern states. 

The Transportation Department said awards would be "merit-driven," going to projects that promise "public and economic benefits quickly." 

"A project's ability to reduce energy consumption, improve the efficiency of a region's overall transportation network, and generate sustained economic activity along the corridor are among the selection criteria," the agency said.
