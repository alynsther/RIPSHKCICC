TAMPAâ€”The notion that the Yankees wouldn't or couldn't move Derek Jeter out of the leadoff spot in their 2011 batting order was always dubious. (Moving him from shortstop, of course, is another matter entirely.)

During his 16-year career with the team, Jeter has batted second more often than he has any other lineup position, and it's not close. Of his 2,295 games as a Yankee, he's been the team's No. 2 hitter 1,270 times. So his return there for the team's spring-training game Thursday night against the Tampa Bay Rays and the ascension of leftfielder Brett Gardner as the Yankees' leadoff hitter shouldn't have been all that surprising.

If the primary functions of a leadoff hitter are to get on base frequently, provide some speed on the base paths and give his teammates a good, long look at an opposing pitcher's repertoire, Gardner would seem the ideal choice. He had a higher on-base percentage (.383 vs. .340) and stole two-and-a-half times more bases (47 to 18) than Jeter last year, and Gardner saw 4.61 pitches in an average plate appearance. No hitter in the American League saw more.

"It's why we're trying it, because of what he did last year," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said.

Gardner customarily batted eighth or ninth for the Yankees last season and hit .277 with 97 runs scored. But over the 25 games that the Yankees used him as their leadoff hitter, he could hardly have performed better in the role. His on-base percentage was .600; his batting average, .500.

Though he himself noted that such a sample size wasn't all that large, leading off isn't unfamiliar to him. He did it for most of his career at the College of Charleston, where he remains the program's all-time leader in runs scored, singles and stolen bases.

"My approach doesn't change when I'm hitting there," Gardner said. "It's not something I'm scared of or don't want to do."
