European markets rallied Thursday, breaking a six-session losing streak, as investors snapped up insurers and industrial firms on speculation that many stocks have been oversold in the wake of Japan's earthquake last week. 

The mood was lifted following reports of progress in containing Japan's nuclear power crisis. Tokyo Electric Power said it had connected a power cable to the Fukushima plant and water shots were effective in cooling a fuel pool, according to Japanese media reports. 

Hopes that the authorities would be successful in helping to bring the radiation-leaking nuclear facility under control helped trim stocks' losses in Asia. Japan's Nikkei Stock Average, down as much as 5% at one point, ended 1.4% lower. 

In Europe, the Stoxx Europe 600 index rose 1.9% to 267.08. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 index gained 1.8% to 5969.11, France's CAC-40 index added 2.4% to 3786.21 and Germany's DAX jumped 2.2% to 6656.88.

Basic resources and insurance stocks provided the biggest support, with the Stoxx Europe 600 index for the sector up 2.7%, as base-metal prices advanced. The Stoxx Europe 600 insurance index gained 2.9%. 

Late in European trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 142 points, or 1.2%, at 11755,after falling 3.6% since Friday. In U.S. data, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's manufacturing survey for March showed its best reading since January 1984, well outstripping expectations. 

Other U.S. economic reports were mixed. The weekly report on the number of U.S. workers filing new claims for unemployment showed a bigger-than-expected drop last week, while consumer prices rose in February at their fastest pace since mid-2009, as energy and food prices continued to move higher.

In the currency markets, the Japanese the yen came off the record highs against the dollar as market participants prepared for potential intervention by the Japanese to force the yen lower. Japanese officials claimed the spike in the yen was driven by speculators, not by repatriation flows in the wake of last Friday's earthquake. 

By late European trade, the dollar was trading at 78.87 yen, after hitting a record low of 76.25 yen. Meanwhile, the euro hit its highest against the dollar since Nov. 8. The common currency breached $1.40 and climbed as high as $1.4053 before retreating to trade at $1.4014, up from $1.3890 late Wednesday in New York. This followed a smooth Spanish debt auction, with €4.13 billion ($5.74 billion) of 10-year and 30-year bonds sold. 

Also bond spreads were calmer Thursday, having shown some volatility earlier in the week following Portugal's sovereign-debt downgrade. 

In commodity markets, light, sweet crude for April delivery was up $2.80 at $100.79 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Gold for April delivery was up 0.5% at $1403.50 per troy ounce on the Comex division of Nymex.
