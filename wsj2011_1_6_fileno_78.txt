TOKYO—Japan's auto makers had a year of mixed fortunes in 2010, industry sales data showed Wednesday. 

Bolstered by government incentives for purchases of fuel-efficient vehicles in the first eight months, domestic sales rebounded from 2009 lows stretching back at least 30 years, only to slide again after the subsidies expired in September. 

The Japan Automobile Dealers Association said sales of new cars, trucks and buses rose 10.6% to 3.23 million vehicles in 2010—the first increase since 2003, when sales rose 1.5% to 4.03 million vehicles. 

A spokesman for the auto-dealers association said last year's growth was the biggest percentage increase since 1989, when sales soared 11.9% to 5.56 million vehicles. 

The figures don't include sales of mini cars and trucks with engine capacities of 660 cubic centimeters or less. 

Vehicle sales rose for 13 straight months until August, as government subsidies for consumer purchases of new fuel-efficient vehicles since April 2009 propped up demand for compact and hybrid vehicles. 

  Toyota Motor Corp.'s Prius, for example, held the No. 1 spot in monthly sales by model for more than a year thanks to the subsidies. The Prius is likely to come in as the best-selling model of 2010 when further data are released next week. 

But the government program ended in September, sharply denting appetite for new vehicles. The domestic sales tumble came as a strong yen cut into overseas profits and made vehicles built in Japan less competitive abroad. 

The auto-dealers association also said Wednesday that December sales declined 28.3% from a year earlier to 179,666 vehicles, the fourth consecutive monthly drop. 

Such tepid demand will likely eat into Japan's overall auto sales in 2011. 

"Without some kind of [government] incentives, this year could be even worse" for domestic auto sales, with potential demand already depressed by the weak economy,  Katsuaki Watanabe, vice chairman of Toyota, said Wednesday at a New Year's reception held by Japan's auto-industry groups. 

The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, another industry group, said last month it projects sales of vehicles excluding mini models to fall 13% to 2.81 million in 2011 from 3.23 million in 2010. The auto-dealers association doesn't have its own forecast for 2011, the spokesman said. 

Reflecting such dour prospects, Toyota said in December it expects a 12% fall in its domestic sales to 1.93 million vehicles this year. 

But some bright spots will likely emerge for the industry toward the end of this year, the head of the auto-manufacturers association said last month. Monthly auto sales are likely to begin to recover from the year-earlier period around September, said the group's chairman,  Toshiyuki Shiga. 

The effects of the sudden drop in demand after the end of government aid will start to have less of a distorting effect on year-to-year comparison figures, said Mr. Shiga, also  Nissan Motor Co.'s chief operating officer. 

In 2010, Toyota's domestic sales rose 13.8% to 1.53 million vehicles with those of the Lexus line up 18.5% to 33,365. Nissan posted a 7.4% increase to 499,252 vehicles in Japan last year, according to the auto-dealers association.
