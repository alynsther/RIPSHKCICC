A 26-year-old Manhattan man, who was apparently suicidal, survived a nine-story plunge from his apartment Sunday when he landed on a large pile of full trash bags left uncollected because of the massive snowstorm last week, authorities said.

"It looks like the huge pile of trash saved him," said a law-enforcement official with knowledge of the case. The man, who was identified as Vangelis Kapatos, landed on his back and was found semiconscious by officers responding to a 911 call from a parking-garage attendant who witnessed the fall in front of a building on West 45th Street in Hell's Kitchen.

The official said Mr. Kapatos had apparently tried to kill himself before jumping at about midnight by slashing his throat, but the wound was superficial.

He was taken to Bellevue Hospital by ambulance and was listed in critical but stable condition, police said. His injuries weren't considered life-threatening, the official said.

The city Department of Sanitation stopped garbage collection early last week as a powerful blizzard dumped nearly 20 inches of snow on the city. Officials said garbage collection will resume Monday.

Mr. Kapatos has a history of psychiatric problems and was discharged Friday from Bellevue after being treated for an undisclosed mental-health issue, the official said.

The ceilings and walls in his ninth-floor apartment were painted black and black curtains hung from his windows, the official said.
