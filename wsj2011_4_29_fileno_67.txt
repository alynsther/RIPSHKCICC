The last in a series of excerpts from Rex Ryan's new book: "Play Like You Mean It: Passion, Laughs, and Leadership in the World's Most Beautiful Game." Here, he discusses the impact former Baltimore Raven Bart Scott had on rookie quarterback Mark Sanchez.



During the entire off-season and into training camp in 2009, Bart Scott was on Mark Sanchez's case, our rookie quarterback, every day—just pushing the kid's buttons to see how competitive Sanchez would be. Again, it wasn't ever personal or mean. He would just say stuff to challenge Sanchez like: "Rookie, what you got? You gonna make a play or you gonna fold?' And what happened? One day in practice, Sanchez looked across the line, told Scott to shut the hell up, and hit a big pass in a situational drill. Everybody was laughing; it was great. That was when we all knew that Sanchez wasn't going to get scared. He might struggle a bit as learned the ropes, but he wasn't going to fold just because some veteran was talking trash to him. I talked to Scott about that one after the practice and he was grinning as he told me how much he loved it. That's what he was trying to get out of Sanchez, and it worked. Nobody will fight for a teammate more than Bart Scott. That's why I wanted him so badly. Our team needed that more than they needed Ray Lewis's intensity. Trust me, Ray Lewis is great, but like I said, he represents the Ravens. He doesn't represent the Jets. We needed guys who would represent us—who would bring out the best not just in themselves but in the other guys in the locker room.
