Moody's Investors Service issued a two-notch downgrade on Portugal's long-term government bond ratings, citing subdued growth prospects and productivity gains over the near term until structural reforms are enacted. 

The ratings agency said the action was also driven by implementation risks for the government's austerity plan, which has faced opposition from the center-right Social Democrats. Challenging market conditions, which have led to higher government financing costs, and a fear the government's balance sheet may need to expand further to provide support to the banking sector, were additional factors prompting the downgrade. 

Portugal's government is facing political turmoil that threatens to derail its ambition to solve the crisis alone. The nation's Social Democrats are opposed to the minority government's new austerity measures announced Friday that called for further spending cuts and boosted state revenue by further tax increases. 

The nation is at the center of a storm that has already hit Greece and Ireland, as it is struggling with a high budget deficit that must be brought down to 4.6% of gross domestic product this year and 3% in 2012, from around 7% last year. 

Moody's said the new austerity measures "figured prominently in the rating conclusion." It expects that revenue increases, expenditure reductions, and structural reforms specified by the government would be achieved, and is "a critical consideration" supporting the new rating. 

Portugal's rating was lowered to A3, which is four levels into investment-grade territory. The rating outlook is negative, meaning future downgrades are possible. 

Earlier Tuesday, Portugal's Prime Minister Jose Socrates acknowledged if the new austerity plan was voted down in parliament, his government would likely face early elections. He also said a political crisis would inevitably cause the country to request external help.
