Blue-chip stocks finished virtually unchanged as investors dumped energy and materials stocks and headed for the safety of bonds and telecommunications companies.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 0.15 point higher, at 12807.51, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index shed 4.60 points, or 0.3%, to 1356.62. The Nasdaq Composite declined 22.46 points, or 0.8%, to 2841.62.

Pulling on the upside were telecommunications stocks, after  MetroPCS Communications' first-quarter earnings more than doubled, thanks to the best-ever quarter for customer additions at the prepaid wireless provider. MetroPCS surged 1.67, or 10%, to 18.15, while  AT&T

 gained 65 cents, or 2.1%, to 31.86.

Utilities stocks also were strong on a day that saw investors rotate into perceived safety shelters, including Treasury bonds.

"What's really interesting is we're seeing investors shift to more of a defensive stand, the 10-year bond yield is falling, and people are putting more into bonds and higher-yielding stocks like utilities and telecoms," said  Kate Warne, market strategist for brokerage firm Edward Jones in St. Louis. "We're seeing a bit of wait-and-see approach: Where can I get yield, where can I get less exposure from the metals and the things that have been doing well lately?"
