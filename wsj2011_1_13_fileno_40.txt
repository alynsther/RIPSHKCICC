Considering the unending series of rumors these days, it almost feels inevitable that Denver superstar Carmelo Anthony will eventually be traded to either the Knicks or the Nets.

Statistically speaking, neither team's fan base should get too excited.

Mr. Anthony is on pace to finish this season worth the equivalent of 6.8 wins, using the metric "Wins Produced" that predicts how statistics correlate to winning. Developed by Southern Utah University economics professor David Berri, Wins Produced devalues scoring totals in favor of other stats, particularly shooting efficiency.

Essentially, Mr. Anthony scores like an elite player, but he requires more shots to put up his numbers than a true superstar. This season, Mr. Anthony holds an effective field goal percentage—a weighted statistic that takes 3-pointers into account—of 45.1%. By comparison, LeBron James's effective field goal percentage is 52%. A franchise player, Mr. Berri says, will produce between 25-30 wins a season. Chris Paul is on pace to have 25.8 Wins Produced this season. Last year, Mr. James had 27.2, and Dwight Howard had 22.3.

Mr. Berri concluded that New Jersey would win about 30 games over a full season if the latest reported 13-player, three-team deal goes through, which involves sending Derrick Favors and Devin Harris to Denver. The Nets would also acquire Chauncey Billups and Richard Hamilton. 

Trading for Mr. Anthony could be even more devastating for the Knicks. Their proposed deal would force them to move two of their most productive players: Landry Fields (on pace for 17.6 Wins Produced) and Wilson Chandler (10.3). If the Knicks replaced Messrs. Fields and Chandler with Mr. Anthony, Mr. Berri predicts they would win roughly 29 games over a full year.
