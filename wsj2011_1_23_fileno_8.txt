LONDON—U.K. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said Sunday that there is a "strong case" to separate retail banking from high-risk investment banking in order to insulate the U.K. economy from the banks' liabilities. 

Mr. Clegg's comment come after  John Vickers, chairman of the Independent Commission on Banking, Saturday said U.K. banks combining retail and investment banking might need to be separated—one of the strongest indications yet that banks such as  Barclays

 PLC and  Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC could be forced to restructure. Speaking on the BBC's  Andrew Marr show, Mr. Clegg said he has "always been attracted" to the idea of separating the banks. 

"I think the banking system needs to be made safe," he said. "It can never again become such an oversized liability to the British economy, and that is why I think there is a strong case to look at the way you can hive off, or insulate, very high risk, over-leveraged banking activities from low risk, high-street retail banking." 

During a speech Saturday at the London Business School, Mr. Vickers said the commission is still studying the pros and cons of so-called universal banks, but he said their main argument that weakness in one division can be offset by strength in the other doesn't necessarily result in a safer financial system overall. 

Mr. Vickers said universal banks' investment banking arms effectively have a state guarantee against failure, while a stand-alone investment bank might not, potentially giving the universal bank incentives to take on more risk. The Independent Commission on Banking is due to make final reform recommendations to the government in September.
