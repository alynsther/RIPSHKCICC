Owner  Paul Krug's vision for Glaze, a new quick-service restaurant in Midtown East, is to take the typical Seattle-style teriyaki restaurant and "spruce it up" to focus on great ingredients, he says.

The menu is simple: a few starters including a cold soba noodle salad and miso soup, seven main-course options to be served teriyaki-style with rice and for dessert one offering: rice pudding. Lunch starts at about $10.

While it is unusual to think of a teriyaki preparation as wholesome—everything is slicked in a thick, sweet sauce—Glaze manages to keep things relatively light and fresh. Mr. Krug says that teriyaki salmon with brown rice is popular. 

A less virtuous option is the tasty pork loin or beef sirloin with the spicy teriyaki sauce. A must-order is the charred pork rib, a non-teriyaki, non-Seattle dish that Mr. Krug and chef  Dennis Lake developed just for pork-crazed New York diners.
