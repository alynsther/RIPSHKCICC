LONDON—U.K. industrial output is expected to pick up further in the three months from January, but price expectations are at their highest level for more than two years, a survey by the Confederation of British Industry showed Thursday. 

The survey is likely to add to concerns that the Bank of England may have to raise interest rates sooner than expected after the U.K.'s annual inflation rate jumped to 3.7% in December. 

The CBI's industrial output balance rose to 17 in January from 13 in December. The balance measures the percentage of firms that expect stronger output over the next three months minus the percentage that expect weaker output. 

The survey showed that firms expect prices increases to accelerate sharply over the next three months, with a balance of 31 expecting prices to rise—the highest level since August 2008, when it was also 31. 

"Manufacturers have come under intense pressure to pass on rising costs; they have increased prices markedly in this quarter and expect to raise them at an even faster over the next three months," said  Ian McCafferty, the CBI's chief economic adviser. "This will drive further inflationary pressure in the wider economy."
