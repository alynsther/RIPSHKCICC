Millions of dollars for veterans and their families are sitting unclaimed.

The money typically represents life-insurance policy payouts or dividend checks and premium refunds that were mailed to policyholders. If payments couldn't be delivered, the Department of Veterans Affairs holds the money indefinitely, says  Thomas Lastowka, the department's director for insurance.

To see if you or a family member has any unclaimed money, check on the Veterans Affairs website (https://insurance.va.gov/liability/ufsearch.htm). You'll need to plug in the veteran's full name, date of birth and date of death (if applicable).

Be careful when searching common names -- say,  John Smith. To verify an identity, you also may need the veteran's VA insurance file number or service number, which can be found on enlistment or discharge documents (many of which are on file at county courthouses).

You also can claim money by calling 1-800-669-8477 or writing to the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office and Insurance Center.

Between January 2007 and November 2010, $6.4 million have been claimed, Mr. Lastowka says. Life-insurance claims usually average about $4,500 while other checks range from $1 to $750.

When it comes to collecting money owed to a deceased veteran, generally the surviving spouse has access first, followed by children and parents.
