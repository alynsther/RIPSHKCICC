 Q: Regarding your article on creativity, can you suggest resources for parents to nurture their kids' creativity?  



A: Parents can start early by encouraging creative play. Give children simple items to play with, such as string, boxes or tape, so they will have to use imagination to make something of them. Improvisational role-playing, acting and games also help; for ideas, do an Internet search on "improv games." Encourage children to make up their own new lyrics to familiar children's songs, or develop new plots for favorite book or television characters. 

Among helpful books, "Scamper: Combined Edition," by  Bob Eberle, has games and activities for developing a child's imagination; "CPS for Kids," by Bob Eberle and  Bob Stanish, has resources for teaching children creative problem-solving methods; and "Light Up Your Child's Mind" by  Joseph Renzulli and others offers parent-directed exercises for sparking a child's curiosity and creative thinking. After your children enter school, watch for opportunities for them to participate in creative problem-solving programs. One example is Destination ImagiNation, Cherry Hill, N.J., an educational nonprofit that involves nearly 100,000 students in annual competitions; information can be found at idodi.org, and the organization also sells creativity games at shopdi.org. Information on another program, Odyssey of the Mind, Sewell, N.J., can be found at odysseyofthemind.com. A third program, Future Problem-Solving Program International, Melbourne, Fla., offers information at fpspi.org. Also, information on summer "invention camps" can be found at invent.org.
