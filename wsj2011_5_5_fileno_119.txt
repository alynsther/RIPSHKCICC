There's only one thing more brutal in boxing than having to fight either Manny Pacquiao or Floyd Mayweather Jr.: having to fight both of them.

Shane Mosley will attempt this exercise in masochism Saturday when he faces Pacquiao in Las Vegas—a little over a year after he lost to Mayweather in a decision. And if history is any indicator, Mosley will fare worse this time around. Three brave opponents have entered the ring against one of these destructive fighters and shortly later against the other, and all have done worse against whichever guy they got second. If this holds true, the forecast for Mosley against Pacquiao is something worse than a decision: losing by knockout or technical knockout.

Superstars like Pacquiao and Mayweather have a history of ruining challengers physically and psychologically, softening them up for future opponents. Oscar De La Hoya and Ricky Hatton each lost to Mayweather, then suffered a worse loss to Pacquiao less than 20 months later. Neither Hatton nor De La Hoya has fought since.

Pacquiao's trainer Freddie Roach recently said he'd like his fighter to beat Mosley more badly than Mayweather did, just to one-up him. So until the day when Pacquiao and Mayweather actually face each other, out-pummeling common opponents will have to suffice.
