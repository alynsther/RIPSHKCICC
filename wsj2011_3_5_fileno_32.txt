 PLC on Friday rejected OAO  Norilsk Nickel's sweetened offer to buy most of Rusal's 25% stake in the firm, the latest twist in the struggle for control of the world's largest nickel producer. 

Norilsk is at the center of a power struggle between Rusal Chief Executive  Oleg Deripaska, and  Vladimir Potanin, a billionaire with a stake of just under 30% in Norilsk. 

On Feb. 11, Norilsk sweetened its offer to buy a 20% stake in Norilsk held by the Hong Kong-listed Russian aluminium firm for $12.8 billion, which would leave Rusal with a 5% stake, in a bid to resolve the long-running battle for control. In December, Rusal had rejected the nickel miner's offer to buy Rusal's full 25% stake in the company for $14 billion. 

Mr. Deripaska has said he doesn't want to sell the stake, but several minority shareholders have publicly called on him to accept the latest offer, which they say is well above market prices. 

However, Rusal said in a statement Friday its board rejected Norilsk's offer, calling it not in the best interests of Rusal and its shareholders. It didn't elaborate. 

Norilsk President  Andrey Klishas said in a statement the company "doesn't plan to make new offers to Rusal." Norilsk shareholders are scheduled to meet March 11. 

Shares in Hong Kong-listed Rusal were up 3.6% at 12.76 Hong Kong dollars ($1.64) in Asia Friday, reversing a 5.1% fall Thursday.
