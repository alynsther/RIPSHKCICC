NEW DELHI â€“Bharti Airtel Ltd. said Thursday it expects third-generation services to help improve its average revenue per user--a key gauge of profitability for mobile phone operators. 

Bharti Airtel, India's largest mobile phone operator by users, currently offers 3G services in seven cities and plans to extend the service in all the 13 telecom areas where it has bandwidth by the end of this month. 

Third-generation services allow multimedia capabilities on mobile networks and are likely to improve the operating performance of telecom companies as they can charge higher tariffs in a market where intensifying competition has hit their revenue growth, margins, average revenue per user and profitability. 

For telecom operators such as Bharti, average revenue per user over the past couple of years has dropped also because they tapped lower-income rural customers. 

Bharti's average revenue per user from wireless operations in India fell to 198 rupees ($4.4) in the three months through December from 230 rupees in the same period a year earlier. 

  Atul Mohan Bindal, president of mobile services at Bharti, said the company is in talks with other 3G operators in India for roaming pacts so that it can offer 3G services beyond the 13 telecom circles. 

"Hopefully, [talks with other operators] will be concluded very soon," Mr. Bindal told a news conference held to announce the introduction of 3G services in the national capital. 

Bharti currently has 500,000 3G users. The company last year won bandwidth in a government auction to offer 3G services in 13 of 22 telecom service areas the country is divided into.
