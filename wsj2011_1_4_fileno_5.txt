Last month, Salman Taseer, the liberal-minded governor of the Pakistani province of Punjab, appealed to President Asif Ali Zardari to commute the death sentence of a Christian woman named Asia Bibi, a mother of five who had been convicted of blasphemy by a local court. On Tuesday, Taseer paid dearly for his decency when one of his bodyguards murdered him at close range.

Taseer's assassination has aggravated a brewing political crisis that may soon lead to the collapse of Mr. Zardari's government. That has potentially serious consequences for the U.S., which has benefited from the current government's acquiescence in drone strikes against Taliban and al Qaeda targets on Pakistan's side of the Afghan border.

But Pakistan's deepest crisis isn't political. It's moral. Ms. Bibi's only crime was to have been involved in a verbal altercation with fellow field hands after they had refused to take water drawn by her "unclean" Christian hands, an insult to which she allegedly replied in kind. That put her afoul of Pakistan's infamous blasphemy laws under which hundreds of Christians, Ahmadis and Hindus have been persecuted for decades. Taseer was among the most prominent politicians in Pakistan to call for those laws to be amended.

Pakistan's radical Islamist parties—which have never had much success at the polls but know how to dominate a street—are now treating Taseer's killer as a hero. As for the rest of Pakistan, this is the time to honor the fallen governor by demanding the government release Ms. Bibi, rescind the blasphemy laws, and stand up to the murderers among them.
