The head of New York City Ballet,  Peter Martins, was arrested on misdemeanor drunken-driving charges in the early hours of the New Year, Westchester County police confirmed Wednesday to The Wall Street Journal. 

Mr. Martins, 64 years old and the company's ballet master in chief, was arrested after being stopped at a DWI checkpoint in Yonkers on the Saw Mill River Parkway, less than one mile north of the Bronx, at 1:54 a.m. on Jan. 1, according to police spokesman Kieran O'Leary. Information concerning his blood-alcohol level was not immediately available.

Mr. Martins is a resident of Irvington, according to police and public records. 

In a statement issued through a spokesman for the company, Mr. Martins said: "This is a legal matter, and I've been advised not to discuss it at this time."

Mr. O'Leary was unable to provide information on whether anyone else was in the car with Mr. Martins at the time of his arrest. He was one of 14 people arrested among several checkpoints that evening, according to Mr. O'Leary.

Police said the charge was a misdemeanor because it was Mr. Martins's first offense.

The Danish-born Mr. Martins was named ballet master of NYCB in 1981 by the company's founder, George Balanchine. He has choreographed more than 80 ballets. 

Prior to assuming the directorship, he was a principal dancer with the company, with which he became associated after being invited by Mr. Balanchine to perform as a guest artist. 

Both Mr. Martins's wife,  Darci Kistler, and his son,  Nilas Martins, are former New York City Ballet principals. 

Both Ms. Kistler and Nilas Martins retired from the company last summer.

Mr. Martins has been arrested once before, after being accused of assault by Ms. Kistler in 1992. Those charges were later withdrawn.
