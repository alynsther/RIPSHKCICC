Rockspring Property Investment Managers LLP, a private-equity real-estate investment group based in London, is expanding its business in the Netherlands with the opening of an Amsterdam office and the €44.25 million ($60.54 million) acquisition of the Bossche Boulevard shopping center in Den Bosch, according to people familiar with the situation.

The acquisition was made on behalf of Rockspring's PanEuropean Property fund, and marks the firm's plan to double the size of its Dutch portfolio in the next two years. Rockspring funds now operate a Dutch portfolio of about €135 million, a tiny portion of the group's €7.4 billion in total assets under management. 

The Bossche Boulevard shopping center boasts of 40,000 square meters of shopping space. Its tenants include DiY Praxis, Prenatal, Kwantum, Trendhopper and Brugman Keikens. In addition to the existing retail space, the center also has about 13,000 square meters of warehouse and ancillary office space, which Rockspring says could be converted into retail. 

Rockspring intends to focus on shopping centers and retail parks as it builds out its portfolio in the Netherlands. To spearhead the drive, Rockspring has hired  Laurien Van Wieringen, who has been with Rockspring since 2007, to oversee asset management and identify acquisitions in the region from the company's new Amsterdam office.
