The story of how Redwood City became home to a salt-making operation began hundreds of years ago, when the native Ohlone people gathered the salt left as water evaporated around the edges of San Francisco Bay. 

Salt making didn't become an attractive business until the discovery of the Comstock lode in the 1850s, which set off a frenzied silver rush in Nevada, writes Mark Kurlansky in "Salt: A World History." The favored technique for separating out the silver required lots of salt, and salt prices skyrocketed. Entrepreneurial Californians quickly rediscovered what the Ohlone had known: The Bay Area's abundant sunlight and wind are perfect for salt making.

Early salt operations were small and makeshift, with workers using picks and shovels to break big salt chunks into smaller crystals, according to Morton Satin, vice president of science and research at the Salt Institute, a trade group. Among them was the Redwood City Salt Works, which opened in 1901.

With the end of the silver rush the salt industry focused on other buyers, including chemical producers, paper makers and sellers of table salt and salty snacks. Consolidation followed the invention of a mechanical salt harvester in the 1930s. The Leslie Salt Co. bought Redwood City Salt Works in 1941 and Cargill bought Leslie Salt in 1978. 

The shrinking of some traditional West Coast salt buyers, like paper makers and some chemical producers, cut demand for industrial salt, and a giant salt works in Baja, Mexico, boosted competition, said Lori Johnson, a Cargill spokeswoman. The company still uses ponds at its Redwood City site to concentrate bay water into salty brines, but its main salt operation these days is across the bay in Newark.
