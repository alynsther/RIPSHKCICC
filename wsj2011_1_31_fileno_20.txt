MUMBAIâ€“India's largest power producer NTPC Ltd. Monday posted a marginal growth in third-quarter net profit, topping analysts' estimates, as its sales rose from a year earlier. 

The state-run company's net profit for the October-December period rose to 23.71 billion rupees ($516 million) from 23.65 billion rupees a year earlier. 

Sales during the quarter rose to 134.21 billion rupees from 111.84 billion rupees, NTPC said in a statement. 

NTPC was expected to report a net profit of 21.18 billion rupees, according to the average estimate in a poll of 17 analysts. 

NTPC is also India's largest coal-based power producer, with about 80% of its installed generating capacity coal-based and the remainder gas-based. 

The company has a generation capacity of 33,194 megawatts, including its units and joint ventures, and expects to reach 128 gigawatts by 2032. 

NTPC added 1,500 MW of projects up to December in the current financial year, and is expected to add another 1,000 MW in the last quarter of the year, analyst  Satyam Agarwal of Mumbai-based brokerage  Motilal Oswal said in a note. 

Total expenses rose 21% to 102.6 billion rupees, the bulk of which was in fuel costs, which rose 23% to 83.39 billion rupees. 

While domestic coal production has been constrained, global coal prices rose sharply in the quarter, affecting imports by Indian companies. "According to estimates by the Indian coal minister, the country's coal deficit is forecast to increase to 104 million tons in the next fiscal year, a 24% increase from approximately 84 million tons this fiscal year," Barclays Capital said in a January note. 

NTPC's interest and finance charges rose to 4.93 billion rupees from 3.42 billion rupees a year earlier. Total tax expenses rose to 10.39 billion rupees from 7.76 billion rupees. 

India's federal government on Aug. 21 scrapped NTPC's Loharinag Pala hydroelectric project, which was under construction in Uttaranchal state, as environmentalists protested about the impact of diverting a river for the project. 

NTPC said it expects expenses on the project to be reimbursed after the power ministry asked it to discontinue the project due to environmental issues. India's flagship power producer is trying to diversify into hydro, renewable and nuclear power to cut its dependence on coal. 

India's current generation capacity is about 167 GW and it plans to add 62 GW over five years to March 2012 and another 100 GW from April 2012 to March 2017. Its aim is to combat peak power shortages, boost industrialization and provide millions of rural households with electricity. 

Shares of NTPC closed down 2.90% at 188.90 rupees Monday on the Bombay Stock Exchange, while the sensitive index was down 0.4%.
