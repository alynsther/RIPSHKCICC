With the seventh Rugby World Cup just nine months away, the three leading Southern Hemisphere countries enter 2011 as the top three teams in the world rankings and favorites to lift the Webb Ellis Trophy in New Zealand.

For Europe's leading rugby union nations, the annual Six Nations Championship, which begins in February, will likely show whether any of the Northern Hemisphere's traditional powers can emerge as a realistic contender for the sport's biggest prize.

Largely as a result of the exceptional promise shown in the Investec International Series in November, England is considered the favorite by oddsmakers and best-priced at 9/4 with Totesport. France, at 13/5, and 7/2-shot Ireland are the closest challengers in the betting.

This year, England has the crucial advantage of hosting 'Le Crunch'—its annual meeting with France—at Twickenham, a ground where the English have lost only one of six Six Nations meetings with Les Bleus in the past decade. That suggests England should have enough to win the championship for the first time since 2003, although an English Grand Slam or Triple Crown remains unlikely. 

Ireland will be formidable opponents at its new Lansdowne Road stadium while Wales has triumphed on the last three occasions that England has visited Cardiff's Millennium Stadium—a repeat of that fixture opens the tournament this year.

England winger Chris Ashton's sublime length-of-the-pitch try against Australia in November announced him as one of this sport's most dangerous players and he is rightly favorite to be the top try-scorer in the 2011 Six Nations. 

Mr. Ashton is available at 6/1 with Sportingbet, but Ireland's Keith Earls is also worthy of consideration at 12/1: He has scored six tries in his 13 Tests to date.
