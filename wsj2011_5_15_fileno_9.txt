New York Rangers forward  Derek Boogaard, a 6-foot-8 enforcer known for his intimidating presence on the ice, died on Friday. He was 28. Boogaard, a native of Saskatchewan, was found in Minnesota, where he made his offseason home. The Rangers announced his death in a statement on Friday night but did not provide further details. 

Boogaard began his NHL career with the Minnesota Wild and appeared in 255 games with the Wild from 2005 to 2010. He played 22 games for the Rangers this season, his first in New York. 

"Derek was an extremely kind and caring individual. He was a very thoughtful person, who will be dearly missed by all those who knew him," Rangers General Manager  Glen Sather said in a statement.

In a statement, the Minnesota Wild said Boogard "was a fan favorite during his five seasons with the Wild and will be greatly missed here in Minnesota and throughout the NHL." 

In many ways, Boogaard was the prototypical enforcer--when he started his Rangers career, he hadn't scored a goal in 222 games. In an interview in September with the Journal, Boogaard his role on the ice was to "regulate things and keep things honest." He tallied 589 penalty minutes in his career and was known as one of the premier fighters in the league. He finally scored again on on Nov. 9 against the Washington Capitals but he did not play a game after Dec. 9 when he injured his shoulder fighting. He stayed around the team for most of the season, rehabilitating his shoulder and skating but not playing due to the injury.
