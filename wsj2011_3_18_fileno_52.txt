Brandon Knight missed his first seven shots and even found himself on the bench in the final minute against Princeton.

His confidence could have been shaken. His ego could have been bruised. His head could have been a mess.

Yeah, right. One of the most talented freshmen in the country responded with the biggest shot of his career.

Knight, held scoreless for more than 39 minutes, made a driving layup with 2 seconds remaining to lift No. 4 seed Kentucky to a 59-57 win over 13th-seeded Princeton in the second round of the NCAA tournament Thursday.

The Tigers (25-7) shut Knight down much of the game, doubling him on drives, putting a hand in his face on the perimeter and contesting every shot.

Kentucky coach John Calipari, who proclaimed, "You can't count on freshmen" a day earlier, pulled him down the stretch. But with the game on the line, Calipari put the ball in Knight's hands.

He delivered, and Kentucky (26-8) advanced to face West Virginia in the third round Saturday.
