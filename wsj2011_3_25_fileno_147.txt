MUMBAI â€“ Cotton prices in India, the world's second-largest producer by volume, are likely to remain firm in the next three months due to strong demand from domestic mills, industry executives said Friday. 

The price of the widely traded Shankar-6 variety of raw cotton has more than doubled in the past one year to a record high of more than 61,000 rupees ($1365) per 356 kilograms in the local market. 

Demand for Indian cotton soared after floods damaged crops in big producers China, Pakistan and Australia. Local buying too has picked up, boosting prices. 

Domestic mills still have to cover huge quantities of cotton to meet their requirements until the new crop arrives in October, said  Mohit Shah, director at Gill & Co. Pvt., one of India's leading cotton exporters. 

A major chunk of India's cotton output, estimated to be 31.2 million bales in the crop year ending Sept. 30, has already arrived in the market and daily arrivals are likely to decrease gradually in the coming weeks. 

Cotton arrivals in Indian markets totaled 25.6 million bales between Oct. 1 and March 20. Each bale weighs 170 kilograms. 

Traders are holding some stocks and domestic mills are finding it difficult to buy cotton due to limited transaction and tight money flow, an industry executive, who declined to be named, said. 

"Fundamentally, you don't have any reason for prices to come down,"  A. Ramani, joint secretary of the South India Cotton Association, said. 

Gill & Co.'s Shah said any drop in prices will find underlying support from inventory re-building or stocking by mills. 

"Prices are bound to be strong beyond April. I won't be surprised if some record prices are registered in May or June," Mr. Ramani said. 

The government-run Cotton Advisory Board said in late February that consumption by local mills is expected to rise 12% in 2010-11 from the previous year to 23.2 million bales.
