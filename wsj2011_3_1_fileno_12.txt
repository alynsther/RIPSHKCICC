WASHINGTON--The White House on Monday said "exile" is an option for Libya's Col. Moammar Gadhafi, in another sign that the U.S. is stepping up the pressure on the embattled leader in the wake of his regime's bloody crackdown against anti-government rebels. 

"Exile is certainly one option for" Gadhafi, White House Press Secretary  Jay Carney told reporters. 

Carney said the U.S. is "actively considering" instituting a no-fly zone over Libya, and that the U.S. is also "looking very closely" at sending humanitarian aid to opposition forces in the country. 

President Barack Obama over the weekend slapped sanctions on Gadhafi and his regime, and the administration is working with its allies to do the same.

U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met with European Union officials in Geneva, Switzerland, Monday. The EU said it will approve wider sanctions against Libya, and Mrs Clinton said the U.S. is ready to send humanitarian aid to Libya's borders with Egypt and Tunisia, where thousands are trying to flee the country. The United Nations said on Sunday that 100,000 people had fled the violence in Libya. 

The US. has said that it's considering a number of options for Libya. The Pentagon said Monday it's moving some armed forces in the region near Libya in case they're needed.

Defense Department spokesman Col.  Dave Lapan said Pentagon planners are working on various options and contingency plans as the violence aimed at overthrowing the government continues in the North African nation, the Associated Press reported. Lapan told reporters Monday that as part of that planning, the Pentagon is repositioning some naval and air forces.

 The U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Susan Rice, will brief reporters at the White House later Monday about the U.N.'s actions toward Libya. She will also provide details of Obama's meeting, scheduled for Monday afternoon, with U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon.
