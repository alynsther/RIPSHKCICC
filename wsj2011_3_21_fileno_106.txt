Marian Gaborik and Ryan Callahan scored power-play goals 11 seconds apart during a four-goal third period, and the Rangers extended their winning streak to a season-high four games with a win over the Pittsburgh Penguins on Sunday.

Gaborik slammed home a rebound of a Brandon Dubinsky shot to tie the game at 2 during a 5-on-3 power play. Callahan scored the game-winner, his 23rd goal, from a bad angle on the goal line just after the penalty expired.

New York's Henrik Lundqvist made 38 saves in his 17th consecutive start.
