PARISâ€”A French court of appeal cleared two French businessmen of charges of illicit arms trade with Angola, a ruling that could help to defuse lingering tensions between France and the oil-rich West African nation.

The appeals court also cleared a senior French politician of all charges related to the case.

In 2009, a first-instance court had sentenced businessmen Pierre Falcone and Arcadi Gaydamak to six years each for arranging a weapons shipment valued at $790 million to Angola in the mid-1990s. Mr. Falcone was found guilty of influence-peddling, with judges finding he used proceeds to pay commissions to French politicians and civil servants in return for favors.

Lawyers for Messrs. Falcone and Gaydamak argued that the two men had acted on an Angolan government mandate, and that France had no say in the transaction because the weapons never transited through French territory.

The appeals court cleared the two of illicit-arms-trade charges. Mr. Falcone's prison sentence was cut to 30 months from six years, while Mr. Gaydamak's six-year sentence was halved. The court hasn't yet released its motivations so the details of the verdict aren't yet known.

French conservative senator and former interior minister  Charles Pasqua, who in the first-instance ruling was sentenced to three years in prison, two of them suspended, for influence-peddling in connection with the arms trade of Messrs. Falcone and Gaydamak in 2009, was cleared of all charges.

France's protracted investigation into the arms trade had irked Angola, which complained that Paris was meddling in its domestic affairs. In 2009, Angola had asked, without success, that the case be dismissed on the grounds that most of the facts uncovered by the French-led investigation had been classified as secret documents in Angola.
