Dark rockers Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds are putting a high gloss on their back catalog. On Tuesday the band releases the latest in an ongoing series of reissues. Each of the albums in this installment—"Let Love In" (1994), "Murder Ballads" (1996), "The Boatman's Call" (1997), "No More Shall We Part" (2001)—has been remastered and paired with a DVD featuring a surround-sound version of the album.

Founding Bad Seed Mick Harvey oversaw the new mixes. Mr. Cave reminisced for the sake of new liner notes, revealing that he wrote "Nobody's Baby Now" for Johnny Cash but decided to keep it for himself. Such context keeps his Stygian reputation intact—he describes the "high body count" and "nihilism and unnecessary violence" of certain lyrics—but there are glimpses of Nick Cave, everyday guy. He wrote the twisted hymn "God Is in the House" while honeymooning in the American West, where he was charmed by small towns and their residents. "But like anything, there was a darker side," he hastens to add. 

The Bad Seeds formed in 1983, but these midperiod reissues mark "the most conspicuous turning point" in Mr. Cave's songwriting, drummer James Sclavunos says, where often-macabre storytelling gives way to more personal lyrics, including his exploration of Christianity on "The Boatman's Call."

Newly polished songs such as "Red Right Hand," which features Mr. Cave's brimstone vocals and a Latin swing, highlight the band's attention to detail in the studio. But for every painstakingly layered song, there's a track made fast and reckless. Mr. Sclavunos says wryly: "It's not like we were preciously examining every facet of our diamond."

Mr. Sclavunos expects the Bad Seeds to reconvene in the coming year to resume work on their founder's original formula: "Nick's going to write some songs. And we're going to play them."
