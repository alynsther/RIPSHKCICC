LONDONâ€”The euro zone's manufacturing sector grew at a more rapid pace in April, although slowdowns in Spain and Italy underlined continued divergences in economic growth across the bloc. 

Markit Economics Monday said its purchasing managers' index for the euro zone's manufacturing sector rose to 58 from 57.5 in March, indicating that factory output rose at a faster rate than in the previous month. 

The final PMI was higher than the preliminary estimate of 57.7 released last month. A reading above 50 indicates that activity increased, while a reading below 50 indicates that it decreased. 

However, the pickup in growth was largely driven by German and French factories, while activity in the Italian and Spanish manufacturing sectors grew at a slower pace. 

That widening divergence will make it difficult for the European Central Bank to set an interest rate that is appropriate to all of the euro zone's 17 members. The ECB raised its key rate last month, and is expected to hike again soon after data released Friday showed the annual rate of inflation in the currency area rose to 2.8% in April, a 30-month high. 

The manufacturing PMI for Germany rose to 62.0 from 60.9 in March, a stronger-than- expected outcome, as was the manufacturing PMI for France, which rose to 57.5 from 55.4, reaching a five-month high. 

By contrast, the manufacturing PMI for Italy fell to 55.5 from 56.2, while the manufacturing PMI for Spain fell to 50.6 from 51.6.
