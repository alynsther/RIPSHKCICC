When the Mets drafted Ike Davis in 2008, the concern was whether he would hit enough to play as a corner infielder. But early returns have been so impressive that fans now ask if he can be even more—a franchise cornerstone for the next decade.

Davis, the Mets' first baseman, is nearing 750 career plate appearances, and he has an on-base plus slugging percentage of .816. To see just how good that is, we looked at other corner infielders who made their debuts between 1990 and 2000 and who had an OPS of between .800 and .850 for their first 750 career trips to the plate. This time period was chosen to make it a similar era and so we could look at their careers with a bit of hindsight.

Eleven players made this list. Four— Jeff Bagwell, Chipper Jones, Jason Giambi and Carlos Delgado—became significantly better over the years, with a career OPS at least 75 points better than their impressive starts. Two others—Scott Rolen and Richie Sexson—have been frequent All-Star candidates. Only three of these comparable hitters finished with a career OPS below .800, and one of them—Bill Mueller—was thwarted by injuries as much as by enemy pitchers.

Like Darryl Strawberry, another home-grown Mets star, Davis will have to overcome a ballpark with a reputation for swallowing long flies that would find the seats in most places. But his power is also prodigious enough to defy even the most pitcher-friendly environment. So the net outcome for Davis shouldn't be significantly altered even if he calls Citi Field home for many years to come.
