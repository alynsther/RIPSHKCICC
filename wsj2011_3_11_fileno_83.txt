For his latest film, "Win Win," Tom McCarthy had an unlikely mix of inspirations: difficult economic times—and the pressures of high-school wrestling.

 "Wrestling was the first thought, because we thought it was just funny," says the 45-year-old actor (HBO's "The Wire"), screenwriter (Pixar's "Up") and director ("The Visitor"), who wrote the script with his high-school wrestling buddy Joe Tiboni. "But thematically it worked, too," adds Mr. McCarthy, "because we're following a man literally grappling with how to sustain the life he thought he deserved." 

In the movie, which opens March 18 in New York and Los Angeles and will go wider in subsequent weeks, Paul Giamatti plays an elder-care attorney and wrestling coach who comes up with an unethical scheme to keep his family afloat—and win the big tournament. Things don't work out as planned.

 While developing the story, Mr. McCarthy remembers a crucial moment when he and Mr. Tiboni returned to their own New Jersey high school. "And there was this 'wall of honor,' and just above my picture was Andrew Fastow, the CFO of Enron," he recalls. "Joe and I talked a lot about Enron, and I'm a believer that all our economic problems don't come from evil men in evil places, but good men who make bad decisions." 

"Win Win" is Mr. McCarthy's funniest movie. When it premiered at Sundance, many critics drew comparisons to "Little Miss Sunshine," with its unconventional family dynamics and ultimately triumphant spirit. But Mr. McCarthy says of his debut film "The Station Agent": "People read that script and thought, 'Oh my God, a depressed dwarf living in a train depot,' but I knew there were would be a lot of laughs," 

"Humor is like music," he adds. "If you can get an audience laughing together, they'll really go with your story."
