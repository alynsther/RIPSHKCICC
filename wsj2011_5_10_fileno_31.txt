NEW DELHI â€“ An Indian ministerial panel may meet next week to make a decision on London-listed miner Vedanta Resources PLC's proposal to acquire a majority stake in Cairn Energy PLC's Indian unit, the oil minister said Tuesday. 

"The meeting could happen on May 17 or May 18," S. Jaipal Reddy told reporters. 

A separate ministerial panel is also expected to meet on May 17 and May 18 to consider raising the prices of diesel, kerosene and cooking gas. 

Vedanta is awaiting the government's approval to complete the deal. 

Under the deal proposed in August, Vedanta wants to acquire up to 60% in Cairn India Ltd., mainly from parent Cairn Energy and partly through an open offer to Cairn India shareholders. 

Cairn Energy expects the Indian government to clear the deal by May 20, its chief executive, Bill Gammell, told reporters. 

Cairn Energy extended the deadline for the stake sale by more than a month to May 20 in order to accommodate the completion of an open offer by Vedanta unit Sesa Goa Ltd., and as the Indian ministerial panel scrutinized the deal. 

Mr. Gammell declined comment when asked if the deadline will need to be extended beyond May 20. 

"Cairn continues to work in a positive and constructive manner with the government of India to secure the necessary approvals to complete the Vedanta transaction," Cairn Energy said in a statement.
