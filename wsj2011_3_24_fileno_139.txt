Salt House, a nearly five-year-old restaurant in San Francisco's South of Market district, caters to a buzzing lunchtime crowd. 

Situated in a 104-year-old renovated industrial building, Salt House features a soaring ceiling, raw steel beams and rough brick walls. Diners can sit at a long communal area near the bar or choose traditional tables. 

An eclectic menu is served at lunch, when the restaurant draws workers from nearby financial-services firms. Recent entrees included salmon on a puree of Jerusalem artichokes and Brussels sprouts ($24), lasagna alla Bolognese ($20) and Moroccan chicken salad with chickpeas ($18). 

Seafood is a customer favorite, said  Jonathan Farr, the restaurant's general manager. "Crispy shrimp salad is a signature dish," he said.

Drew Alltizer, who works across the street at Ernst & Young, said he had eaten at Salt House a half dozen times and favored its meaty hamburger with onion rings. The restaurant's only drawback, he said, is its noise level. "It's a little loud for a business discussion, but I do it anyway," he said.

Mr. Farr said he got the occasional complaint about noise but added that there was little the restaurant could do, because "acoustically, our building is a little complicated."

Salt House, at 545 Mission St. in San Francisco, is open for lunch from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m., Monday through Friday.
