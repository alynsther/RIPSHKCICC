Asian shares slumped as China's unexpected trade deficit for February and escalating fighting in Libya sparked selloffs. A Moody's downgrade of Spain's government-bond ratings also weighing on sentiment.

In Shanghai, stocks snapped a four-session win streak after the country posted a $7.3 billion trade deficit for February, with exports and imports growth slowing sharply in a month marked by the Chinese New Year holidays. Markets expected a surplus. The Shanghai Composite index shed 1.5% to 2957.14.  China Coal Energy fell 3%,  Citic Securities

"The trade-deficit data are likely to hurt the market sentiment as [they] indicate the liquidity conditions may be not as ample as some investors think," said Guotai Junan Securities analyst  Shi Weixiang.

"One thing we are more certain about is that China's trade surplus is most likely to decline at a faster rate than anyone expected this yearâ€¦A much smaller trade surplus means that the external pressure on yuan appreciation would be less," said  Wei Yao, China economist at Societe Generale in Hong Kong.

The data hit regional markets already on edge about crude-oil prices, as investors worried that any slowdown in the world's second-largest economy could crimp global economic growth.

Nikkei Stock Average declined 1.5% to 10434.38, the lowest close since Feb. 3. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 fell 1.4% to 4699.68, the steepest one-day slide since November. Taiwan's Taiex slid 1.2%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell 0.8% to 23614.89 and India's Sensex shed 0.8% to 18327.98, both extending losses after Moody's Investors Service lowered Spain's government-bond rating by one notch to Aa2 from Aa1, while also placing the new rating on a negative watch.

In Seoul, the Kospi fell 1% to 1981.58, leaving it 6.3% below the record close of Jan. 19. Persistent selling by offshore investors hurt shares. Technology stocks weakened on concerns about first-quarter earnings. Samsung Electronics shed 2.7%. LG Electronics fell 1.8%.

In Sydney, mining stocks continued to lose ground as demand was hurt by the Chinese trade figures and data showing the number of Australians employed fell by 10,100 in February, compared with an expected rise of 20,000.  BHP Billiton fell 3% and  Fortescue Metals Group

Shares of Japan's Osaka Securities Exchange rallied 6.9% following reports that it will begin talks on integration with the unlisted Tokyo Stock Exchange.

In New Zealand, the NZX 50 fell 0.2% after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand cut its target interest rate by 0.5 percentage point to 2.5% in a bid to help the domestic economy in the aftermath of the Christchurch earthquake last month. The move dragged on the local currency but failed to support stocks. Blue-chip plays were mixed.  Telecom Corp. of New Zealand fell 1.9%, while Nuplex Industries shed 2.5%.

"Today's rate cut should be seen as the [central bank] taking an insurance measure," said  Khoon Goh, senior economist at ANZ in Wellington. "The additional policy support is to shore up confidence and help the country manage the near-term disruptions caused by the earthquake."

In other markets, Singapore's Straits Times index gave up 0.6% to 3075.44, Indonesian shares fell 0.3% to 3587.65 and Thailand's SET rose 0.2% to 1019.22. Philippine shares rose 0.8%.
