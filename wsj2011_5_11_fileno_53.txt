In light of the fact that Alex Rodriguez has one extra-base hit in his past 15 games, his single up the middle today probably doesn't count as a breakout moment.

But considering it came with the bases loaded, with two strikes, took patience and discipline and drove in the two runs that gave the Yankees a 3-1 win over Kansas City—it's a step.

Rodriguez has been ice cold after a powerful start to the season, his average down to .263 before the game—prompting manager Joe Girardi to issue this lukewarm defense: "Will he get it back? Yeah, I believe he'll get it back. Will it be today? I don't know if it will be today," Girardi said. It was today—and just in time. 

Starter Freddy Garcia pitched well again for the Yankees, and reliever David Robertson struck out two men with the bases loaded to preserve the lead once Garcia was gone.
