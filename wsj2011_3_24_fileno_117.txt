The population of the nine-county Bay Area is growing at its slowest pace since the U.S. Census Bureau began tracking it in the mid-1800s. The region had 7.15 million people in 2010, up just 5.4% from 6.78 million at the last census, in 2000. Until now, the slowest-growing decade was the 1930s. During the past decade, people eschewed the costly Bay Area in favor of inland areas, said  Hans Johnson, a senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California. That stands in contrast to the 1990s, when the region's population grew 13% thanks to the high-tech boom. One trend that has continued, though, is that the region is growing more diverse, with ever-increasing Latino and Asian populations.
