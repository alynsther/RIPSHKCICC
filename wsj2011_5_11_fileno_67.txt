Sleepless New Yorkers have long turned to 24-hour diners to fuel their late-night cravings. Coppelia opened this April, bringing a Latin-American flavor to the classic Chelsea diner. There, customers can order omelettes and pancakes, or opt for huevos rancheros and arroz con pollo.

Coppelia, a new 24-hour restaurant in Chelsea, puts a Latin spin on American diner classics.

Chef Julien Medina is a Mexico City-born, French-trained chef who prepared Japanese dishes at SushiSamba. At Coppelia, the specials feature a different country each day: chicken enchiladas on Tuesdays, beef arepas on Thursdays. 

"It's more like our take of a Cuban or Latin-American diner. It's very authentic and dishes are straightforward," Mr. Medina said.

Most dishes cost less than $10, including some of Mr. Medina's favorites: Cubano sandwiches, burgers and sweet-corn empanadas. The mac and cheese, topped with crispy pork belly, proves that comfort food doesn't have to be bland.

Pastry chef Pichet Ong offers up ice-creams and sorbets with flavors such as apple mojito, Ovaltine and rum raisin. But even chocolate lovers should try the olive-oil terrajas, a Cuban version of French toast served with blackberries.

 Coppelia, 207 W. 14th St., between Seventh and Eighth avenues, is open 11 a.m. to  11 p.m. daily. It plans to stay open 24 hours a day in June.
