PARISâ€”France said Thursday that it formally recognizes the Libyan National Council, the main opposition force to Col. Moammar Gadhafi, as the "legitimate representative of the Libyan people."

France is the first country to officially recognize the council. The move comes a day ahead of a European Union summit, during which EU leaders are expected to discuss the bloc's policy towards Libya.

France will send an ambassador to Benghazi, the Libyan coastal city where the council is based, and the council will appoint an ambassador to Paris, a spokesman for France's President Nicolas Sarkozy said.

The announcement came shortly after Mr. Sarkozy met with two council representatives in Paris. One of the council's representatives, Ali Essaoui, said he hoped the French ambassador to Libya would soon be able to move to Tripoli.
