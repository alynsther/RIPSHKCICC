ZURICHâ€”The Swiss government Thursday significantly raised its forecast for economic growth this year, but it warned that the strong franc and Japan's nuclear crisis could undermine exports and growth. 

The Swiss government agency Seco said it expects the country's gross domestic product will expand by around 2.1% this year, up from a previous estimate of 1.5%. It maintained its GDP growth forecast for next year at 1.9%. 

"Helped by the global economy, Switzerland has achieved robust expansion despite the strength of the Swiss franc, though the strength of the currency still poses a threat to exports and could lead to a cooling of the economy," the government said. 

Seco said it expects the unemployment rate to average 3.2% this year, compared with a previous estimate of 3.4%, and 3.3% in 2012, down from the prior 3.4% projection. 

Consumer price inflation is expected at 1.0% in 2011 and at 0.9% next year, compared with 0.7% and 0.8% respectively in the previous forecast. 

  Jan Poser, chief economist at Bank Sarasin & Cie, said the revision wasn't a surprise and "reflect[s] the recent strong economic data out of Switzerland."

Seco said the nuclear crisis in Japan threatens to slow the global economy's recovery from the financial crisis, which could hurt Swiss exports. 

The combined impact of the Japanese earth quake and tsunami has caused "immeasurable human suffering and massive economic damage," Seo said. 

Although it is unlikely these developments alone will have a major effect on Swiss and global growth, "this estimate could change significantly in the case of an atomic catastrophe in Japan."

An escalation of the nuclear crisis could trigger a long-lasting economic crisis in Japan that would hurt the global economy, it said.
