"Dizzying" is the adjective Mark Morris used to describe his new piece, "Festival Dance," which will have its world premiere March 17 as part of the company's 30th anniversary season. Part of what makes it so is the high number of entrances and exits the 12 dancers take, which we asked the choreographer to tabulate. 

Looking at the dance in this way, Mr. Morris reflected on the chaos management aspect of his profession. "Sometimes there is more activity off stage than on stage," he said. If, for instance, he needs a dancer who had exited stage right to enter stage left, that dancer must race around the back of the stage in time to enter again. That's a "crossover," he said, and "then you appear on the other side of the stage as calmly as possible. It's crazy."

Collisions happen. "You run, run, run across the stage and you leap off" into the wings where, he said, "there's a piece of lighting equipment called a shinbuster. It's very bright. It's blinding. It's terrible." 

Festival Dance is "extremely active in the wings," he said. "I like the idea of using the periphery of the stage. It gives the impression that there's a whole dance going on that you can't see."

When asked if all this qualified him for a career in, say, air-traffic control, Mr. Morris responded affirmatively. "But I think you have to be calmer than I am," he said. "I'd be screaming, 'You're going to crash! You're going to crash!'"
