California's attorney general has asked a federal appeals court to allow gay marriages to resume while the court considers the constitutionality of the state's voter-approved ban on same-sex unions.

Attorney General  Kamala Harris submitted a petition to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday.

The appeals court is considering the case after a judge struck down the ban last year. The court imposed a stay on that ruling during the appeals process.

In Tuesday's petition, Mr. Harris joined lawyers for the two gay couples who sued to overturn the ban in asking the court to lift the stay.

Mr. Harris, who previously served as San Francisco's district attorney, succeeded Gov. Jerry Brown as attorney general in January. Brown refused to defend the ban before the appeals court.
