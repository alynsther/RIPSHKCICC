MUMBAI â€“ Indian shares closed higher for the second straight session amidst choppy trade Wednesday, tracking advances in Asian markets and supported by gains in Reliance Industries, India's largest company by market capitalization. 

The Bombay Stock Exchange's Sensitive Index rose 30.30 points, or 0.2%, to close at 18469.95 after moving between 18303.80 and 18583.30. 

Trading volume on the BSE rose to 34.17 billion rupees ($756 million) from Tuesday's 28.68 billion rupees. Gainers outnumbered decliners 1,645 to 1,218, while 114 stocks were unchanged. 

On the National Stock Exchange, the 50-stock S&P CNX Nifty rose 10.20 points, or 0.2%, to end at 5531.00. 

In Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.4%, Japan's Nikkei was up 0.6%, while China's Shanghai Composite gained 0.1%. 

"It was a lackluster session and investors were waiting for more cues. Political concerns have been assuaged and that drove early advances, but investors used the gains to take some profit," said  Alex Mathews, head of research at Geojit BNP Paribas Financial Services. 

India's ruling Congress party said Tuesday it had clinched a deal with a key regional ally who had, over the weekend, threatened to pull its ministers out of the federal coalition in a row between the parties over seat-sharing in elections in Tamil Nadu state. 

Mr. Mathews expects further gains in coming sessions provided oil prices continue to soften. April Nymex light sweet crude oil futures fell nine cents at $104.93 a barrel on Globex, extending Tuesday's losses. 

Of the 30 Sensex constituents, 16 ended higher Wednesday. 

Reliance Industries, which has a 12% weight in the Sensex, rose 1.0% to 993.90 rupees after India's upstream regulator said the company may increase production of natural gas from April at the D6 block in the Krishna-Godavari basin, off India's east coast. 

"This is definitely positive for Reliance Industries, since the market wasn't expecting any change in production from current levels for the calendar year 2011," said  Jagdish Meghnani, an analyst at Mumbai-based Alchemy Share and Stock Brokers. 

Reliance Communications jumped 9.4% to 99.30 rupees after the company said it has signed loan papers for a $1.93 billion loan from China Development Bank. 

Real estate shares rose on bargain buying following recent sharp losses. DLF, the only property developer included in the Sensex, rose 1.3% at 225.30 rupees while the realty sub-index gained 1.7%. 

Mid-cap and small-cap shares also saw buying interest, but analysts expect the stocks to remain volatile in the medium term. "Right now we are going through an FII [foreign institutional investor] outflow phase and in such a scenario, liquidity shrinks quite a bit in these stocks, which is the main issue," said Pratik Gupta, head of equities at Deutsche Equities India. The mid-cap and small-cap sub-indexes gained 0.7% and 0.8%, respectively. 

Sensex losses were led by  Infosys Technologies, which fell on a round of profit booking following Tuesday's gains. The stock closed down 0.6% at 3,095.25 rupees.

Among other Sensex losers, Cipla finished 1.7% lower at 302.15 rupees.
