On Friday afternoon  Dave McVittie unveiled to the public 131 online posts that  Jared Loughner wrote on a forum within the game Earth Empires, an online game Mr. McVittie administers. 

The posts cover April through June 2010 and are from a game Mr. Loughner played on and off since he was a young teen. In these posts Mr. Loughner revealed violent thoughts about rape and hitting handicapped people, as well as more prosaic notes such as the amount of weight he could bench press. He also outlined the troubles he ran into with teachers at his community college (whom he called "pigs"), complained about being unemployed and poor, and on a spreadsheet appeared to compare the option of suicide against going to prison or getting a job. 

 Read the posts. Note: Material on this link includes profanity as well as references to violence and sex.  

The other members of the community who read the posts -- around 50 people -- at first considered his posts as jokes but then began to post that they thought he might be on drugs or have a mental disability. 

In a statement online, site owners wrote: "As a community, we are absolutely horrified that someone who had been part of our relatively small group could be involved in such a horrible act."

Mr. Loughner is accused of shooting U.S. Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and killing six others in Tucson Saturday. 

The Federal Bureau of Investigation requested Mr. McVittie to provide Mr. Loughner's posts on Jan. 12 to aid in their ongoing investigation of Mr. Loughner. The FBI declined to comment on the ongoing investigation. 

The Wall Street Journal had previously viewed and reported on these postings. In them, Mr. Loughner uses the pseudonym "Dare."
