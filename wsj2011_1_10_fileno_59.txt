DETROITâ€”U.S. light-vehicle sales in 2011 will be 12.8 million, a 10% increase over 2010,  William Strauss, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said Sunday.

Manufacturing and the industrial sector this year will again help drive economic growth, while new housing starts will continue to be about half as strong as long-term norms, Mr. Strauss said at a meeting of the Society of Automotive Analysts on the eve of the Detroit auto show.

The Federal Reserve's prediction for U.S. economic growth is for a range of 3% to 3.6% growth. Ford Motor Co., at the same conference, forecast U.S. economic growth as high as 4%.

"We are looking at an economy that will have pretty decent growth this year,"Mr. Strauss said. 

Separately, IHS Automotive forecast U.S. industry sales for 2011 of 13.1 million.

J.D. Power and Associates also forecast a 12.8 million vehicle U.S. market, but with a better chance for it to be higher than lower than that figure, said Jeff Schuster, a forecaster for the firm. 

"There is room for there to be a couple hundred thousand more vehicles at the end of the year," Mr. Schuster said. 

The European market, combining light commercial vehicles with cars and trucks, will be up very modestly, less than 1%, said Calum MacRae, of PriceWaterhouseCoopers Autofacts. 

Mr. MacRae said Germany's auto sales will rise 8%, pulling up Europe overall, while the rest of the major countries, including France, Spain and Italy will have lower sales.
