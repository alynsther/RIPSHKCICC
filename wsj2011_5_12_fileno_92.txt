Supporters of Off-Broadway's the New Group attended a gala at Capitale this week. Artistic Director Scott Elliot was proud to celebrate 16 years of "thoughtful and often really naughty shows."

He was dressed in a leather coat, cargo pants and some fancy kicks.  Where did they come from? "Yves Saint Laurent," he said. "And I work in nonprofit so that's a whole paycheck."

The evening was, in part, to honor the actor and playwright Wallace Shawn, whose plays are often performed by the company. Guests all seemed to have moments with Mr. Shawn to share. 

Matthew Broderick said he enjoys "running into him at Citarella and discussing vegetables." 

Marisa Tomei called him "ruthlessly compassionate." Christopher Sieber laid out his best lisped "inconceivable" from "The Princess Bride." 

 Actress Kristen Johnston said, "He gives the impression that he's not working, but basically I don't think there's been a television show he's not had a role in for 10 years. Leave some work for the rest of us Wally!"
