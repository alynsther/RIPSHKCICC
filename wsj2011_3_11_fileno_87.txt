 The Association of International Photography Art Dealers (Aipad) Photography Show, March 17-20, New York  

One of the photography world's biggest annual events unfolds in New York this weekend. Japanese artist Sohei Nishino's series "Diorama Map" will be in the U.S. for the first time. He depicts reimagined cities, most recently Istanbul, collaged from thousands of photos, then shot with a large-format camera. Also showing will be Sheila Rock's "Horse No. 1," and an original 1963 photo of Mao that was the inspiration for Warhol's portraits.

 'Frankenstein,' starting Thursday, movie theaters across the U.S.  

The stage version of "Frankenstein" directed by Danny Boyle ("Slumdog Millionaire," "127 Hours") has been a critics' darling and sell-out hit in London. Thursday, Americans curious about his stagecraft can see the production on movie screens, the latest installment of the National Theatre Live series, in which live performances are broadcast internationally. The play will be recorded twice, with Benedict Cumberbatch (TV's "Sherlock") and Jonny Lee Miller ("Trainspotting") switching off as Dr. Frankenstein and the Creature.

 'Physics of the Future: How Science Will Shape Human Destiny and Our Daily Lives by the Year 2001' by Michio Kaku, Tuesday 

In coming decades we may be able to live forever by downloading our brains into robot bodies, meet a live Neanderthal who's been genetically engineered in a lab and grown in a chimp's womb, and surf the Internet by blinking our eyes to scan images streamed onto contact lenses. Mr. Kaku, author of the best seller "Physics of the Impossible," interviewed 300 researchers in the fields of robotics, artificial intelligence, genetics, astrophysics and other cutting-edge disciplines for the book.
