HANOI â€“ Indian Finance Minister  Pranab Mukherjee said Thursday inflation is a major concern for the Indian economy. 

On the sidelines of an annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank in Hanoi, Mr. Mukherjee said that food and oil prices are the key drivers of inflation. 

"Oil price continuing to rise will make it difficult for us to both manage inflation and maintain economic growth," he said. 

He said that enhancing economic integration in the region will help in the fight against inflation.
