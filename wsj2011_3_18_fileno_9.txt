New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said Friday that nuclear regulators must conduct a comprehensive seismic study of the Indian Point nuclear plant before renewing its operating licenses. 

"We are demanding an open hearing" to be conducted by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to ensure the plant is prepared for potential earthquakes, Mr. Schneiderman said during a press conference.

 is trying to renew the licenses for the two reactors at its Indian Point Energy Center before they expire in 2013 and 2015. The 2,069 megawatt power plant provides nearly a third of the power in the nation's most densely populated major city. 

Safety concerns about operating the plant for an additional 20 years have mounted in the wake of the 9.0-magnitude earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan last week.  Tokyo Electric Power Co.

 is trying to prevent a meltdown and radiation leaks at its Fukushima Daiichi facility about 150 miles north of Tokyo. 

Indian Point is situated along the Hudson River near the Ramapo Fault, with more than 20 million people within a 50-mile radius. U.S. nuclear regulators have said that chances of a major earthquake rocking the facility are low, but they are reviewing new seismic data for this facility and about two dozen others. 

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who has advocated shutting down Indian Point, ordered a safety review of the facility on Thursday. 

In a response to Mr. Cuomo's order, Entergy said that Indian Point is designed to withstand earthquakes that are bigger than the region has ever seen, but that this area is not susceptible to the types of earthquakes and the tsunami seen in Japan.
