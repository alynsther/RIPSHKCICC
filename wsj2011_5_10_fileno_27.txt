NEW DELHI -- India's Bharat Forge Ltd has entered a joint-venture agreement with David Brown Group, a maker of industrial gear boxes.

The companies will have equal equity partnership in the venture, according to a press release. 

  Bharat Forge, which makes machine components for automotive and non-automotive sectors, through this move hopes to diversify into non-auto business sectors. The company also wants to supply equipment to India's fast-growing infrastructure market.

The joint venture will be called David Brown Bharat Forge Gear Systems India Ltd, and will supply gearboxes and other products to power, mining, defense and related companies.

  David Brown Bharat Forge will operate, initially, from Bharat Forge's current facilities. However, by the middle of next year, it would have its own dedicated site for gear-box assembly and testing.



 Corrections & Amplifications: An earlier version of this story inaccurately described David Brown Group as an automotive supplier.
