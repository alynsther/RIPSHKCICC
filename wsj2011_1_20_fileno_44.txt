The Bay Area is one of the U.S. regions with the biggest gaps between whites and blacks getting screened for colorectal cancer, according to a January study in the journal Cancer. In the San Francisco and San Jose areas, an estimated 33% and 29% of blacks were up-to-date on screenings, compared with 44% of whites in both cities. A few other areas of the country, including Atlanta and rural Georgia, also showed big differences.  Thomas Semrad, the study's author, says his research doesn't explain the big Bay Area disparity but suggests it could be linked to residential segregation related to the region's high cost of living: White people might be more likely to live in areas with greater access to screenings or where doctors are more likely to encourage screenings, he says.
