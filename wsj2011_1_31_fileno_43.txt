NEW DELHI -- The Asian Development Bank will lend India $7.4 billion to mostly fund projects to develop the country's shabby infrastructure that is hurting growth in Asia's third-largest economy.

Under the pact, the multilateral agency will spread the loans through 2011-2013 to help the Indian government finance projects aimed at reducing disparities between states, a statement from the ADB said Monday.

"In 2010, ADB approved loans amounting to $2.2 billion while its annual disbursement reached a record level of $1.7 billion," Hun Kim, ADB's country director for India said.

India plans to spend $1 trillion between 2012 and 2017 to develop its shabby infrastructure, which economists estimate to shave off two percentage points from the annual economic growth.

Investments in the country's roads, bridges and power plants are so far mostly funded out of local savings, which hover around 35% of the gross domestic product.

India is increasingly betting on private investors to pour in long-term capital, which has so far only trickled into the south Asian country due to bureaucratic red-tapism, a shallow local bond market and due to faulty project designs.

But multilateral agencies, such as the ADB and the World Bank, have stood by India's efforts to power the so-called inclusive growth that aims to lift the economic condition of millions of people in economically backward states to bring them at par with those in flourishing urban areas.

ADB in the statement said it will continue its projects in transportation, energy and urban works in states such as Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, among others, to help bridge the inter-state economic gap.

It said it will continue to provide assistance for the country's rural road development program in other states such as Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, and West Bengal, as well as for public resource management projects in Assam and Mizoram.
