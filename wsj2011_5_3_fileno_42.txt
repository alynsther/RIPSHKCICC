The struggling Detroit Tigers presented their necks to the Yankees all night, waiting for the AL East juggernaut to lower the axe. 

All night, the Yankees hesitated. They left 11 runners in scoring position through the ninth inning, failing to drive them in almost every time. 

It was tied 3-3 in the ninth when the Yankees finally broke through, as Nick Swisher grounded a ball up the middle and Mark Teixeira raced around third to slide in safe at home, giving the Yankees the lead that would turn into a 5-3 win. 

Bartolo Colon pitched seven strong innings to keep the Yankees in the game until the pivotal ninth. 

Mariano Rivera, automatic as usual, pitched a scoreless ninth to record his 11th save of the season.
