WASHINGTON—The International Monetary Fund said Wednesday it had approved a €476 million ($641 million), two-year arrangement for Macedonia under its precautionary credit line, the first time it has used the facility since its creation last year.

Unlike the IMF's traditional lending facilities, employed after a crisis besets a country, the precautionary credit line is designed to prevent crises. 

It's available to fund members with "sound economic fundamentals and policies" that don't have immediate financing needs but face the possibility of requiring emergency funding. Countries aren't expected to draw on the credit unless conditions deteriorate, but it may boost market confidence and ensure a country maintains access to private funding. First-year access would be about €396 million, and the remainder in the second.

  Naoyuki Shinohara, IMF's second deputy managing director said Macedonia had a solid economic track record, including low public debt and inflation, and a resilient banking system.

Mr. Shinohara said the government is committed to moderate fiscal policies and its exchange rate peg. "Based on these commitments, prospects for preserving macroeconomic stability and returning to more robust economic growth appear good," he said.

Although Macedonia's not expected to draw on the IMF resources, "Nevertheless, the availability of these resources, if needed, will provide important insurance against the possibility of adverse external developments," he said.
