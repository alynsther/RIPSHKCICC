Nostalgia for the Tax Reform Act of 1986 is running high in the nation's capital these days, and no wonder.

The '86 tax bill, which wiped out hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks and used the money to lower tax rates, was a triumph over partisanship and special interests. Today's Washington has been immobilized by a toxic mire of both, and a triumph would be welcome.

So events of a quarter-century ago are being re-examined, in search of lessons for the present. The Senate Finance Committee has been holding hearings on whether the glory of '86 can be re-created. Former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, an early hero of the tax-reform effort, has been consulting with Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner on the factors that led to the '86 success. And House Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp said last week he wanted to eliminate tax breaks and cut the top rate to 25%.

Could it happen again? Well, it's worth pointing out no one thought it could happen then. Long odds are the nature of the enterprise, for a simple reason: Every tax break is backed by an organized and passionate interest group, while lower rates benefit the not-so-organized general interest. In the battle between well-organized special interests and unorganized general interest, the handicap is clear.

Consider the list of the top 10 tax breaks, or "expenditures," as published by the Joint Committee on Taxation: 

• Deduction of mortgage interest on owner-occupied homes,

• Exclusion of employer contributions for health insurance

• Exclusion of retirement contributions and earnings

• Reduced rate of taxes on dividends and capital gains

• Exclusion of Medicare benefits

• Earned income credit

• Deduction of state and local taxes

• Deduction for charitable contributions 

• Child tax credit

• Exclusion of capital gains at death

There are good policy arguments for reining in, if not eliminating, a number of these, including the home-mortgage deduction, the deduction for high-end health plans, the deduction for state and local taxes, and the exclusion of capital gains at death. But the conflagration any such effort could ignite would make Wisconsin look like a pep rally.

Many of today's advocates argue tax overhaul is needed to encourage job creation and boost U.S. exports. They say U.S. corporate tax rates are the highest in the world, and heavy payroll taxes and benefits place a burden on any company wishing to hire here. But unless reformers take on some of the 10 tax breaks listed above, or go after the depreciation and extraction allowances that benefit manufacturers and energy companies, they'll need to find a new source of revenue. Either an energy tax, which would also encourage conservation, or a value-added tax, which would favor exports, could do the job. But again, the political hurdles are prodigious. 

Mr. Bradley says success in this uphill endeavor must begin with leadership. "You need a president to be for it," he says. "You need chairmen of the Finance and Ways and Means committees that are fully committed to it." Beyond that, "you need to have a structure that is conceptually sound and based upon a few principles against which you can measure success." In the '86 case, those principles were that "people with equal incomes should pay equal taxes," and that "the market is a more efficient allocator of resources than the Finance or Ways and Means Committee."

You also need something to appeal to the partisan impulses of both Republicans and Democrats. The partisan gulf that separated President Ronald Reagan from former House Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski was as great as that dividing President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner. Tax reform bridged the chasm by offering President Reagan the lower tax rates he eagerly sought, while giving Chairman Rostenkowski and the Democrats a promise of greater tax fairness.

In the end, though, the primary purpose of the tax system is to raise revenue to fund the government. The '86 overhaul was possible in large part because Democrats and Republicans agreed on a revenue goal: tax reform was to be "revenue neutral," raising neither more nor less money than the existing system. Congress had gone on a tax-cutting orgy in 1981, and then had to raise taxes in 1982 to stanch the fiscal hemorrhage. By the time tax reform came along, both sides were prepared to declare a truce.

No such truce exists today. Federal government spending, which hovered at about 20% of GDP for most of the postwar period, has now broken into the mid-20s. Demographics, combined with a bipartisan commitment to fund federal retirement programs and skyrocketing health costs, threatens to push it over 30%. 

The great battle of the coming decade isn't just over whether taxes are headed higher, but how much higher. And until that issue is resolved, any debate over revenue-neutral tax "reform" is just a sideshow.
