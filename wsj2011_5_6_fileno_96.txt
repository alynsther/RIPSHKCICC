Time-and-space-traveling alien Doctor Who, the main character of the inexhaustible British science-fiction series, has been portrayed by 11 actors and counting. Each incarnation of Doctor Who has its devoted fans, but many viewers love the dapper, adventurous version played by Jon Pertwee from 1971 to 1974. These two episodes showcase Mr. Pertwee's Doctor, outfitted with a ruffled shirt and bouffant.

With Father's Day on the horizon, a complete DVD set will be available—in a toolbox, of course—for this 1990s ABC sitcom, starring Tim Allen as a father-figure who plays with power tools and meets his faceless neighbor Wilson for advice at the picket fence whenever Tim ticks off his wife, Jill. 

Before Daniel Craig carried James Bond's gun, he wore a wig as 'Jemmy' Seagrave, Moll's fourth of five husbands, in the 1996 BBC Masterpiece Theater adaptation of Daniel Defoe's scandalous 1722 novel. This two-installment series also introduced Alex Kingston (who plays the irrepressible title character) to the U.S., predating her seven-year stint on "E.R."
