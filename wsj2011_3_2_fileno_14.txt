 continued its recall streak Wednesday saying it is voluntarily recalling about 35,000 vehicles in the U.S. and Canada over possible electrical shorts and fuel leaks that could cause fires. 

The company said 25,000 of its 2010 Ranger pickup trucks are being recalled for possible fuel line leaks in the engine compartment although Ford said it is not aware of any fires or injuries. About 9,100 Edge cross over SUVs, Lincoln MKX and Super Duty pickup trucks are also being recalled due to body control modules that were not properly inspected during an earlier recall. 

Owners will be notified in mid-March so they can take their vehicles to dealers for repairs.

This is the third recall the auto maker has issued in the past month. Ford recalled 280,000 F-150 pickup trucks to repair faulty door handles in early February followed by a second F-150 pickup recall for potential airbag problems. That recall covered 144,000 of the pickups.
