The 12 banks in the Federal Home Loan system plan to strengthen their capital levels, with each of the regional banks reserving at least 20% of their earnings in a restricted account. 

The move creates an additional buffer to help absorb anticipated losses, according to a statement from  John von Seggern, president and chief executive of the Council of FHLBanks. The plan is aimed at assuring a steady flow of funds to support housing and community development and reducing the possibility the regional cooperatives will require taxpayer assistance, he said. 

A higher reserve level could be required if an individual bank had annual losses that led to a decline in the restricted account. 

The FHL banks last week posted a combined 26% increase in fourth-quarter income and said operations remained steady in a tough economic environment. 

Local lending institutions in the U.S. borrow funds from the regional banks to finance housing, economic development and infrastructure. The government created the banks—along with the Federal Housing Administration—during the 1930s to help promote homeownership. 

The 12-bank system struggled through the recent financial crisis after building up large investment portfolios, and eight are now under regulatory orders or have voluntarily suspended dividends or the repurchase of excess stock. 

While not as high-profile as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, Congress and the Obama administration are looking to change the system as they consider a broader housing market overhaul.
