Mercedes-Benz India Pvt. Ltd. has priced the GL 500 SUV at 8.09 million rupees ($183,000) at showrooms in New Delhi while the SL 350 sedan will be sold for 9.85 million rupees, the local unit of Daimler said. 

Expansion in the Indian economy and a growing number of young entrepreneurs who are splurging on luxury goods is prompting auto makers such as Daimler, BMW, Audi AG, Bentley and Jaguar to introduce more luxury cars in Asia's third-biggest auto market. 

Maserati SpA, Ferrari SpA and South Korean motorcycle maker S&T Motors Co. are among the auto makers to have recently forayed into the Indian market.

Mercedes-Benz said the SL 350 model will be powered by a 3.5-liter gasoline engine, while the GL 500 will have a 5.4-liter gasoline engine. 

Daimler, which has been in India for more than 15 years, has been introducing more models to regain market share after losing its top position as the country's biggest luxury car maker to BMW recently.

Mercedes-Benz India sold 5,819 vehicles in 2010, up 80% from the previous year, while BMW's sales jumped 73% to 6,246 units, indicating a sharp rise in demand for premium vehicles.
