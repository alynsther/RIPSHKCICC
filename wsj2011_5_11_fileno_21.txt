MUMBAI --Max New York Life Insurance Co. has received regulatory approvals to sell a 4% stake to Axis Bank. 

The deal has received approvals from both the Reserve Bank of India and the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority, said Rajesh Sud, chief executive of Max New York. 

The insurer is a joint venture between Max India and New York Life International. Max India currently has a 74% stake in the insurer and New York Life 26%. 

Max India had in April last year said it will sell a 4% stake in the insurance company to Axis Bank subject to regulatory approvals. The lender and the local insurer had also entered into a 10-year tie-up to sell insurance policies. 

Mr. Sud declined to elaborate on the valuation of the stake but said the deal would bring in more capital for the company's growth. 

In the fiscal year ended March 31, Max New York Life's net profit jumped to 2.83 billion rupees from 240 million rupees the previous year, it said.
