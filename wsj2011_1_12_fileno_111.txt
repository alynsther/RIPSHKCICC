If it seems like the 2010 tennis season was basically a series of big events that ended with Rafael Nadal jumping up and down with a trophy, that's because it's pretty much true.

Mr. Nadal won the last three Grand Slam tournaments including a maiden U.S. Open championship, claimed a record-breaking sixth Monte Carlo title, lifted the Davis Cup for a second time in succession and finished the year as the world's No. 1 player.

When the Australian Open begins in Melbourne on Monday, there will be one story in town: can Mr. Nadal win Down Under and complete a feat that hasn't been achieved in the men's game since Rod Laver's 1968 Grand Slam—namely, the chance to hold all four majors at once?

It is two years since the Spaniard last won here but it's worth noting that Mr. Nadal was still recovering from a knee injury 12 months ago. With a clean bill of health this time around, he's worth backing at 9/4 with Coral. 

His biggest rival for this trophy—and for pretty much every trophy—is Roger Federer, who will be defending his sole Grand Slam title here. The 16-times major winner saw his extraordinary run of 23 consecutive Grand Slam semi-finals brought to an end last year, but he finished the season with a flourish by beating Mr. Nadal in ATP World Tour Finals in London.

Now the No. 2 player in the world rankings, Mr. Federer is 2/1 with oddsmakers to claim a 17th Grand Slam at Melbourne Park.

Andy Murray reached last year's final but was reduced to tears following a straight-sets defeat by Mr. Federer. The fifth seed also reached the semifinals at Wimbledon and looks a good bet to reach the same stage here at 2/1 with William Hill.

Juan Martín Del Potro, from Argentina, will play in his first Grand Slam following an extended layoff with a wrist injury. The 2009 U.S. Open champion enjoys the hard-court surface and is a good value each-way bet at 28/1 with Boylesports considering that he is as short as 16/1 with other bookmakers.
