 has named  Matt Seiler as chief executive of Mediabrands, a unit that oversees the ad holding company's media-buying businesses and some of its digital companies. 

Mr. Seiler, previously chief executive of Interpublic's media-buying firm UM, assumes a post that had been vacant since April. 

For Interpublic, leadership at its Mediabrands division is a critical role since it has been an area of strength for the New York ad conglomerate, helping to offset weakness at other parts of the company. 

The fourth-largest ad company in the world by revenue, Interpublic had been considering several internal candidates for the top Mediabrands role. It chose the 48-year-old Seiler in part because of his experience in rebuilding UM by winning a slew of new business from companies including L'Oreal SA,  MasterCard Inc.
