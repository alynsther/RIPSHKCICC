  Alcatel-Lucent Settles U.S. Bribery Charges  

The move comes after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and U.S. Justice Department made documents public last week alleging that French telecommunications company Alcatel-Lucent paid bribes to employees of Telekom Malaysia in exchange for nonpublic information. 

Axiata Group was part of Telekom Malaysia at the time of the alleged bribes. 

Last week, Alcatel-Lucent agreed to pay more than $137 million to settle charges it bribed foreign government officials in Latin America and Asia before 2006.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged that Alcatel-Lucent used consultants to pass more than $8 million to government officials in Costa Rica, Honduras, Malaysia and Taiwan in exchange for telecommunications contracts.

The Malaysian companies said they have jointly decided to appoint KPMG Corporate Services Sdn. Bhd. as forensic accountants and Shearn Delamore & Co. as legal advisers for the investigations. 

A spokesman for Alcatel-Lucent said in an emailed statement, "It would be inappropriate for us to comment on this, other than to say we will cooperate with investigations." 

"We have a zero-tolerance policy regarding bribery and corruption and a system in place with strong processes and training designed to prevent these types of situations in all aspects of our business," the statement added.
