Ancient Mexicans were gathering and eating chile peppers 9,000 years ago, but the pungent pods didn't make it to the rest of the world until Christopher Columbus introduced them in the early 16th century. Since then chiles have become an intricate part of cuisines as varied as those of Spain, Hungary, Turkey and Indochina. The authors of "Chasing Chiles"—Kurt Michael Friese (a chef), Kraig Kraft (an agroecologist) and Gary Paul Nabhan (an ethnobotanist)—observe that the chile has served as a vegetable (think grilled or stuffed peppers), a condiment (Tabasco), a pest repellent, a medicine (in parts of Africa chiles are a remedy for piles, though the cure may be worse than the disease) and even the poison on an archer's arrow tip. All of which explains why more than 25 million metric tons of chili peppers are harvested annually world-wide.

The authors of "Chasing Chiles" bring an interesting mix of perspectives to their subject as they take readers on a year-long road trip, visiting America's pepper-growing states and Mexico's chile zones in a van dubbed The Spice Ship. The text is peppered with practical advice: e.g., "a handy rule of thumb to judge any Mexican, Caribbean, or Central or South American restaurant is to check out their ceviche," a marinated seafood dish that is traditionally seasoned with chili peppers. Among the book's kitchen tips: Home cooks who want to make Xnipek, a distinctive salsa from the Yucatán, and who lack the region's bitter orange, can substitute fresh grapefruit, Florida orange and lime juices in a 2:1:1 ratio. In a short afterword, the authors offer five principles for "eating and growing food in ways that counter climate change." For some reason these do not include: no long trips in a van.
