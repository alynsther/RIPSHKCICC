FRANKFURT—The euro zone posted its largest external trade deficit on record in January as imports rose from a month earlier but exports fell sharply, official data showed Friday. 

Non-seasonally adjusted figures show the trade deficit widened to €14.8 billion ($20.75 billion) from €500 million in December, the largest deficit since comparable records began in January 1999, the European Union's Eurostat agency said. 

Exports totaled €124.5 billion in January, 27% higher than in the corresponding month last year but down sharply from €134.5 billion in December. Imports rose to €139.4 billion from €135.0 billion in December and were 29% higher on the year. 

However, on a seasonally adjusted basis, euro-zone exports rose to €139.4 billion, the highest level since comparable records began at the start of 1999, while imports rose to €142.7 billion, the highest level since July 2008, Eurostat said. 

The non-seasonally adjusted figures showed that in 2010 as a whole, the euro zone's trade balance swung to a deficit of €200 million from a surplus of €15.8 billion in 2009 mainly as a result of a larger deficit in trade of raw materials and energy. 

Separately, European Central Bank data showed the euro zone's current account deficit shrank sharply in January as the balance in trade of services moved into surplus. 

The euro zone saw a net outflow of portfolio investment in January, as investors shunned euro-zone debt amid worries about the solvency of some of its member countries and their banks. 

The current account deficit narrowed to €700 million in January from a revised deficit of €12.5 billion in December. 

That is the smallest shortfall since January 2010, when there was a surplus of €1.6 billion. The data are adjusted for seasonal effects and take account of the number of working days in each month. 

The ECB said that a deficit in current transfers was almost fully offset by surpluses in goods, services and income. 

The surplus in the trade of goods widened to €1.5 billion in January from €300 million the previous month, while December's €500 million deficit in services swung to a €4 billion surplus in January. 

In the euro zone's non-seasonally adjusted financial account, combined direct and portfolio investment showed net outflows of roughly €7 billion in January, compared with inflows of €42 billion in December. 

The data show investors shunned euro-zone debt, selling a net €28.7 billion in bonds and other debt instruments in January after being net buyers of €18.3 billion in December. 

That helped turn December's €23.5 billion net inflow of portfolio investment into a net outflow of €14.7 billion in January. 

Demand for euro-zone debt has dropped substantially in the past 12 months, as the scale of financial problems in weaker economies became more apparent. 

Cumulative net inflows into euro-zone debt fell to only €47.7 billion in the year through January, down from €306.6 billion in the previous 12 months. 

However, demand for euro-zone equities rose in January, with net inflows reaching €14 billion, compared with €5.2 billion in December.
