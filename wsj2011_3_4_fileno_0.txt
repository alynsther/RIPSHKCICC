Last weekend Massachusetts Republican Scott Brown began a book tour to promote his memoir, "Against All Odds," which in part details his come-from-behind victory in last year's special election for the late Ted Kennedy's U.S. Senate seat. On Monday, and not coincidentally, Democratic Gov. Deval Patrick divulged the names of several fellow Democrats who've spoken to him about challenging Mr. Brown in 2012.

The most prominent of the bunch is Alan Khazei, who finished third in the Democratic primary for Kennedy's seat. Then there's Newton Mayor Setti Warren, who's only been in office for a year. Though a newcomer, he would have plenty of contacts from an earlier stint working as an aide to Sen. John Kerry. Also considering bids are Robert Massie, who ran for lieutenant governor in 1994; and Salem's two-term mayor, Kim Driscoll. Congressmen Michael Capuano and Stephen Lynch have also been floated as potential challengers.

Few Democrats are willing to announce bids so early because the primary could turn into an arms race. Massachusetts has one of the most expensive media markets and highest concentrations of wealthy donors in the nation. Whoever wins the nomination will face a well-positioned Mr. Brown in the general election. Boston Mayor Tom Menino recently said that "there's nobody that can beat him."

Mr. Brown has a $7 million war chest and an approval rating in the mid-50s. His moderate positions on issues like gays in the military and financial reform have helped him maintain support among independents, which were key in his dark horse victory last year and will be critical again in 2012.
