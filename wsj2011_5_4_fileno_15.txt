LONDONâ€”An Algerian court Wednesday sentenced the former head of state oil giant Sonatrach to jail in a corruption case that rocked the key crude and natural-gas exporter. 

The anticorruption ruling comes as the government moves to assuage discontent in the North African nation, which hasn't escaped the sort of unrest roiling the rest of the region. 

State agency Algerie Presse Service said that ex-Sonatrach chief executive  Mohamed Meziane had received a two-year sentence, including one suspended, and a fine equivalent to $7,000, following a probe into alleged contract irregularities that led to his dismissal last year. 

Four other defendants in the case, including former downstream head Abdelhafid Feghouli who had briefly replaced Mr. Meziane, also were sentenced to up to a year in jail each. 

The investigation at Sonatrach triggered the forced departure of most top managers at the company in January 2010 and later of veteran energy minister  Chakib Khelil, who isn't involved in the probe. It led to several months of paralysis at Africa's largest hydrocarbons company and fueled public suspicions of corruption in Algeria's tight-knit power circles. 

Sonatrach has since vowed to turn the page by adopting stringent internal controls, following appointments at the helm of Algeria's energy industry. 

The ruling comes after January riots led the government of  Abdelaziz Bouteflika to speed up employment programs and political reforms, including plans for a constitutional revision announced last month.
