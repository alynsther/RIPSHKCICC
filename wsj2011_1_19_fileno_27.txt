 Wednesday reported a better-than-expected 40% rise in third-quarter net profit thanks to higher sales of premium motorcycles and commercial vehicles. 

Net profit for the October-December period jumped to 6.67 billion rupees from 4.75 billion rupees a year earlier, India's second-biggest motorcycle maker by sales said. That beat the 6.25-billion rupee average of estimates in a Dow Jones Newswires poll of 12 analysts. 

Sales grew 27% to 40.28 billion rupees ($885.7 million) from 31.66 billion rupees. 

The company's shares gained after the results to close about 2% higher at 1,319.85 rupees in a Mumbai market that finished 0.6% lower. 

Growing demand for personal mobility and rising disposable incomes is increasing sales of two-wheelers in India, the world's biggest market after China. Local sales of motorcycles, scooters and mopeds rose 31% in 2010 to 11.28 million units. Motorcycle sales grew 27% to 8.7 million units. 

Bajaj Auto said it sold 598,558 motorcycles in India in the third quarter, up 23% from a year earlier. Exports rose 7% to 239,929 units while sales of commercial vehicles increased 13% to 108,363 vehicles. 

Managing Director  Rajiv Bajaj told the CNBC-TV18 television channel the company will likely perform better in coming quarters as it launches new models, expands its dealer network and due to likely higher sales of three-wheeled vehicles. 

"The volume increase, which has been significant at 20%, yielded an additional 2 billion rupees, while the price increase that we implemented over the last several months yielded more than 1.40 billion rupees [to revenue]" Rajiv Bajaj said. 

He, however, said the company passed on only two-thirds of its raw material price increase to customers. 

Bajaj Auto spent 27.84 billion rupees on raw materials such as rubber, steel and plastics during the quarter, a 33% year-on-year increase. 

The executive said the company will likely maintain its 20% margin on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization next fiscal year as vehicle demand is expected to remain strong. 

Jatin Chawla, a New Delhi-based analyst at brokerage India Infoline Ltd., said it is "commendable" that the company has been able to keep its operating margin steady despite a rise in raw material costs. 

The company plans to introduce a new Discover model in April and one from its Pulsar brand by the end of next year. It is also in the process of setting up 130 new dealerships early next year. 

Rajiv Bajaj said the company expects to sell 400,000 three-wheelers this financial year and half a million units next year.
