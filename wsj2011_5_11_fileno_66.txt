DENVER—Mets first baseman Ike Davis left Tuesday's game with what the team called a strained left calf muscle, casting a pall over their 4-3 victory over the Colorado Rockies. There was no immediate word on the severity of the injury or how long it could keep Davis out, but the fact that he limped off the field after the fourth inning was hardly encouraging.

Davis injured himself with one out in the fourth when he collided with David Wright as the two converged on an infield pop-up in front of the mound. After a visit from trainer Ray Ramirez, Davis got up and finished the inning at first base. But he did not return for the fifth.

Davis drove in one run with a first-inning single. Mike Pelfrey added a two-run double while limiting Colorado to three runs—all on solo home runs—in 6 2/3 innings.
