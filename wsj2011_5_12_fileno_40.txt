MUMBAI --Hindusthan National Glass & Industries has said it will buy the assets of Germany's ailing glass-container maker Agenda Glas AG for about 50 million euros ($71 million). 

Hindusthan National said it signed a pact with Germany's Insolvency Administrator to buy the assets of Agenda Glas that went into bankruptcy in February. 

The Indian company expects to invest 50 million euros over a one-year period to buy the German company through its unit, HNG Global GmbH. 

Agenda Glas has a production capacity of 320 tons a day, the company added.
