The knockout rounds for rugby union's Heineken Cup will take shape this weekend as the four remaining playoff spots are decided in the final round of group games.

Northampton, Toulouse, Leinster and Toulon are already in the knockout stages as pool winners, but two more pools and the two top runners-up have yet to be confirmed.

Pool Two will be decided on Friday when Leinster visits Racing Métro and Saracens hosts Clermont Auvergne. Clermont is available at 2/1 to win with Sportingbet and Bodog—a fantastic price given that Saracens has nothing to play for. The French team is third in the pool but could scrape into the quarterfinals. Even if it misses a last-eight berth, Clermont will want to win to be certain of at least a Challenge Cup place. 

By contrast, Saracens has lost both previous European matches at its Vicarage Road ground this season and lost to the same opponents by 15 points in France. With Owen Farrell, the 19-year-old, likely to start at flyhalf here, Saracens' inexperience could prove costly.

It's difficult to see Leinster, already guaranteed top spot in this group, losing to Racing Métro. The Irish side has won four of its five Cup games, with an additional two bonus-point wins, while the French team failed to defeat Saracens at home. However, Racing Métro are no pushovers. After 16 games, the team from Paris sits atop the competitive French Top 14 league, and should be able to get within five points of Leinster here. Back the home team at a general 10/11 on the handicap.
