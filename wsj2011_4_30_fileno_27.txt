Ditmas Park's most popular restaurant is emblematic of the neighborhood: It's inexpensive and unpretentious, often drawing young professionals and families from Manhattan or brownstone Brooklyn.



Gary and Allison Jonas, who founded The Farm on Adderley in 2006, fell in love with Ditmas Park's grand Victorian houses and shifting cultural landscape. "You feel like you're in the middle of Ohio," Mr. Jonas said. "There's houses and there's lawns and there's more space. You just don't feel like you're in New York."

Brunch dishes are simple, fresh and well prepared. Most ingredients come from farms in New York and Pennsylvania. Standout dishes include the Farmer's Breakfast (scrambled eggs over Swiss chard) and a croque sandwich with house-cured ham and melted Gruy√®re cheese. Popular sides include the toast with goat butter and maple sugar, and the chocolate brioche with sea salt and butter. The brioche is exceptional: sweet and fluffy.

During the warmer months, customers flock to a large outdoor patio with a mural covering one wall.

A 30-to-45-minute wait is common for weekend brunch. But patrons can wile away the time a few doors down at Sycamore, a bar also owned by the Jonases, which doubles as a flower shop.

 The Farm on Adderley, 1108 Cortelyou Rd. (between Stratford and Westminster roads), serves brunch on Saturdays and Sundays, 10:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., 718-287-3101
