Mortgage rates rose in the latest week, leaving the average rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages closer to 5%, according to a weekly survey by Freddie Mac. 

"Mortgage rates followed bond yields a little higher this week amid positive data reports from the Conference Board that suggest the economy is strengthening," said Freddie Chief Economist  Frank Nothaft. 

Rates had slumped for months, setting repeated all-time lows in the process, as yields on Treasurys slid amid economic uncertainty. But those yields have risen recently, pulling rates higher. Mortgage rates generally track the yields, which move inversely to Treasury prices. 

The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 4.8% for the week ended Thursday, up slightly from the prior week's 4.74% average but down from 4.98% a year ago. Rates on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages were 4.09%, up from 4.05% in the previous week but down from 4.39% a year earlier. 

Five-year Treasury-indexed hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages averaged 3.70%, up from the prior week's 3.69% but down from 4.25% a year earlier. One-year Treasury-indexed ARMs were 3.26%, up from 3.25% in the prior week but down from 4.29% a year earlier. 

To obtain the rates, borrowers had to pay an average of 0.6 point on the one-year adjustable-rate mortgages; the others required an average 0.7 point. A point is 1% of the mortgage amount, charged as prepaid interest.
