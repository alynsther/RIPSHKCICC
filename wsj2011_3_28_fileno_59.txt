Roebling Tea Room is the sort of place a dressy hipster might hit with the corduroy jacket and the good  Chuck Taylors on date night. It's certainly not unusual to see a mangy pair cooing over doggerel on the comfy sofas by candlelight. We set out to answer a different question, though: What's for lunch? 

The answer, as it turns out, is breakfast. Eggs, pancakes, and other traditional comforts abound, along with a few more conventional choices such as the steak tartar ($11) and the burger ($14). Settle on the beets and eggs ($10)—two perfectly cooked over-easy eggs with creamy goat cheese, kale and beets—and add the pumpernickel toast ($2.50). 

Naturally, a varied selection of teas (about $2.50) is available. The Mademoiselle Grey and the chocolaty Moon Pie are fine choices. With its atmosphere and tasty tea roster, it's no wonder the Tea Room had to institute a weekend laptop ban to prevent "lunches" from stretching into entire afternoons.
