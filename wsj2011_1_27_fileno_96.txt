Betting that there's still something left in his oversized tank, the Yankees have signed 2005 Cy Young winner Bartolo Colon to a minor league contract, a baseball source confirmed. 

Mr. Colon, 37, hasn't pitched in the majors since July 2009 with the White Sox, and has been atrocious since his Cy Young season, struggling with arm and shoulder injuries and weight issues.

But the pitcher put up a sub-2.00 ERA playing for Yankee coach Tony Pena in the Dominican Republic this winter, and worked out this past week for Yankee brass in Tampa. He impressed, and the team offered a $900,000 minor league deal and a spring training invitation, with performance incentives that could raise the payout. Mr. Colon has a clause that would allow him to leave the organization at the start of the season if he does not make the major league club.

Mr. Colon could work as either a starter or a reliever, depending on the team's other needs and how his stuff plays in either role. He is expected to enter spring training on a starter's program, providing another option to compete with journeyman Sergio Mitre for the last spot in the rotation.

With the Yankees missing out on Cliff Lee in free agency this winter, the back end of the Yankee rotation is weakâ€” Mr. Colon was once traded for Mr. Lee, but that's where the comparisons end at this point in their careers. 

If Mr. Colon doesn't win a spot in the rotation, and there's no room for him in the stacked Yankee bullpen, he'll likely leave and look for a job elsewhere.

For the Yankees, Mr. Colon's deal is a low risk, potentially high reward acquisition if Mr. Colon can beat the odds and show that he has bounced back at last. He once threw high-90s heat, but his average fastball velocity in his last stint, in Chicago, was just over 89 mph. 

Mr. Colon put up 20-win seasons in 2002 and 2005. He has a 153-103 record and a 4.10 career ERA in stints with Cleveland, Anaheim, Boston, the Montreal Expos, and the Chicago White Sox.
