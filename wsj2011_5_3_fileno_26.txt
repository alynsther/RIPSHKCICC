BANGKOKâ€”Thailand's Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva said Tuesday he has not yet submitted a royal decree seeking to dissolve parliament to the Thai king. 

House Speaker Chai Chidchob told reporters earlier Tuesday that the premiere had submitted the decree, which will allow house resolution to become effective after being granted a royal endorsement. 

"There must be some sort of misunderstanding," Mr. Abhisit said, declining to provide a specific time frame of when he plans to submit the decree. 

Mr. Abhisit has said recently that he plans to dissolve the House of Representatives by Friday and call what he described as a landmark election for the Southeast Asian country, which has been plagued by deep and sometimes deadly political divisions.
