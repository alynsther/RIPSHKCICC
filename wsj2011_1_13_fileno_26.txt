LONDON—The U.K. government's "ambitious" program to pare back the budget deficit means the country should maintain its triple-A credit rating despite slower than expected economic growth forecasts, Moody's Investors Service Inc. said Thursday. 

The ratings agency said the government's front-loaded package of spending cuts and tax rises would allow the U.K.'s gross debt to gross domestic product ratio stabilize at around 90% in 2013. This would allow debt affordability to remain at a level consistent with its Aaa rating, Moody's said. 

Thursday's report is the first time Moody's has commented on the U.K.'s creditworthiness since Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne's October spending review, which laid out £81 billion ($127.72 billion) in expenditure cuts by 2015. 

Moody's said it expects the U.K.'s private sector to compensate for the contraction in government spending, adding that real GDP growth will remain above 2% through to the middle of the decade. However, the ratings agency cautioned that the government's austerity program remained a "political challenge." 

"The government's political commitment to fiscal consolidation is currently quite strong, but is likely to be tested in the coming years as the electorate digests likely changes to the quantity and quality of public service provision," it said. 

Moody's said moderately higher inflation would have a mixed impact on the U.K.'s fiscal outlook, but said on balance, it is probably more positive than negative due to the importance of nominal GDP growth to a country's debt dynamics. 

Inflation has been above the Bank of England's 2.0% target in 41 out of the past 50 months, and is expected to stay high over the coming year. 

Moody's said due to the importance of inflation-linked gilts in the U.K.'s debt stock—they account for 20.4% of the total gilt and treasury bill portfolio—higher inflation will result in higher interest costs.
