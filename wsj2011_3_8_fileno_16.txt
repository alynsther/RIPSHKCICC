Decorated with vintage baby dolls, a blown-up photo of a pregnancy test, a portrait of Meryl Streep and wallpaper covered in propellersâ€”the eye-catching design of Pol Theis's Flatiron co-op, on the market for $1.95 million, is extremely eclectic. Just don't call it weird.



"It's a little hard to understand right away," said the interior designer of his two-bedroom loft, which has been featured in architectural and design magazines. When people come inside the home, he said, they find it "maybe strange but not weird."

Mr. Theis, who first moved to Manhattan from Paris in 2001, was in the market for a loft space. He searched for about a year before coming across the corner unit at 260 Fifth Ave., which won him over with its oversized windows and prewar characteristics. He bought the home in 2004 for $1.36 million, according to property records.

Mr. Theis gave the place a new design and layout with generous open spaces and pocket doors. The kitchen was overhauled and the cement floors were replaced with oak, which were stained chocolate brown. The walls were treated with shades such as rust, charcoal and gray. Only the full bathroom, outlined in green marble, remained largely unchanged.

Mr. Theis then added his signature furnishings, such as a stop sign he bought from a flea market that hangs at the entrance to the master bedroom. The large "F" in the guest bedroom comes from the Firestone Tire logo. There are also a number of sculptures that Mr. Theis created throughout the home. 

His term for the space: "industrial chic."

Mr. Theis, who founded a boutique interior-design firm, said he has decided to part ways with the apartment because he's purchased a larger loft in the Garment District. He initially put the 1,700-square-foot property on the market in January for $2.2 million, but the price was reduced a month later. 

Mr. Theis said a price for the furniture is negotiable. As for the other funky furnishings, those aren't included.
