The Social Security Administration last month stopped mailing out annual estimates of benefits to future Social Security recipients, as part of its cost-cutting measures.

Statements had been sent three months prior to the birthday of workers age 25 and older who had paid a certain minimum amount in Social Security taxes. That means the change affects individuals with birthdays starting in July.

To get future benefits information, individuals will now have to go the Social Security Administration's website. (Go to socialsecurity.gov/estimator and click on "Estimate Your Retirement Benefits.")

  Mark Lassiter, a Social Security Administration spokesman, says the online tool is more accurate than the paper statements were because it allows you to plug in different variables that could change your monthly benefit. You can plug in the age (between 62 and 70) you plan to begin receiving benefits as well as future income that's different from your current earnings.

To get information on earnings history or disability and survivor benefits, however, you'll have to call the agency at 1-800-772-1213.

The agency estimates it will save $60 million annually with the online initiative. Mr. Lassiter says the agency plans to resume mailing paper statements to people age 60 and over within 12 months or so.
