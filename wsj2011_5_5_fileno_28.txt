NEW DELHI --India's state-run Oil & Natural Gas Corp. may launch a follow-on public offering on July 5, a senior company executive said Thursday.

"The follow-on public offering is being managed by the government," said the executive, who didn't wish to be named. "They are considering various schedules and July 5 is one of the dates being considered." 

India's government, which owns 74.14% of the oil and gas explorer, plans to sell a 5% stake in the company to raise funds for social welfare and infrastructure projects. 

The government, earlier, had considered launching ONGC's share sale in January but then deferred it to April as the plan hit a roadblock with the capital markets regulator because of a shortfall in the number of independent, or non-executive, directors on its board.

"The appointment of the independent board members is under consideration," the ONGC executive said.
