On Selection Sunday, the fourth-seeded Wisconsin Badgers may have got a kiss of death: a long-distance flight to begin the NCAA tournament.

Recent high seeds (#1-4) that traveled long distances for their first two tournament games.

Note: minimum one time zone between campus and site

One of the time-honored maxims of the tournament is to be wary of high seeds that have to travel across the map. The disadvantage of making a long trip across multiple time zones probably isn't as severe as fans assume it is—it didn't prevent Purdue from reaching last season's Sweet 16 despite opening in distant Spokane, Wash.—but the numbers say it is indeed harder. Since the tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985, teams seeded one through four have reached the Sweet 16 62% of the time. But for ones playing at least 1,000 miles from campus, the success rate drops to 54%. (Madison, Wis., is about 1,400 miles from Tucson, the site of the Badgers' first game.)

Some of the tournament's most memorable early-round upsets occurred to teams that were a long way from home. In 1990, defending national-champion Michigan—playing in Long Beach, Calif.—got blown out, 149-115, by Loyola Marymount, a Los Angeles school. In 1999, 14th-seeded Weber State shocked third-seeded North Carolina in Seattle.

While Wisconsin fans have reason to start panicking, people in North Carolina can basically book their travel to the Sweet 16 now. Both Duke and North Carolina are playing this weekend in Charlotte, N.C.—about 120 miles from their respective campuses. Since 1985, 67 teams seeded one through four have played their opening round games less than 150 miles from home. A whopping 80.6% advanced to the Sweet 16.
