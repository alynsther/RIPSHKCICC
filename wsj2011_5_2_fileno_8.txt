LOS ANGELESâ€”The criminal trial of Conrad Murray, the physician charged with involuntary manslaughter in the death of pop icon Michael Jackson, has been postponed until early September.

At a Monday state court hearing here, Judge Michael Pastor delayed the trial, which had been scheduled to begin later this month, to give attorneys more time to prepare. 

Dr. Murray has pleaded not guilty. Mr. Jackson died in June 2009 from an overdose of various drugs, including the anesthetic propofol. 

Judge Pastor said that a pool of about 170 potential jurors would be dismissed and a new pool would be called, with jury selection to begin Sept 8. The trial is expected to last several weeks.
