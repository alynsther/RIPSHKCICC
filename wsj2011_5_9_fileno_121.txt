 Wartime Virginia A number of museums and historical groups are commemorating this year's 150th anniversary of the start of the Civil War. Among the best exhibits: "An American Turning Point: The Civil War in Virginia." Assembled by the Virginia Historical Society in Richmond, the show features more than 200 objects (among them: Gen. Stonewall Jackson's pocket watch), interactive technology (can you text faster than a telegraph operator from the 1860s?) and 17 audio-visual programs (including an all-too-vivid battle scene). Perhaps most important, the exhibit, according to the historical society, goes beyond military campaigns to highlight the "personal experiences of the free and enslaved men, women and children of wartime Virginia." The exhibit runs through Dec. 30.

 Solo Travel We regularly get emails that note (politely, for the most part) that "not all of your readers are couples." With that in mind, and with summer travel on the horizon, check out Road Scholar Connection. This program is part of Road Scholar (formerly Elderhostel), a longtime leader in educational travel. Each year, about 20% of the organization's participants are traveling solo. Road Scholar Connection is a social-networking tool that enables such individuals to link up with other travelers. At its most basic, the service can help users find a roommate for a particular trip. But the program also connects solo travelers with others who share the same interests, whether it's food and wine, trains or natural history. And that's worth emailing about.
