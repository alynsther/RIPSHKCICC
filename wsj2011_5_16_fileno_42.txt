 for 360 million Australian dollars (US$379.9 million). 

The deal will deliver Gloucester more thermal and coking-coal mines and give it access to new port capacity. Australia, the world's largest exporter of coal, is experiencing booming demand due to a voracious appetite for energy from China and India. Demand from Japan is expected to rise in the medium-term as a result of lower usage of nuclear power following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident. 

Gloucester Coal will raise A$230 million through an equity issue at A$9.00 a share to fund the deal that also includes the acquisition of prospective coking and thermal coal developer Monash Group. 

Noble, a Hong Kong-based commodities trader that holds a 65% stake in Gloucester, said it will sell Donaldson for the allotment of 36.9 million new Gloucester shares at an issue price of A$9.75. The enterprise value of the Donaldson sale is A$585 million including debt and the sale is also conditional on Gloucester raising as much as A$500 million in debt finance. 

Gloucester expects its market capitalization to rise above A$2 billion after the acquisitions from A$1.39 billion prior. 

Gloucester shares are on trading halt pending the capital raising. They last traded at A$9.90.
