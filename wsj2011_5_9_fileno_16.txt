LONDONâ€”The widespread halt in home foreclosures will result in the U.S. economic recovery taking longer than was anticipated just several months ago,  HSBC Holdings PLC's Chief Financial Officer  Iain Mackay said Monday.

The moratorium on foreclosures imposed by HSBC and other U.S. banks, following regulators' concerns over irregularities, is "having a direct downward pressure on property prices," Mr. Mackay said. Stalling the flow of foreclosed homes coming onto the market delays recovery of prices, and adds to buyer uncertainty.

In its quarterly results Monday, the bank reported a $400 million impairment charge in its U.S operations which reflects "a change to underlying assumptions" about the housing market and economy, he said.

"We always expected it to be a very slow recovery; we expect it to be slower now," Mr. Mackay said.

His comments come after U.S data show that home values in the first quarter posted their largest decline since late 2008. 

The performance of HSBC's U.S. division is often seen as bellwether for the U.S. housing market. The London-based bank was among the first to call the U.S. subprime meltdown in early 2007. It has since racked up $40 billion in charges in it U.S. consumer-finance business, the former Household International Inc., most of which is now being wound down or sold.

Mr. Mackay also said Monday that the euro-zone debt situation "is still evolving." 

"Sensible actions have been taken [by European ministers] and need to be allowed to work through the system," he said.
