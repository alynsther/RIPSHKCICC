Silicon Valley, the natural habitat of the T-shirt-wearing techie, isn't known as a fashion hub. A recent study, however, suggests that at least some South Bay residents invest in their threads. Pinpoint Demographics, a Maine research firm, found that four Silicon Valley cities—Los Gatos, Los Altos, Saratoga and Santa Clara—were among the top 10 in clothing spending per capita in the U.S. And leading the pack is the wealthy East Bay town of Danville. Pinpoint notes that the cities on the list are among the richest in the country. Danville's median household income is about $128,000, while Saratoga's is $140,000. The study is based on Pinpoint's research and data from the U.S. Census County Business Patterns program.
