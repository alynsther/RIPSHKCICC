For Real Madrid, there was a time when the European Cup was part of the furniture.

It has won Europe's elite club tournament a record nine times and was the first ever winner back in 1956, when the legendary Alfredo di Stéfano inspired a 4-3 triumph over Stade Reims in Paris.

But these days, the European Cup is no longer Madrid's birthright. The team hasn't made it past the first knockout round for six straight years.

As Madrid prepares to host Olympique Lyon on Wednesday, however, that dismal sequence is finally nearing an end. Following a 1-1 draw in the first leg of this Champions League round-of-16 game, Madrid enters the decisive second leg with homefield advantage, holding an edge in the tiebreaker thanks to its away goal, and as a heavy favorite with oddsmakers.

José Mourinho's team is no better than 1/5 with William Hill to qualify, while Lyon is 24/5 on Betdaq despite having eliminated Madrid last season.

Lyon has been Madrid's bogey team in recent years. The teams have played seven Champions League games in the past decade, and Madrid has lost every time.

Under Mourinho, expect Madrid to put the record straight here. In 21 home games since taking charge last summer, Mourinho has an incredible 100% win rate and Madrid is yet to concede a goal in three Champions League home games this season.

Madrid can be backed at 5/4 with Blue Square or 888sport to win to nil.
