PARIS—Christian Dior launched a dismissal procedure against its star designer  John Galliano as the iconic French fashion house moves to distance itself from anti-Semitic statements he allegedly made and that French police are investigating.

In a statement emailed Tuesday, Dior said that it had launched the procedure to fire Mr. Galliano because of the "odious behavior and comments" displayed by the British designer in a video that circulated widely on the Internet Monday. 

"I condemn with the greatest firmness the comments made by John Galliano, in total contradiction with the essential values which have always been defended by Christian Dior," said  Sidney Toledano, Dior chief executive, in the statement, 

Dior had suspended Mr. Galliano last Friday after a late-night argument in a bar during which the designer allegedly made anti-Semitic and racist slurs against two bar patrons. The suspension was in place pending the results of a police investigation into the incident. It is unclear whether the video posted Monday is from the same night or from another moment.

Dior is part of the luxury goods empire of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton boss  Bernard Arnault.
