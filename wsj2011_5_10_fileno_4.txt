Despite a solid career as governor of Utah and (until last week) America's ambassador to China, Jon Huntsman is one of the least-known candidates likely to run for the Republican presidential nomination. So he is trying to make up for his name ID deficit with a series of quick political moves. Mr. Huntsman has opened a political action committee, hired a former strategist and last weekend made carefully selected appearances at mega-churches in South Carolina, an early GOP primary state.

Mr. Huntsman is also trying to connect with younger voters. "My initial passion in life was to be a rock 'n' roll musician," he said in a commencement address at the University of South Carolina. "In my late teens you wouldn't have recognized me. My hair was Rod Stewart shaggy. I wouldn't wear anything but super skinny jeans. I ended up leaving high school a bit short of graduation to play with a band called Wizard. I thought it was my ticket to fame."

He then tried to bring his music knowledge closer to today by identifying one of his favorite musicians as Ben Foldsâ€”and quoting lyrics from his song "The Luckiest."

Mr. Huntsman is clearly not vying for a spot in the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame, but he wants to show he is not just another stiff politician. His staff widely circulated his speech through social media and actively sought comments on it through Twitter messages.

The youth vote has never been a major factor in GOP primaries, but Mr. Huntsman's cultural outreach could also appeal to millions of baby boomers who have harbored their own dreams of a rock n' roll experience. If nothing else, Mr. Huntsman will have an easy way to bond with potential Republican endorsers like New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who is an unapologetic "mega Bruce Springsteen fan."
