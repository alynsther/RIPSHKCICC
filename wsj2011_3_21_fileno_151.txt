 INHERITANCE NUMBERS Yes, you might get an inheritance—but don't count on it changing your life. A recent report from the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College estimates that baby boomers will inherit as much as $8 trillion over their lifetimes. But only about two-thirds of households are likely to receive any money, and the median inheritance is estimated at $64,000. The study warns: "Even parents who have a strong desire to leave a bequest may be forced to revise their plans based on fluctuations in the value of their assets…or they may exhaust their wealth as a result of medical and, especially, long-term-care costs."
