European stock markets traded mildly higher Friday amid lower volumes with London trading closed for the British royal wedding, finishing off a month of solid gains.

  Volvo scored gains and solar companies rose across the board on news of a deal in the sector, but  Daimler fell on earnings disappointment. 

The Stoxx Europe 600 index rose 0.3% to end at 283.78 on the last trading day of the month, giving it a 2.9% gain for April. It has advanced for four the past five months.

Near the end of Europe's trading day, the Dow industrials was up 65 points, or 0.5%, to 12828, looking to wrap up its best month of the year. The measure has climbed for five straight months and is up 4.1% for April.

  Heino Ruland, strategist at Ruland Research, said London's absence thinned out volume for Europe. "London players are pretty much overweight German equities, so they are a dominant force in our market."

London, which ended the month up 2.7%, will also be closed on Monday for a bank holiday. 

Volvo rose 2.3%. Earlier this week, the company reported robust results and lifted its outlook for European and North America on a continuing demand recovery. 

But auto maker Daimler felll 1.7% after net income failed to meet expectations for a second consecutive quarter.

 which came out with numbers that were a lot higher than analysts were expecting," Mr. Ruland said. Volkswagen rose 1.5%. 

Frankfurt's DAX 30 index shook off early losses to rise 0.5% to 7514.46, its highest close since January 2008 and a 6.7% gain for April. Friday's advance was supported by  Deutsche Bank, whose shares gained 0.7%. The investment bank continued to gain a day after reporting upbeat results. 

In Paris, the CAC 40 index was little changed at 4106.92 but gained 3% for the month, its fourth monthly gain in the past five.
