Better broke in Amsterdam than a millionaire in Paris—or so warbled Johnny Jordaan, a Dutch folk singer who was a national icon in the 1950s. Whether or not you agree is irrelevant; the point is that Amsterdam natives are a highly opinionated bunch. And that fits this slightly peculiar city just fine. 



Amsterdam lacks the size of London and the grandeur of Paris. It doesn't tower like New York or buzz like Rome. Its glory days, when the city was the center of global trade, arts and science, are 300 years gone. Yet every year, millions come to the Low Country for a piece of Amsterdam's special vibe, which might best be summed up as a spirit of contented contradiction. 

Amsterdam is cosmopolitan but relaxed, a big city that feels like a small town, criss-crossed by its famously charming canals, the narrow streets commonly navigated by bike. It's a contemporary design hotbed that can seem conventional at a glance. The seedy red-light district is a short stroll from the mighty Royal Palace at Dam Square. (One of its alleys leads to upscale eatery Blauw aan de Wal.) The infamous coffee shops that peddle cannabis are scattered through the city's centuries-old historic center. 

While all the elements of classic Amsterdam are alive and well, this town is far from frozen in time—its neighborhoods continue to evolve in intriguing ways. Over the past couple of decades, the Jordaan district has gone from a ragged working-class area to a pedestrian heaven packed with designer shops, coffee houses and bars. The Eastern Docklands, abandoned by shipping companies in the '70s, is now the go-to locale for fans of contemporary architecture. Even the red-light district is undergoing a gradual transformation, as the city council now discourages brothels and encourages designers and artists to set up shop.
