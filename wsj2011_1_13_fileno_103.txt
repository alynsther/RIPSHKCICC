San Francisco's tourism industry recovered last year as visitors returned in greater numbers to the City by the Bay, but hoteliers and restaurant operators say there is still a ways to go before business feels robust again.

In 2010, hotel occupancy rates rebounded to pre-recession levels citywide, and restaurants—especially in tourist locales such as Fisherman's Wharf and North Beach—reported increased traffic. The gains bode well for 2011, tourism officials and business owners say. 

Yet revenue at many businesses remained below pre-recession peaks, as room rates stayed down and diners avoided splurging on reserve wines and top-shelf liquor.

"They say when there are good times, people drink," says Andre Astabie, general manager of Calzone's restaurant in North Beach. "When there are bad times, people drink more. But people aren't drinking as much as they used to—not here, anyways."

Still, Mr. Astabie will take last year over 2009, when business was flat after growing as much as 10% a year in the previous decade. Revenue climbed 5% in 2010 compared with 2009, the manager says, largely because of increased business from European travelers.

What businesses like Mr. Astabie's experience has implications for San Francisco, since the tourism industry is the city's biggest by tax revenue. In 2009, the latest year for which data are available, 15.4 million people visited the city, spending $7.8 billion and generating $426 million in tax revenue, according to the San Francisco Travel Association, the city's main visitors bureau. Those figures were significantly below those of 2008. Data for 2010 won't be available until later this year, but  Leonard Hoops of the San Francisco Travel Association predicts they will show an increase over 2009.

"Looking backward at 2010, we didn't go any deeper into the trough," says Mr. Hoops, an executive vice president at the association. "We're cautiously optimistic that we're starting to climb out of the trough."

  Ted Egan, the city's chief economist, agrees with that assessment. The strength of the city's tourism industry generally mirrors that of the national economy, which is on the upswing. Indirect indicators, such as the growth of sales-tax revenue and increased arrivals at San Francisco Airport (up 5.3% from January to November 2010 compared with a year earlier), also suggest growth in tourism.

Mr. Egan says the clearest bellwether is the hotel industry, which accounts for around half of the city's tourism-related tax revenue. Industry tracker Colliers PKF Consulting, which has data through October, projects that the 2010 occupancy rate for San Francisco hotels will be 75.4%, up from 71.2% in 2009 and above the 2008 peak of 75.1%.

But room rates are still down, in part because hotels slashed prices to boost occupancy. The average daily rate for a room in 2010 is projected to finish at $139.22, which is above the 2009 rate of $136.39 but far below the 2008 peak of $159.80.

The good news for hotels: The average daily rate is expected to jump to $148.75 this year and match pre-recession levels in 2012, according to PKF predictions. "We're going to have high occupancies and room rates are going to come back strongly," says  Thomas Callahan, head of PKF's West Coast practice. 

That's a relief to  Matthew Martinucci, director of sales and marketing at the Parc 55 hotel near Union Square. He says after an "unsettling" 2009, his hotel saw real growth in the second half of last year. "It was great because we could finally have some confidence about where things were headed," he says. "We all felt we had been through a lot at that point."

Things are also looking better at the Argonaut Hotel on Fisherman's Wharf, where a spokeswoman says the occupancy rate ticked up from 82% in 2009 to 87% last year. The boost has trickled down to the seafood restaurants in the area, some of the eateries said.

Tourists are back at the Franciscan Crab Restaurant, where general manager  Craig Woods says business in 2010 was up 20% from a year earlier, after being down 10% in 2009. He attributes part of the success to a three-course prix-fixe dinner special, which goes for either $19.95 or $29.95, which was introduced in early 2009 to lure cost-conscious customers. 

Down the street at Scoma's Restaurant, the eatery posted flat numbers last year after being down 5% in 2009. The restaurant also introduced a prix-fixe menu, for $39.95, to entice diners during the economic slump.

"People are looking for values," says  Mariann Costello, the restaurant's vice president. She adds that the restaurant, which operates on a July-to-June fiscal year, is doing better this year. "If our first quarter is an indication, then things might be starting to turn around," she says.
