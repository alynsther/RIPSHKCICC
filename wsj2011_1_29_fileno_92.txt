 Q: I love my Bose headphones, but I hate that everyone else on the plane wears them, too. Are there other noise-canceling phones you like? 

 A: I understand. You're one of those über-miling road warriors, but you don't want to look like one, right? Same rolly luggage, same neck pillow, same noise-canceling headphones. They must issue this stuff once you hit Elite Gold status. Personally, I like the majority of Bose's headphones—they set the standard—but hey, I like to help. Here are three that will set you apart from hoi polloi.

Compared with most active noise-canceling headsets (that's where the headphone produces a frequency to "cancel" the ambient noise around you), these are a bargain without sounding like one—thumpy bass and clear, high trebles. I admire the simple, inconspicuous look. They're distinct in their discreetness. $120, audio-technica.com 

These are passive noise-canceling headphones; they block out noise with sound-absorbing material rather than creating frequencies. They come with four types of removable ear sleeves, but I prefer the foam variety as they block out sound almost as well as those ear plugs they hand you on a red eye. $300, shure.com.

I never really thought headphone wires got in the way, but after using the Bluetooth wireless, active noise-cancelling MM 550, I now find them as annoying as people who do aisle-yoga in your face area. But there is a price to pay for being untethered: These sound good, just not as brilliant as a wired headset. (You can plug a cord into these if you want wired sound or if the batteries run out.) But after you get used to walking around the cabin without having to remove your cans, you'll forgive the sound and never want to go back. $500, sennheiser.com.
