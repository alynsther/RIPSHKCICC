MUMBAIâ€”Indian shares fell for the fifth straight session Monday, pulling the benchmark index to a six-week low on selling in Reliance Industries and banking stocks. 

The Bombay Stock Exchange's 30-share Sensitive Index fell 467.69 points, or 2.4%, to close at 19224.12 after moving between 19158.43 and 19720.43. The Sensex last closed below this level on Nov. 26. On the National Stock Exchange, the 50-stock S&P CNX Nifty fell 141.75 points, or 2.4%, to end at 5762.85. 

Trading volume on the BSE rose marginally to 35.12 billion rupees ($772.9 million) from Friday's 35.04 billion rupees. Gainers lagged decliners 648 to 2,233, while 122 stocks were unchanged. 

Traders and investors continued to worry that India's central bank would raise policy rates sooner than anticipated to fight rising food inflation. Investors suspect that the Reserve Bank of India may act before its scheduled monetary policy review on Jan. 25, after government data Thursday showed that food inflation jumped to 18.32% year-on-year in the week ended Dec. 25 from 14.44% in the previous week. 

"It was a continuation of Friday's bearish sentiment, and the selling is being led by India-focussed exchange traded funds and foreign institutions," said  Jagdish Malkani, country head at investment bank TAIB Capital. 

There could be a slight bounce in the coming sessions on bargain-buying, but nervous investors are likely to use any increases to book profits, he added. 

Among the 30 Sensex constituents, 28 finished lower Monday. 

Reliance Industries, India's largest company by market capitalization, led declines amid heavy selling by foreign investors in large-cap stocks. It ended down 3.2% at 1,031.05 rupees. 

Banking stocks extended falls on concerns that high interest rates would eat into interest margins and hurt credit demand. Falls were led by  HDFC Bank as investors dumped shares fearing the bank's competitive advantage, in the form of a large low-cost deposit base, would be eroded in a rising deposit rate scenario. 

"Also, HDFC Bank offers lower deposit rates than its competitors, thus the lender is not expected to attract much inflows; while others are aggressively attracting high-cost deposits," said an analyst with a local brokerage who declined to be identified. 

HDFC Bank fell 5.0% to 2,154.9 rupees. ICICI Bank closed 3.2% lower at 1,014.3 rupees while State Bank of India declined 2 % to 2,547.8 rupees. 

Capital goods also saw sharp falls on concerns that high interest costs would eat into profitability. 

Bharat Heavy Electricals fell 4.8% to 2,181.5 rupees while Larsen & Toubro closed 3.5% lower at 1,782.45 rupees.

Autos slipped for the fourth day amid increased raw material costs and rising fuel prices. Bajaj Auto lost 4.1% to 1,263.35 rupees while Hero Honda Motors declined 3.7% to 1,804.6 rupees. 

  Infosys Technologies and Bharti Airtel were the only two Sensex constituents to end higher. Infosys gained 0.9% to end at 3,396.65 rupees while Bharti Airtel closed 0.04% higher at 338.85 rupees. 

  Patni Computer Systems gained 0.8% to 463.85 rupees after a consortium of  iGate Corp. and U.S. private-equity firm Apax Partners agreed to buy a 63% stake in the Indian outsourcing firm Patni from General Atlantic LLC and three Patni founders in a deal that could be worth as much as $1.22 billion. 

As part of the agreement, iGate will offer 503.5 rupees a share for the 45.6% stake held by the founders and the 17.4% held by General Atlantic worth a combined $921 million. That would trigger an open offer for 20% more in the company under Indian regulations.
