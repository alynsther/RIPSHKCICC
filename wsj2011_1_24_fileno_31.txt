 PLC's 3.9 billion Australia dollar ($3.8 billion) takeover of  Riversdale Mining Ltd. received a boost Monday when the last holdout on the coking coal miner's board recommended the deal along with its other directors.

  NK Misra, a Tata Steel Ltd. appointee to Riversdale's board thanks to the Indian company's 24.2% stake in the miner, backed Rio's offer signalling that the steel producer may not seek to block Rio's buyout with its own bid to take control of the miner, according to a statement.

Riversdale said NK Misra's "recommendation is given in his capacity as a director of Riversdale and does not reflect Tata Steel's position."

The company said that no superior proposal had been received "and the company is not aware of any party having an intention to make such a proposal."

Bloomberg News reported Saturday that International Coal Ventures, a consortium of Indian miners and steelmakers not including Tata, will discuss a rival bid for the company Thursday.
