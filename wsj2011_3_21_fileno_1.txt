OTTAWAâ€”A Canadian parliamentary committee recommended Monday that the government be found in contempt of Parliament for not fully disclosing the cost of anticrime legislation, paving the way for a rebuke that could trigger a third national election in five years. 

In a report filed Monday, the committee upheld a recent finding of breach of parliamentary privilege against the government by the Speaker of the House of Commons, the elected lower house of Parliament. Parliamentary procedure requires a minimum notice of 48 hours to vote on the report. That means the earliest it will go for a vote in the House is Wednesday.

A government spokesman wasn't immediately available to comment on the report. 

If the full Parliament approves the report, it would be the first time in Canadian history that a government has been found in contempt of Parliament. Prime Minister Stephen Harper's Conservative, minority government doesn't have a majority in Parliament, and opposition leaders have the votes to push approval in Parliament. 

Such a rebuke would strengthen the opposition's hand as it weighs whether to call a vote of no confidence, triggering new elections. The opposition has another opportunity to bring down the government after Mr. Harper's finance minister presents the budget on Tuesday. Mr. Harper must garner support from at least one of Canada's major opposition parties. If it fails on such a key spending measure, it would be forced to call new elections.
