A multimillionaire named Jack Davis has roiled the political waters of upstate New York for years by spending wads of his own money in U.S. House races. Having run as a Democrat and then an independent, he has now created his own tea party ballot line in a special election on May 24 for a Buffalo-area House race. His populist message and deceptive ballot line threatens to cost the GOP control of a seat they routinely carry in state-wide races. Recent polls have him taking 23% of the vote, about the proportion of the vote Ross Perot won in the area back in the 1992 presidential race, and most of it coming at the expense of GOP state Assemblywoman Jane Corwin.

But Mr. Davis may be suffering a public relations meltdown that's the equal of Donald Trump, another strong-willed businessman. He has been captured on YouTube swatting at a tracker for another campaign who asked him why he was dropping out of tonight's Congressional debate. Mr. Davis can be seen laughing afterwards.

As for the debate, Mr. Davis says he won't participate because of the untruths other candidates are spreading about him. "Jane Corwin and [Democratic candidate] Kathy Hochul are professional politicians. They are lying about me and my record . . .. I will not lend my integrity and my reputation for honesty to a forum with two politicians who will say anything to get elected." 

Given that Mr. Davis doesn't seem willing to undergo any sort of scrutiny of his eclectic views—which range from slapping huge tariffs on goods made in China to opposing Medicare reform—it's no surprise that tea party groups are quickly distancing themselves from him. The Tea Party Express has announced it will run ads in the district warning voters that Mr. Davis is sailing under a false flag.
