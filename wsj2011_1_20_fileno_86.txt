Mets manager Terry Collins named pitcher Mike Pelfrey the team's Opening Day starter Wednesday. The decision was expected, with Johan Santana recovering from shoulder surgery and out until at least June. Mr. Pelfrey, 27, went 15-9 with a 3.66 ERA last season. "He's earned it," Mr. Collins said. "He should have made the All-Star team last year. Right now I think Mike Pelfrey should be the No. 1 guy on this staff." The Mets open the season April 1 in Miami against the Florida Marlins.

Don't close the door just yet on Andy Pettitte's return to the mound. Yankee manager Joe Girardi said that the pitcher has been working out, and even throwing, and his decision may still come down to the final weeks before spring training.

"There's no rush. There really isn't. Because he is training. [and] I believe he is throwing, yeah. He wants to be prepared no matter what his decision is," Mr. Girardi said.

With pitchers and catchers reporting Feb. 14, Mr. Girardi said he'd check in with Mr. Pettitte next week and try to get a final word.

"I'll probably call him sometime next week, see where he's at, what he's doing, what he's thinking," Girardi said.

Yankees GM Brian Cashman, however, did his best to tamp down any speculation by repeating the party line, saying "Andy is not in play."

After missing last week's divisional-round game against New England with a groin injury, Brad Smith, the Jets' kick-returner and "wildcat" specialist, practiced Wednesday and hopes he'll be able to play Sunday in the AFC Championship Game. "It's still early in the week," he said, "but from the progress I saw today out there and how I feel, it's real, real encouraging."
