 The Spiciest New Cookbook 

If you want to know whether somebody belongs to the gastroscenti, just check his or her fridge. Do you see a rooster-emblazoned plastic bottle filled with red sauce? Bingo. If you want to cook or eat like one of these people, you'll need to understand how to use Vietnam-born Huy Fong's American adaptation of Thai chili paste (Nám Prík Sriracha). That's where "The Sriracha Cookbook" (Ten Speed Press) comes in, with recipes from Bacon-Sriracha Cornbread to Peach-Sriracha Sorbet. $10, amazon.com  

 Instant SABOR  

Popular throughout Spain and South America, horchata, a sweet rice-based drink, has been showing up in the United States—at taquerias, on ice cream flavor lists and even in song lyrics (Vampire Weekend named a track for it). American company Maria Elena's certified-organic powder mix, based on the Mexican version (sugar, cinnamon and vanilla), lets you whip up the drink at home by just adding water (although almond milk does wonders). It tastes like liquid rice pudding and can be served hot or chilled. $4, mexgrocer.com  

 Delicious Dough 

"Sweets seem very innocent, but they are the most powerful food group. They can take people over," says Loren Brill, whose line of homemade cookie and brownie dough is poised for freezer domination. The latest winner of The Next Big Small Brand competition for New York City's emerging food artisans, Ms. Brill's bake-'em-yourself goods, are made with better-for-you ingredients (whole grains, coconut oil, natural sweeteners). $7, sweetlorens.com

The drink horchata is rice-based in its Mexican version but nut-based in some other regions. This column incorrectly said it was only rice-based.
