 Season Four 

Fans unnerved by reports that season five of AMC's retro series may be delayed can take comfort in season four on DVD. Last season kicked off with the recently divorced Betty and Don Draper beginning their separate lives and the ad men finding their way at their new company. DVD extras include documentaries on divorce in the 1960s and the original marketing for Ford Mustang.

The immersive, gently paced series from "The Wire" creator David Simon picks up in New Orleans, three months after Hurricane Katrina hit. Focused on the culture and characters of the historic Tremé neighborhood, the show is punctuated by musical interludes and impromptu concerts. Cast includes John Goodman and Melissa Leo. Season two premieres April 24 on HBO.

 Season One 

The 1959 series, based upon Hank Ketcham's comic strip, starred Jay North as Dennis Mitchell, a mischievous child with the best of intentions. In the first episode, Dennis's neighbor, Mr. Wilson, is arrested on suspicion of armed robbery when he's found with Dennis's cap pistol.
