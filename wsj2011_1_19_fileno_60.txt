The owners of a Mediterranean mansion in the Bronx are ready to trade their historic home for a loft apartment in Manhattan.

The home, owned by Columbia University researchers  Thomas Jessell and  Jane Dodd, is tucked away in a private enclave known as Fieldston, a historic district located in the Bronx's upscale Riverdale section. The couple originally decided to visit Fieldston only reluctantly, after prodding by a friend who lived in the area.

The owners of this mansion in the Bronx, with original Spanish-style tiling and English gardens, are ready to trade their historic home for a loft apartment in Manhattan.

"It appealed to the European in us," said Dr. Jessell of the Spanish-style home. "In a period of temporary insanity, we decided that we had to have it."

The couple purchased the 8,132-square-foot home in 1999 for $1.85 million, according to property records. The home was built in the 1920s by renowned architect  Dwight James Baum, according to the property listing by  Anne Shahmoon of Sotheby's International Realty.

The owners, while keeping most of the seven-bedroom structure intact, enlarged the kitchen and removed a part of the ceiling to create a double-height eat-in area. They also bleached the oak floors and painted much of the home white to brighten the space. 

"We didn't want to lose the character of the house because it's part of what makes it special," Dr. Jessell said. The renovations cost around $1 million, he said.

The home has original Mediterranean tiling throughout, including blue tiles that outline one of its 6Â½ bathrooms. The living room features an original stone fireplace as well as dark wood beams that run along the ceiling.

With two children in college and one not far from leaving the nest, the couple put the home on the market in November for $4.5 million. 

"The home is best suited for a family with kids because of its scale," Dr. Jessell said. "Having two people living in it sort of does it injustice."
