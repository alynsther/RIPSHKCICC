Kris Humphries grabbed a career-high 23 rebounds and made several big plays in overtime, leading the New Jersey Nets to just their fifth road win on Wednesday night over the Cleveland Cavaliers.

Jordan Farmar's two free throws with 3.8 seconds left sealed it for the Nets, who snapped a four-game losing streak and are now 5-29 in road games.
