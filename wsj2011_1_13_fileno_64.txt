Investors snapped up U.S. stocks after a Portuguese government-debt auction eased immediate worries about the euro zone.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished higher by 83.56 points, or 0.72%, at 11755.44, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 11.47 points, or 0.9%, to 1285.95 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 20.50 points, or 0.75% to 2737.33.



European stocks rallied to a 52-week high and the euro jumped 1.2% against the dollar after the Portuguese government sold €1.25 billion ($1.62 billion) in bonds in an auction at yields that were below market expectations. The auction offered a dose of good news after days of mounting concern over Portugal's finances, with investors fretting that economic growth could be stunted if governments are forced to enact tougher austerity measures.

The Stoxx Europe 600 index finished 1.4% higher to put it at its highest close since September 2008. Spain's IBEX 35 index surged 5.3%, while Italian stocks advanced 3.8% and Portugal's PSI 20 gained 2.4%.

"Optimism is not in short supply," said  Bob Jergovic, chief investment officer at CLS Investments. "I'm just watching with amazement as the market churns higher."

However, some said Wednesday's auction couldn't paper over longer-term concerns over the European debt situation, particularly with future auctions ahead for Spain and Italy.

"What they're doing with Portugal is an extension of what they did with Ireland and Greece—they're not really fixing the core problem, they're buying time," said  Paul Simon, chief investment officer for Tactical Allocation Group in Birmingham, Mich.

The market also was responding to another step up in U.S. import prices in December, rounding out their biggest three-month gain in over a year on the back of resurgent energy prices.

The price of imported goods rose 1.1% in December, following an upwardly revised 1.5% increase in November, versus an initial estimate of 1.3%. The numbers suggest that fears of inflation could begin to creep into the market, ahead of producer and consumer price index numbers in the coming days.

"Clearly energy and food are going higher, and that's directly related to what's going on in the commodity market," said  Kenneth Polcari, managing director at Icap Corporates. "That's something to be concerned about, with oil pretty close to $100 now ... the public is feeling it a lot more right now than the Fed is willing to admit right now."

Copper jumped 1.5%, while oil added 0.8% to settle at $91.86 a barrel. Gold edged up as well.

Treasurys sold off, pushing the yield on the benchmark 10-year note higher to 3.353%. Bond yields move inversely to prices. An auction of 10-year notes was very well-received, with bids coming in at rates not seen since last April.
