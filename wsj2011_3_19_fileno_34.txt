Jason Bay's so-called "power" all but disappeared last summer in his first season with the Mets. In fact, his year-to-year home run rate declined more than any slugger since 2000.

Bay needed just 14.6 at-bats per home run for the Red Sox in 2009. One season and a four-year, $66 million contract later, Bay's home run rate dropped to one home run for every 58 at- bats (he hit six). These are power numbers more fitting for a utility infielder. Blaming the decidedly less cozy confines of Citi Field doesn't cut it once you notice that Bay needed 63 at bats for every homer in road games last season.

The hope for the Mets and their fans is that Bay's slugging slump last year was a fluke. Looking at a list of players who saw a similar year-to-year decline since 2000, there's some hope for Bay in 2011. Many of these slumping sluggers were able to rebound the following year. On average, the eight hitters comparable to Bay improved from one home run every 34 at-bats in the slump year to one home run every 20.1 at-bats the next year. 

However, history suggests the improvement may be temporary. For the rest of their careers, our sluggers' rate of at-bats per homer never fully rebounded. Plus Bay's drop in 2010 was epic—more than twice that of all but one other slugger on the list. The most comparable drop was that of Morgan Ensberg in 2004, who is second on the list. Ensberg was only able to compile 1,269 at-bats before being forced into retirement in 2008 at age 32. That's exactly how old Bay is this year. 

Bay's performance thus far this spring is hardly encouraging—no homers in 33 at-bats. His 11 strikeouts suggest he's his still swinging for the fences, which at this point must seem miles away.

Since 2000, here are the players with the worst year-to-year declines in home runs per at-bat (min. 400 at-bats per season and 16 at-bats per home run the first year)
