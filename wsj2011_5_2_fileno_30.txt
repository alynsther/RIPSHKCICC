MUMBAI â€“ Indian shares ended down for the sixth straight day Monday, extending their losing run to the longest since early January as concerns about an expected policy rate increase by the Reserve Bank of India, coupled with a spate of poor quarterly earnings from mid-sized lenders, spurred selling in banks. 

The Bombay Stock Exchange's Sensitive Index fell 137.94 points, or 0.7%, to close at 18998.02--its lowest close since March 28--after moving between 18954.76 and 19253.87. 

On the National Stock Exchange, the 50-stock S&P CNX Nifty fell 48.20 points, or 0.8%, to end at 5701.30. 

Trading volume on the BSE fell to 24.10 billion rupees ($545 million) from Friday's 29.92 billion rupees. Gainers lagged decliners 1,032 to 1,810, while 106 stocks were unchanged. 

The losses in India stood in sharp contrast to gains in global markets following news that al Qaeda leader  Osama bin Laden had been killed in a U.S. attack. 

Many markets were closed for the Labor Day holiday, but Japan's Nikkei jumped 1.6% and Korea's Kospi ended 1.7% higher. In Europe, Germany's DAX was trading 0.9% higher, while France's CAC was up 0.3%. 

"The [Indian] market is assuming a doomsday kind of scenario ahead of the credit policy and investors are also nervous about the RBI's tone on inflation," said  Jagdish Malkani, country head of investment bank TAIB Capital. 

If the central bank's tone and actions are less hawkish than expected, banks could stage a rally Tuesday, he added. 

The RBI's rate-setting meeting is scheduled for Tuesday. In a poll of 15 analysts, 10 expected a 0.25 percentage point increase in key interest rates, while the remaining forecast a 0.5 percentage point rise. 

Of the 30 Sensex constituents, 22 ended lower Monday. 

Banking stocks led the decliners for the second consecutive session as investors fretted that a sharp policy rate increase by the RBI would increase deposit costs for banks. 

"After a lower-than-expected government borrowing figure in the 2011-2012 budget, there were expectations that deposit rates will fall. But that hasn't happened and mid-sized public sector lenders such as Bank of India have disappointed on earnings," said Angel Broking Vice President  Vaibhav Agrawal. 

State Bank of India, the country's largest lender by assets, fell 4.1% to 2,691.65 rupees and ICICI Bank closed off 1.4% at 1,098.20 rupees. 

Reliance Industries, which has the largest weight in the Sensex, fell 1.8% to 964.70 rupees on persistent concerns about falling gas output from the company's fields off India's east coast. 

Among other decliners,  Sterlite Industries fell 2.3% to 177.00 rupees and Maruti Suzuki, the country's largest car maker by sales, closed 2.2% down at 1,291.20 rupees.

Gainers were led by  Infosys Technologies after the company unveiled a new management structure over the weekend. The stock rose 0.6% to 2,923.35 rupees.

Realty stocks rose on bargain buying after recent sharp falls, lead by DLF, which closed 1.7% higher at 226.00 rupees.

Cipla rose 2.0% to 314.90 rupees as investors bought pharmaceutical stocks as a defense against further Sensex falls.
