NEW DELHIâ€”India's federal government Tuesday announced the withdrawal of a proposed tax on health-care services after strong protests from opposition political parties and the general public. 

"We have decided to exempt the new levy in its entirety, both in respect of services provided by hospitals as well as by way of diagnostic tests until the Goods and Services Tax comes into force," Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said in Parliament. 

In the annual budget for the next fiscal year starting on April 1, Mr. Mukherjee proposed introducing a tax on services provided by air-conditioned hospitals with more than 25 beds and diagnostic labs.
