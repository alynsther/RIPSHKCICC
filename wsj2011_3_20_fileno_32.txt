The Internal Revenue Service has made it easier to deal with your tax debt.

Under new rules issued on Feb. 24, the IRS is making it easier to obtain a "lien withdrawal," which removes a lien from public records, according to the agency.

Individuals who pay off their debt in full and certain people who are currently paying down tax debt of $25,000 or less are now eligible to apply for a withdrawal. They will need to fill out IRS Form 12277: Application for Withdrawal.

To qualify for a lien withdrawal, you must currently owe $25,000 or less, sign up for automatic withdrawals if you're still making payments to the IRS and you can't have any other tax debts.

The IRS also has stopped automatically filing liens on most people owing $10,000 or less in taxes, double the previous limit, according to the agency.

Another rule change allows those with higher income and bigger debts to participate in the "offer in compromise program," which lets taxpayers settle debts by paying a lesser amount than they owe.

The program is now open to single and joint filers who make a maximum of $100,000 and owe $50,000 or less in taxes. That's double the previous limits of $50,000 maximum income and $25,000 or less in tax debt.
