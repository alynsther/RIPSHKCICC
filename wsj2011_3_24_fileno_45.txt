If anyone needed further evidence of the popularity of Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter, Major League Baseball and its players association provided it Wednesday when it revealed that more people bought Jeter's jersey in 2010 than any other player's. Jeter was one of three Yankees among the top 20 jersey-sellers, according to sales of official Majestic jerseys in 2010; Alex Rodriguez's was ninth, and Mark Teixeira's was 11th. There were no Mets in the top 20.

Discussing whether Bartolo Colon would get a final spring start this weekend, Yankees manager Joe Girardi explained why it's likely he wouldn't, with opening day looming next Thursday. 

"If a guy makes a start on Sunday, and he's possibly on your team, and he's possibly going to be the long man, you're really going to limit how many pitches he could possibly give you on Thursday." 

For Girardi, that's as good as announcing that Colon will fill the long relief role. Minutes later, Girardi said that Colon had been the most impressive older player in camp, and noted that he's had bullpen experience before, allowing him to step into a potential relief role.

Another discarded Met found a job Wednesday. Two days after being released by the Mets, pitcher Oliver Perez agreed to a minor-league deal with the Washington Nationals, according to the team's official website. Even if Perez makes the major-league roster, the Nationals would only have to pay him $414,000, the major-league minimum salary. The Mets would still owe him the remainder of the $12 million left on his contract. Earlier this week, former Mets second baseman Luis Castillo signed a minor-league deal with the Philadelphia Phillies.
