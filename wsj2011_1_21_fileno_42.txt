Normally a gala dinner might have a musical performance to cap off dinner—Patti Smith, John Legend, Kelli O'Hara from "South Pacific," and the cast of "Memphis" have all been recent favorites—but on Wednesday, at Banking on a Cure, the New York Visionary Awards Dinner celebrating Wall Street's vision and benefiting the Foundation Fighting Blindness, there was a stand-up comic.

His name is Jake Johannsen, and his set involved discussion about bacon alarm clocks, shirts with sun protection factor in them ("Don't all shirts have SPF in them?" he asked. "Like this roof. It protects us from the sun.") and terrorists. It wasn't until he got to a section about the underpants bomber that he really got the dwindling audience's attention.

"I've done these kind of events before," said Mr. Johannsen, who was flown in by the charity from Los Angeles, after he got off the stage. "One was the Denver Food Bank, and I did another one in San Francisco. It usually works better between the meal and the live auction, instead of at the end of the night, but not everyone's in show business, so they don't know."

How does working a room of social New Yorkers compare to a comedy club? "My material has to be a little more clean," he said. "The room at The Plaza is beautiful, though."

The evening honored, among others, Aryeh Bourkoff, the Vice Chairman and Global Head of Technology, Media and Telecoms for UBS Investment Bank. Mr. Bourkoff said events for the organization had previously raised about $300,000; this raised $1 million. 

Dressed in a red tie, blue shirt and a sleek Brioni suit, he was asked if the dress code at UBS had made people pay more attention to his attire.

"We try to be well-kempt," he said. "But in investment-banking divisions you're judged on your deals and your transactions."
