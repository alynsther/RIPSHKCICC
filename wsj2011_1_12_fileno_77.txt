Rex Ryan placed his signature blitzing schemes in mothballs for all but two plays in the Jets' Wild Card win over Peyton Manning's Colts. The numbers say any chance for a Jets upset of Tom Brady and the Patriots will require a similarly conservative defensive approach.

Mr. Brady's yards-per-pass attempt when the Jets blitz has steadily climbed in each successive meeting against Mr. Ryan's defense. The trend is unlikely to continue, but that's only because Mr. Brady last outing against the Jets' extra rushers was superhuman—18.1 yards on average against the 11 blitz calls. His QB rating against the blitz was a near perfect 154.4, keying the Patriots 45-3 win.

Mr. Brady's performance that Monday night was quite similar to the way Mr. Manning carved up the Jets in last season's AFC Championship game. With his strength suddenly a weakness this year, Mr. Ryan countered by dropping more defenders into coverage. The Colts scored just one touchdown in the Jets 17-16 victory last Saturday.

Moderation will likely be key if the Jets blitz. This season versus five rushers, Mr. Brady's yards-per-pass attempt is 8.2 with a 101.3 QB rating (100 attempts). Hall of Fame numbers, yes, but nowhere near as good as when teams send six or more rushers his way. Then, Mr. Brady sports a 153.8 QB rating, gaining 330 yards on just 25 pass attempts.

But while faking the blitz worked against Mr. Manning and the Colts, Mr. Brady has now seen that ploy by the Jets. Perhaps that's why Mr. Ryan maintains that the outcome of Sunday's game rests squarely on his coaching shoulders.
