Peyton Manning and the Colts paid Darrelle Revis the ultimate compliment on Sunday when they virtually ignored the wide receiver he was single-covering, AFC receptions leader Reggie Wayne.

Mr. Wayne caught just one ball on Saturday night, a screen pass good for one yard. Most noteworthy, however, was that this one pass was the only one Mr. Manning threw in Mr. Wayne's direction all game. As is customary for him, Mr. Revis was covering Mr. Wayne with no help from any teammates. Normally, not even double-coverage dissuades Mr. Manning from throwing the ball in the direction of his five-time Pro Bowl receiver. Mr. Wayne was thrown to 176 times during the regular season, second most in football.

Since 2000, no wide receiver thrown to 150 or more times in the regular season was targeted less frequently in a playoff game than Mr. Wayne. The Patriots similarly ignored Randy Moss in a 2008 playoff win against the Jaguars only because Mr. Moss was shadowed all day by two and sometimes three defenders. Tom Brady exploited the extra attention given to Mr. Moss by targeting everyone else and completed a postseason record 26 of 28 passes (93% completion rate).

Mr. Brady is next up for Mr. Revis and the Jets defense. The bad news for Jets fans is that the Patriots passing game is far more diversified than Indianapolis's. Wes Welker was thrown to just 123 times, leading the team. And since beginning of New England's eight-game winning streak, he's one of three receivers to have been targeted most in a single game. The Patriots thus seem better suited than the Colts were to play a 10-on-10 game that renders meaningless Mr. Revis's unique ability to erase opposing wideouts. 

The fewest targets to a wide receiver in a playoff game, among receivers who saw 150 or more targets in the regular season (since 2000).
