Italian novelist Sandro Veronesi's "Quiet Chaos" has an explosive opening. A TV executive named Pietro is on a beach with his brother, Carlo, when they see two women drowning. The men race to save them, but Pietro is pulled under by the woman he grabs: "I don't want to die, I'm thinking. I love life. I have a woman and a daughter waiting for me at home. I'm supposed to get married in five days. I'm forty-three years old. I have a job, dammit, I can't die." And Pietro doesn't die—but when he staggers to his seaside home, he finds that his fiancée, Lara, has died of a heart attack.

Pietro and Lara had a 10-year-old daughter, Claudia; together they return to his Milan apartment, and he begins a boycott of normal life. Every day, he stands outside Claudia's school from the time he drops her off until she re-emerges. Remarkably, Mr. Veronesi sustains the opening scene's excitement as he stirs a psychological ferment from almost no action—a condition that Pietro calls "frenzied stasis." As crises crowd in on him—from his troubled family, the woman his brother saved, his business associates—his sanctuary outside the school comes to seem like the eye of a storm.

The overpowering sense of fragility that touches Pietro and Claudia is superbly conveyed by translator Michael F. Moore. Let's hope more novels from Mr. Veronesi's back catalog join "Quiet Chaos" in translation.
