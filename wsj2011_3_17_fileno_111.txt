If experience is what matters most in pressure-packed NCAA tournament games, St. John's is the team to circle in your office pool this year.

In fact, the Red Storm has the best combination of experience and tournament seeding in recent years. College-basketball stats guru Ken Pomeroy has created an "experience rating" that weights eligibility class by minutes played—so playing all seniors every minute gets you the maximum ranking of 3.00. St. John's 2.68 is the highest figure for a team seeded No. 8 or better since Pomeroy first began tracking the stat in 2007. While starting senior guard/forward D.J. Kennedy tore his ACL in last weekend's Big East tournament, the Red Storm still dress eight seniors. 

The second-most experienced team among first-round favorites (based on tournament seeding) was sixth-seeded Notre Dame's 2.61 in 2010. The Fighting Irish dropped a 51-50, first-round heartbreaker to Old Dominion, but other senior-heavy teams have fared better. Three of our eight most experienced first-round favorites advanced to the Sweet 16. Seventh-seeded UNLV (2.44 in 2007) and fifth-seeded Butler (2.25 in 2007) exceeded expectations, and fourth-seeded Washington State (2.43) also made it through. By this measure, St. John's is also the second most experienced team in the whole tournament behind 14-seed Wofford (2.71), a team it could theoretically face on Saturday.

If you're looking for an early mismatch in term of experience, focus on three-seed Connecticut (0.96). The Huskies, who are the only top-seed with a score below 1, face Bucknell (1.54) in the West. Last year, a similarly inexperienced No. 1 seed (Kentucky, 0.83) was upset by West Virginia (1.80) in the Elite Eight.

Since 2007, the most experienced tournament teams seeded 1-7, based on a rating that weights playing time and class (3.00 is max).
