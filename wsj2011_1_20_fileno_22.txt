NEW DELHI -- A panel of Indian ministers has approved a plan to electronically auction licenses in the third phase of the country's FM radio expansion plan, a senior government official said Thursday.

The move comes after a similar auction, where bids are placed online, for licenses to offer third-generation mobile telecommunications and wireless broadband Internet services last year fetched about $22.7 billion, more than three times the government's initial estimate.

"The effort will be to maximize revenue for the government," the official, who didn't want to be named, told Dow Jones Newswires. "The modalities are being worked out."

India has 248 FM radio stations spread across 86 cities. The government is planning to sell more than 800 licenses in the third phase.

Companies such as HT Media Ltd., Entertainment Networks India Ltd., Sun TV Network Ltd. and Midday Multimedia Ltd. operate FM stations in India.
