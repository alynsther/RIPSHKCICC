KIEV, Ukraine—Prosecutors charged former President  Leonid Kuchma on Thursday in the murder of an investigative journalist 10-½ years ago, but he could avoid jail time even if convicted of involvement in post-Soviet Ukraine's most notorious crime.

Mr. Kuchma, who led the country from 1994 to 2005, was accused of "exceeding his authority, which led to the murder of journalist  Georgy Gongadze."  Yuri Boichenko, a spokesman for the general prosecutor's office, said further charges could be brought as the pre-trial investigation continues.

The headless body of Mr. Gongadze, a fierce critic of Mr. Kuchma's presidency, was found in woods near Kiev shortly after he disappeared in September 2000.

Critics of Mr. Kuchma had been calling for him to be investigated since the end of 2000, when an opposition politician made public tapes in which a voice that sounds like Mr. Kuchma's gave orders to "deal with" Mr. Gongadze. The tapes have never been conclusively authenticated, but prosecutors said this week they would be considered as evidence.

The charge against Mr. Kuchma is subject to a 10-year statute of limitations. Under Ukrainian law, he can be tried. But if he's convicted, it would be up to the court whether to apply the statute or send him to prison for up to 12 years.

Three police officers are serving prison sentences for the murder. The deputy general prosecutor said Tuesday that Mr. Kuchma was being investigated on suspicion of having given orders to senior Interior Ministry officials that led to the slaying. Mr. Kuchma denies the charges against him.
