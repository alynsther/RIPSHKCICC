Scotland travels to England in rugby's Six Nations tournament on Sunday in a game that marks the centenary of the first meeting between these two at Twickenham, the home of English rugby.

Such has been England's dominance in this fixture that an entire generation of Scottish fans has grown up knowing nothing but defeat. In 100 years of matches in West London, Scotland has won just four timesâ€”the last victory coming back in 1983.

Scotland's head coach Andy Robinson, a former England coach, is bullish about his team's chances and Graham Steadman, the country's defense coach, said this week that stopping England's dangerous back three would be key to Scotland's chances.

Neutralizing the threat of full-back Ben Foden and wingers Chris Ashton and Mark Cueto might seem like a fairly obvious prescription, but the statistics suggest it's easier said than done: England's average winning margin in the last five encounters at Twickenham is 25.6 points.

Oddsmakers have England as a heavy favorite, even with a 15-point handicap, and given that Scotland has conceded four tries against France, two against Wales and was lucky to ship just three to Ireland, it's worth backing England to cover at evens with Victor Chandler.

Scotland has conceded in the opening 10 minutes of each of its three Six Nations matches so far, and Sporting Index quote the time of England's first try between 24 and 27 minutes, so selling at 24 is recommended.
