While working under sushi maestro  Masa Takayama uptown at Masa and Bar Masa, chefs  George Ruan and  Jack Wei fell in love with the fresh tofu skin—or yuba—that Mr. Takayama flew in fresh from Japan.

Yuba is a new restaurant in the East Village that offers Japanese cuisine with a few Western inflections.

As chef-owners of a new East Village restaurant named for the stuff, Messrs. Ruan and Wei include yuba in such preparations as uni with yuba ($16); in sushi rolls ($8); and grilled on its own, shatter-crisp and sweet, with miso and kinome ($8). 

The food, with or without tofu skin, keeps up with the Masa reputation for superb freshness, and features a few Western inflections. The uni rice is a risotto preparation of mochi rice with a dashi base with sea urchin ($23, $38 with white truffle). "It's very typical risotto-style, but the ingredients are very Japanese," Mr. Ruan said. 

For lunch, specials include sushi and sashimi sets with choice of soup or salad for $18, and a chef's choice of eight pieces of sushi with a roll for $28. Most of the dinner menu items can also be ordered at lunch.
