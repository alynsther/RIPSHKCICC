 IN "DRAWN TO LIFE: Al Hirschfeld and the Theater of Tennessee Williams"  at the Historic New Orleans Collection through April 3, the work of the playwright, who would have turned 100 Saturday, is depicted in dozens of drawings by the Broadway caricaturist. Here, Maureen Stapleton clings to Pamela Payton-Wright in "The Glass Menagerie" in 1975. There's also memorabilia like a streetcar sign box from the city's Desire line.
