The NBA playoffs have long been considered a battleground for the game's greatest big men—the time of year legends like Shaquille O'Neal, Hakeem Olajuwon and David Robinson built their legacies. Apparently, times have changed. 

The eight starting centers in the second round of the 2011 playoffs combined to average just 8.4 points and 6.9 rebounds per game during the regular season. Those numbers mark the worst totals in both categories among second-round starting centers in the past 20 years. No other group of bigs averaged fewer than seven rebounds, and only in 2007 did the centers average single-digit points—a group that included such luminaries as Francisco Elson and Andris Biedrins.

This year, the mainstays in the middle are nowhere to be found—Orlando's Dwight Howard and San Antonio's Tim Duncan lost in the first round, while Boston's O'Neal is injured and his status for the series remains shaky. Instead we're left with a combination of unproven but talented youngsters (Andrew Bynum, Joakim Noah) and a bunch of veterans who contribute little to the box score.

The prospect of watching Marc Gasol and Kendrick Perkins battle it out down low only makes us miss the matchups from the 1990s—Hakeem outdueling Shaq in the 1995 finals, or Alonzo Mourning routinely banging in the post with Patrick Ewing. From 1993 to 1997, the second-round centers averaged 17.5 points and 9.1 rebounds. In 1995 alone, three averaged more than 27 points—something a second-round center hasn't done since O'Neal in 2003.
