MUMBAI â€“Air passenger traffic in India grew 19% in 2010 as higher incomes and the introduction of new flights encouraged more people to take to the skies. 

Indian carriers flew 52 million passengers locally last year, compared with 44 million in 2009, the aviation ministry said Tuesday. It didn't provide details of local carriers' international traffic. 

The country's aviation industry has been on an upswing as growing businesses triggered corporate travel while higher disposable incomes allowed people to go for frequent leisure trips. Sydney-based consultancy Centre for Asia-Pacific Aviation estimates that Indian carriers would fly 180 million local passengers annually by 2020. 

Government figures showed that Indian carriers enhanced flight capacity by close to 10% almost every month in 2010, thereby giving people more flight options. 

Jet Airways Ltd. remained the country's biggest airline with a 26% market share. Jet, along with units JetLite and  Jet Konnect, carried about 13.5 million passengers last year. 

Kingfisher Airlines Ltd. followed Jet, flying 10.7 million passengers, while national carrier Air India ferried 9.2 million people. Indigo, the biggest low-fare carrier, flew more than 8 million passengers. SpiceJet Ltd., the second-ranked budget airline, carried about 6.7 million passengers during the year. 

The ministry also said that the airlines carried 5.2 million passengers in December. It didn't provide year-earlier figures.
