Euromedic International, a Dutch-based company offering medical services in Eastern Europe, has sold its kidney dialysis division to Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co. for €485 million ($648.5 million), the companies said Tuesday.

The deal gives Fresenius Medical Care a chain of dialysis clinics in the fast-growing healthcare markets of Eastern Europe and Russia. Fresenius Medical Care, a unit of Germany's Fresenius SE, already operates 2,700 dialysis clinics in North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia and Africa. 

The deal, which is still subject to regulatory approval, is another sign of the healthcare industry's drive to boost its presence in emerging markets such as Eastern Europe, where government and private spending on drugs and healthcare services is growing at a faster pace than in established Western markets. 

Euromedic provides kidney dialysis to over 8,000 patients in Eastern Europe. Fresenius Medical Care is one of the largest dialysis providers globally, treating more than 210,000 patients. Kidney dialysis is used to treat people with kidney failure. The patient's blood is transferred to the dialysis machine, where it is cleaned of toxins and waste products before being returned to the patient's body.

Euromedic is owned by three private-equity houses—BAML Capital Partners, Montagu Private Equity and Ares Life Sciences—which bought the company in 2008. 

Bank of America Merrill Lynch advised Euromedic on the deal. Fresenius didn't use a financial adviser.
