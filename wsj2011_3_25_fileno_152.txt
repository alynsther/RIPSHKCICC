PARISâ€”The French economy grew more than initially estimated in the last three months of 2010, the national statistics bureau said Friday, as it raised its growth estimate for the euro zone's second-largest economy. 

France's gross domestic product rose 0.4% from a quarter earlier and 1.5% from a year earlier, Insee said. Economists had expected GDP growth to remain unchanged from the previous estimate at 0.3%. 

A previous estimate for growth in the third quarter of 2010 was lowered to 0.2% from 0.3%, owing to the introduction of new statistics methodologies, Insee said. 

Separately, Insee said French consumer confidence fell in March back to its level in July 2010, as households started worrying about inflation. 

The consumer-confidence index in France stood at 83 in March, down from 85 in February, Insee said. Economists had expected French consumer sentiment to fall to just 84.

The data showed that in March more households thought that inflation would grow at a steady pace, as the gauge measuring the inflation outlook rose steeply to 10 from minus-five.
