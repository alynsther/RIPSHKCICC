Unhappy with your Medicare Advantage plan for this year? You have until Feb. 14 to switch to original Medicare.

A change could make sense for people who want to see doctors outside the plan, those who tend to spend time outside of a coverage area or those who find their Advantage plan too costly.

Advantage plans, which are run by private insurers, can charge lower premiums than other coverage. But there are out-of-pocket expenses and restrictions on which doctors you can see. (With cuts in federal subsidies coming in 2012, insurers have cut the number of Advantage plans they offer.)

If switching, be aware that original Medicare doesn't cover prescription drugs. So you'll need to enroll in Medicare Part D. And there are coverage gaps that are usually covered by private Medigap insurance plans.

Monthly premiums for Advantage plans run about $161 on average, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Original Medicare with Part D has an average monthly premium of $142, though if you add a Medigap plan that cost could more than double.

Still, when you factor in the out-of-pocket costs for an Advantage plan, some seniors with a lot of medical expenses may fare better with traditional Medicare and a Medigap plan, says  Joe Baker, president of the Medicare Rights Center.
