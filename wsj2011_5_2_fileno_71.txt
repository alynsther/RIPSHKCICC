PHILADELPHIA—

With his team in the midst of facing three of the best pitchers in baseball, Terry Collins's thoughts drifted to his own ace.

Before Sunday's game against the Philadelphia Phillies, Collins said Johan Santana was playing catch at up to 150 feet and was expected to begin throwing off a mound within two weeks. 

"He feels great, which is great news," Collins said.

Of course, that is of little help to the Mets at the moment. They faced Roy Halladay on Saturday, Cliff Lee Sunday and are slated to face San Francisco Giants ace Tim Lincecum Wednesday at Citi Field. In the best-case scenario, Santana is still more than two months from pitching in the majors again.

Times like these remind Collins of what he and the Mets are missing. The idea of Santana tossing a ball in Port St. Lucie—and the hope that he may yet help the Mets in 2011—gives a manager comfort.
