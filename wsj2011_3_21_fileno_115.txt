For the pianist and performance artist Kathleen Supové, "Music With a View" is "the best name I've ever come up with for anything." A festival of works by emerging and established composers that she's curating for TriBeCa's Flea Theater, it reflects the idea "that people are viewing it, and not just listening," a challenge to the typically staid setup for contemporary classical music concerts. The festival runs March 22-April 3 and tickets are free.

When asked to categorize her picks, Ms. Supové tabulated that nearly a quarter of the concerts used video, and she listed a wide array of featured visual stimuli including a burlesque dancer, toy pianos, sculpture, iPhones, a digital marimba and a robot that plays an orchestra of Balinese instruments. 

Plenty to look at, and plenty to talk about, which is intended, because the festival is also about "music with viewpoints," she said. Discussions hosted by established figures in the community follow each concert. Ms. Supové said she discourages hosts from getting "too nerdy or technical." She embraces new audiences and stressed that she made her selections not simply to stimulate the new-music cognoscenti, but for an imagined "thoughtful listener." She said: "Typical New Yorkers, basically, who would go and see art, and maybe not understand every stroke, but there's a whole concept they're becoming aware of, a whole world to appreciate there."
