Two schooners sailing close-hauled through the rough September seas of Vineyard Sound off Massachusetts—the photograph above is a timeless evocation of American boating. The wooden boats are timeless, too. But there is a difference. The schooner When and If, in the foreground, was designed in 1939 by John G. Alden, one of America's great naval architects, renowned for his ocean racers. (It was built for a Col. George S. Patton; the boat's name reflected Patton's plans to sail around the world "when and if" he returned from the war that loomed—he did not.) Rebecca, in the distance, is of much more recent vintage, designed in 1998 by Nat Benjamin. But as "The Book of Wooden Boats" (Norton, 191 pages, $60) makes clear, a carpentered vessel of any age can be glorious to behold—especially in darkest winter, especially when photographed by Benjamin Mendlowitz. For nearly 30 years, he has been shooting an annual calendar of wooden boats that is a fixture at boatyards and on office walls around the world. The photos form the basis of his "Wooden Boats" book series. Mr. Mendlowitz's latest volume, with text by Maynard Bray, is his third, and it continues a tradition of displaying handsome classics of naval architecture—and stirring countless daydreams.
