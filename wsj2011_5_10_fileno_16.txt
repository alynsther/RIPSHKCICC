NEW DELHI â€“ NTPC Ltd. Tuesday topped market expectations with a 38% rise in fourth-quarter net profit, as India's largest power producer by capacity benefited from higher sales and a change in accounting rules. 

Profit for the three months through March grew to 27.82 billion rupees ($623 million) from 20.18 billion rupees a year earlier, the state-run utility said. The average of forecasts in a poll of 16 analysts was for net profit of 23.49 billion rupees. 

Sales rose 26% to 155.19 billion rupees from 123.5 billion rupees. 

The robust results will help the company allay investors' concerns about its performance amid problems in sourcing of fuel to run its power stations. NTPC's net profit for the first two quarters of the last financial year was lower than year-earlier levels and was little changed in the third quarter. 

NTPC shares gained after the results and closed 4.3% higher at 180.25 rupees, outpacing a flat Mumbai market. 

The company said that a change in accounting rules helped drag its depreciation cost for the quarter down 4.6% to 6.98 billion rupees. 

The company, which mostly operates coal-fired power plants, also said that its fuel costs grew 16.5% to 97.26 billion rupees.

For the financial year through March, net profit increased 4% to 91.02 billion rupees and sales rose 19% to 548.74 billion rupees. 

NTPC accounts for a fifth of India's installed generation capacity of 173.6 gigawatts and plans to more than double its capacity to 75,000 megawatts by 2017. 

The company plans to add 5,000 MW of capacity each year for the next six years, with an annual capital expenditure of 160 billion rupees to 170 billion rupees, its chairman  Arup Roy Choudhury said on April 29. 

Separately, Coal Minister Sriprakash Jaiswal said Tuesday he is willing to review the ministry's decision to cancel allocation of some coal blocks to NTPC. 

The coal ministry last week cancelled the allocation of five coal blocks of NTPC due to a delay in their development.
