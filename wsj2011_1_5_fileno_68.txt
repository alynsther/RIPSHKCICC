  Nicholas Brooks, accused of killing his fashion designer girlfriend at an exclusive Manhattan hotel-spa last month, pleaded not guilty to a second-degree murder charge Tuesday.

The plea, in Manhattan Supreme Court, came a day after it was revealed that prosecutors had upgraded the charge against Mr. Brooks. He initially faced an attempted-murder charge in connection with the death of his 33-year-old girlfriend, swimsuit designer  Sylvie Cachay. The charge was elevated to second-degree murder after the medical examiner's office ruled that Ms. Cachay's death was a homicide.

Shortly after the hearing, at which Mr. Brooks spoke only to announce his plea, the district attorney's office released statements purportedly made by Mr. Brooks following Ms. Cachay's death. 

According to the statement, Mr. Brooks denied running a bath for Ms. Cachay in the Soho House before leaving the hotel to have drinks. He said she was sleeping and that he never went near the bath, according to court papers.

Prosecutors say Ms. Cachay was found lifeless with bloodied eyes and a compressed neck in an overflowing bathtub on Dec. 9.

They cite surveillance footage at the hotel allegedly showing that Mr. Brooks was the only other person who spent considerable time in the room in which Ms. Cachay was found.

An attorney for Mr. Brooks, Jeffrey Hoffman, said he hadn't had a chance to review the unsealed court papers. "From what I know now, my client was not present when this young lady died," he said.

Mr. Brooks remained held without bail, and will return to court Feb. 8. He faces 25 years to life in prison if convicted.
