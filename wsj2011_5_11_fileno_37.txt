MUMBAIâ€” State Bank of India said late Tuesday it raised its key benchmark lending rates by 0.75 percentage point each. 

India's largest bank by both loans and deposits said its prime lending rate will stand at 14% with effect Thursday. State Bank's other benchmark rate, the base rate, will be 9.25%, also effective Thursday, it said in a release to stock exchanges. 

The base rate is the rate below which banks cannot price any loans. 

The move comes after the Reserve Bank of India's 0.50-percentage point incraese in its key policy rate May 3, and follows  ICICI Bank Ltd.'s 0.50-percentage-point increase in its base rate last week.
