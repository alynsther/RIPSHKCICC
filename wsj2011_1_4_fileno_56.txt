Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan said Tuesday that he wants to begin negotiations with the country's opposition parties on the politically sensitive issue of increasing the national consumption tax, with a target of having a plan in place by June.

With a massive revenue gap at more than 50% of annual government spending and the need to increase entitlements on retirement and health care as the society ages, economists and many government officials say there is little choice but to raise taxes in some form.

"It is clear to everyone that we must debate a tax overhaul—including the consumption tax—from the perspective of the social security system and the necessary resources required" Mr. Kan said in his New Year's news conference.

Mr. Kan proposed last June that the current 5% consumption tax be raised to 10% in stages. 

But the move made no headway, as opposition party lawmakers and even some ruling-party politicians opposed the idea. Legislators' enthusiasm toward tax increases also waned after the ruling Democratic Party suffered a crushing defeat in July's Upper House elections, which analysts say was caused partly by Mr. Kan's tax plan.

"I would like to open non-partisan consultations involving the ruling and opposition parties at the earliest date on social security and financing issues, and by around June, I want to offer a direction," Mr. Kan said.

It remains uncertain, over whether Mr. Kan can succeed in his renewed effort and whether he can even remain in office to see his plans through. His government's support rate is languishing around 20% according to recent opinion polls conduct by domestic media. 

The opposition, sensing the chance to bring down the government, have meanwhile grown increasingly uncooperative.
