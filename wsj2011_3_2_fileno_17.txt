DUBLIN—Six Irish banks had €16.4 billion ($22.58 billion) outstanding of senior bonds that aren't guaranteed by the government or secured on mortgages, the Central Bank of Ireland said Wednesday, as it revealed the extent of the banks' liabilities for the first time. 

The six banks have a further €19 billion in senior bonds outstanding that are secured by collateral such as mortgage loans but not guaranteed by the government, and €20.9 billion in senior bonds that are guaranteed by the government, as of Feb. 18, the central bank said in a note. 

The issue of whether to make senior bondholders in Irish banks share the burden of restructuring the country's banks was a major issue during the election campaign, and in the coalition talks underway between Irish political parties Fine Gael and Labour. The two parties are expected to form a coalition government after the previous government suffered a historic defeat in last weekend's elections. 

Irish authorities have been criticized for their failure to publish the extent of the liabilities in the Irish banks. The central bank said Wednesday it was publishing the figures "in the interests of providing public information." 

The central bank said six banks have a further €6.9 billion in subordinated bonds outstanding. The banks are:  Allied Irish Bank, Bank of Ireland, Educational Building Society,  Irish Life and Permanent, Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society.
