The just-completed first weekend of the NCAA men's tournament isn't just about buzzer-beaters and Cinderella runs. It's also a great chance for young coaches, including assistants, to serve notice that they're ready to move on to a more-prominent gig.

But while a tournament run is a nice thing for an assistant to have on his résumé, it's no guarantee of head-coaching prosperity, according to a study from Winthrop Intelligence, a group that helps athletic directors optimize financial decisions. The 28 head coaches that have gone to the Final Four in the past decade have employed a total of 137 assistants that went on to head-coaching gigs. From 2000 through 2010, those 137 coaches won 51% of their games as head coaches. In the same span, 346 former assistants who didn't work for Final Four coaches won about 47% of games.

Among coaches that made Final Fours as assistants this decade, Alabama's Anthony Grant has the best record, while of the total 137 former assistants, Pittsburgh's Jamie Dixon (pictured) has the best record. That didn't help over the weekend, when his No. 1-seed Panthers lost to Butler.
