MUMBAIâ€”Indian shares snapped a two-session win streak in light range-bound trading, tracking declines in Asian and European markets amid escalating fighting in Libya. 

The Bombay Stock Exchange's Sensitive Index fell 141.97 points, or 0.8%, to 18327.98.26. On the National Stock Exchange, the 50-stock S&P CNX Nifty shed 36.6 points, or 0.7%, to end at 5,494.4. 

Trading volume on the BSE fell to 29.84 billion rupees ($661 million) from Wednesday's 34.17 billion rupees. Advancers lagged decliners 1,273 to 1,549, while 128 stocks were unchanged. 

Most Asian markets finished lower. Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 0.8%, Japan's Nikkei was down 1.5%, while China's Shanghai Composite lost 1.5%. 

In Europe, France's CAC was trading 0.8% lower while Germany's DAX was down 0.7%. 

"The [Indian] market was expected to remain under pressure, but it's a good sign that we haven't seen sharper falls amid negative global cues," said  Deven Choksey, managing director at K.R. Choksey Shares and Securities. 

He expects crude-oil prices to be the trigger for markets in the coming sessions. 

Of the 30 Sensex constituents, 21 ended lower Thursday. Banks led the losses after Reserve Bank of India governor Duvvuri Subbarao said banks should raise deposit rates and cut lending rates. 

ICICI Bank, which has an 8% weight in the Sensex, fell 1.9% to 1,014.25 rupees, while State Bank of India slipped 1.6% to 2,589.7 rupees. 

Tata Steel led declines in metals after the company said it expects a jump of around 15% in raw-material costs in the fiscal year that starts April 1, mainly because of Australia's recent floods and higher China demand. Tata Steel shed 2.6% to 596.8 rupees, while the metal subindex fell 1.8%. 

Real estate was one of the few sectors that investors bought, with the realty subindex rising 0.7%. DLF, the only real-estate company included in the Sensex, rose 1.4% to 228.5. 

Oil & Natural Gas rose 1.6% to 275.40 rupees following media reports that said the company's planned follow-on share sale has been further deferred to the quarter ending in September.
