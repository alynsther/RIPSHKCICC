The historic constitutional challenge to ObamaCare is gathering force, with Wisconsin, Wyoming, Ohio and Kansas in recent days starting to sign onto the original 20-state lawsuit. One state that won't be joining, however, is New Jersey, as Gov. Chris Christie declared yesterday during a meeting with The Wall Street Journal editorial board yesterday.

"For once New Jersey wants a free ride," he said. Mr. Christie said that the Supreme Court will ultimately rule, and the Garden State will have to live with the results either way. He added that the individual mandate was unprecedented in forcing individuals to buy a private product, but he'd rather not pay for attorney fees when other states are already doing the work.

A decision may be a fait accompli, but numbers and a united front would underscore the symbolic importance of the suit and its relevance to the balance of power under the Constitution's federal system. There are indirect fiscal benefits as well. Mr. Christie noted that New Jersey already has the second-richest Medicaid program in the country and that the program will "fall off the cliff" in 2016 as ObamaCare adds millions of new people to the rolls.

One wonders if there isn't some other rationale for the Republican governor's unusual apathy. After all, New Jersey remains a Democratic-leaning state and one of the few places where ObamaCare enjoys majority support among the public. Politicians always pick their spots.
