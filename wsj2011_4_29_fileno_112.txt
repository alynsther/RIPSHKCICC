The kind of soaring, weaving harmonies that used to be the province of Crosby, Stills & Nash have been commandeered by a new generation of singers. Here's a look at some of the many young acts embracing that sound, stepping up to their microphones in groups of two, three or more.

For this Seattle sextet's second album, "Helplessness Blues" (due Tuesday), lead singer Robin Pecknold wrote all the songs (and played about 10 instruments), but the band's trademark harmonies rely on three other band members. 

Riding a steadily-building wave of popularity, this U.K. group's debut album has been hovering in the Top 10 lately—more than a year after it was released. Signature song "Little Lion Man" features a crescendo of four-way "ahs" that rolls along for nearly a minute.

Known for a knotty, hypnotic sound and a taut dynamic on stage, this group of four L.A. women hinges on the guitar work and vocals of three members who have been friends since childhood.

The airy, layered vocals of this female trio (which includes a set of twins) float on instrumentation that draws on today's electronica as well as '70s R&B. Having released a three-song E.P. in March, King has benefited by endorsements by stars such as Erykah Badu.

Like CSN, this Philadelphia trio delivers not just its choruses but also many verses in lock-step harmony. It's a naturally sunny sound that the group scrambles with occasional jam-punk instrumentals.

Though the name conjures images of the beards so common to folk rock of recent years, Mountain Man features three women with a pastoral sound. In counterpoint, they sing a capella or, at most, accompanied by a single acoustic guitar.
