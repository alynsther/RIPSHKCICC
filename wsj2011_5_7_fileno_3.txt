JAKARTA, Indonesiaâ€”Southeast Asian nations will pledge to make maximum efforts and ensure timely implementation of measures needed for the economic integration of the region by 2015. 

"This would include addressing issues on constitutional, legislative, and regulatory limitations that are impending the implementation of intra - and extra-Asean commitments, as well as strengthening our respective national coordination to effectively implement our Asean Economic Community commitments across various ministries and agencies," according to the draft chairman's statement of the 18th meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations' leaders this weekend in the Indonesian capital city of Jakarta. 

The draft obtained by Dow Jones Newswires calls for increased support from all "concerned stakeholders and dialogue partners" for the expeditious implementation of the so-called Asean Integrated Food Security Framework. 

It will also intensify efforts to accelerate the process of consolidating Asean's Plus-One Free Trade Agreements. 

It added that progress has been made by four working groups tasked to look into the recommendations in the studies on the formation of a free-trade area in East Asia, the only remaining region without a regional trade agreement similar to the European Union or North America Free Trade Area.
