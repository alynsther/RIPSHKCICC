LONDON—European stocks ended with modest gains Friday, but fell nearly 3% for the week, as investors digested conflicting reports about the conflict in Libya and monitored Japan's nuclear crisis.

The Stoxx Europe 600 index gained 0.2% to end at 267.63. The index had risen as high as 269.78 on news that Libya's government has declared an immediate cease-fire after the United Nations authorized the use of force to protect civilians in the North African nation. 

Subsequently, however, media reports said that fierce fighting continued between opposition and pro-government forces.

For the week, the Stoxx 600 index fell 2.8%.

U.S. stocks rallied as fears of increased violence in Libya scaled back, currency interventions helped relieve pressure on Japan's economy and a handful of U.S. companies raised their dividends. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 118 points, or 1%, to 11892, on track to post its fourth day of triple-digit moves. 

In London,  TUI Travel  jumped 3.4%, getting a boost from falling oil prices. Electric grid operator  National Grid rose 4.4% after regulators issued a new revenue framework for the utilities sector that analysts said was regarded as less onerous than a previous draft.

The gains helped the FTSE 100 index, which rose 0.4% to 5718.13.

In Paris, the CAC 40 index added 0.6% to 3810.22, led by a 3.2% rally for Schneider Electric as the company's shares continued to recover from heavy recent selling.

UBS said Thursday that Schneider was among stocks that had been "unjustifiably oversold" following the Japanese earthquake, as only 1% of euro-zone exports go to Japan. Schneider's gains on Friday came on top of a 4.2% rise on Thursday.

In the utility sector, Electricite de France fell 1.7% in Paris and  E.On  slipped 1.6% in Frankfurt, as investors questioned how European energy policy will be affected by the events in Japan.

In Tokyo, the Nikkei Stock Average rallied 2.7% to 9206.75 after the Group of Seven countries intervened jointly in currency markets to halt the rising Japanese yen.

"The key question now is whether the unfolding risk appetite in foreign exchange resulting from intervention will translate into a sustainable bounce in equities," said  Ashraf Laidi, chief market strategist at CMC Markets.

  Bernard McAlinden, strategist at NCB Stockbrokers, said there was cautious optimism that the situation at Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant can be brought under control. Strong economic data from the U.S. on Thursday was a further driver for the market, he said.

"What's given the market solace is that these events in their own right aren't enough to halt growth," Mr. McAlinden said.

Currency markets saw some major moves as central banks intervened to stem the yen's recent strength. The euro was sharply higher against the dollar, trading at $1.4173 early afternoon in New York, up from $1.4022 late Thursday in New York, while sterling was at $1.6236 from $1.6139.

The dollar was fetching ¥80.96, up sharply from ¥78.95, though off an earlier high of ¥82. 

In economic news, the euro-zone trade balance deteriorated in January and was much worse than expected. However, given the yen intervention and events in Libya, the data were largely sidelined. 

Among commodities, the most actively traded contract, for April delivery, was up 1%, or $14.10, at $1,418.30 per troy ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. The thinly traded March-delivery contract was up 1.1%, or $14.90, at $1,418.90 per troy ounce.

Light, sweet crude for April delivery was recently up a penny at $101.43 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. May Brent crude on the ICE futures exchange was down 30 cents, or 0.3%, at $114.60 a barrel.
