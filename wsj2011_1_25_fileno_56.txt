LT Burger offers a warm respite from the frigid and deserted streets of the Hamptons in the winter. The Sag Harbor restaurant, which opened about six months ago and features a fireplace and café, sells photo-ready burgers as well as imaginative milkshakes.

"We try to make the best looking burger," said co-owner Laurent Tourondel, a Manhattan chef and restaurateur who intended to create a place for casual, family-friendly dining.



Burgers are piled high with a selection of choice toppings like bacon, BBQ onion and avocado. But the highlight is the mecox cheddar cheeseburger, made with local cheese, caramelized onions and mushrooms. For sides, there are the crisp, golden-brown onion rings and fried dill pickles, technically a starter but also the most popular menu item beyond the burgers.

When it comes to shakes, there are plenty of options. A favorite is the American Puff made with vanilla ice cream, cocoa puffs and Reeses peanut butter cups. For a little edge, there's the restaurant's selection of "Rated R" shakes, including the Daisy Dukes spiked with whisky.

Round out the meal with the restaurant's own brand of coffee, which is brewed on site, or the locally baked cupcakes.

 LT Burger, at 62 Main St. in Sag Harbor, is open 11:45 a.m. to 10 p.m. Sunday to Thursday and until 10:30 p.m. Friday and Saturday; 631-899-4646.
