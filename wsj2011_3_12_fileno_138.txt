State-run Oil & Natural Gas Corp. said Thursday that it expects a panel of ministers to discuss next week a proposal of Cairn Energy to sell a controlling stake in its Indian unit to London-listed miner Vedanta Resources PLC.

"A decision should possibly come soon," A. K. Hazarika, chairman of ONGC, told CNBC-TV18 television channel. "Payment of cess and royalty is the main issue. My personal view is that royalty is cost recoverable. On this, there should not be any issue."

On Aug. 16, Vedanta proposed buying 51%-60% of Cairn India Ltd. for about $8.5 billion to $9.6 billion in cash, but the deal has been delayed due to a lack of government and regulatory approvals in India.

Vedanta had said it will buy at least 40%, or as much as 51%, of Cairn India from Cairn Energy. Vedanta's unit Sesa Goa Ltd. will make an open offer at 355 rupees a share to Cairn India shareholders to buy up to 20% in the Indian explorer. Cairn Energy owns a 62.36% stake in Cairn India.

Cairn India's key producing asset is the north-western Rajasthan field, in which it holds 70% and ONGC holds the remaining 30%. But ONGC has to pay the entire royalty on crude oil produced from the block as a part of an earlier government program to give incentives to attract investment in the sector.

ONGC wanted Cairn to agree for an even payment of royalty before giving a green signal to the deal.
