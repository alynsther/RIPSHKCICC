The gourmet, Asian-inspired hotdogs at Brooklyn Flea have found a brick-and-mortar home. Asiadog looks sparse on the outside, but indoors the chicken, veggie and beef dogs with eight diverse toppings will fill you up.



Are you befuddled by the menu? Co-owner Melanie Campbell says employees are trained to help customers find their perfect pairing. 

Perhaps the popular "Sidney," a Thai-style topping with mango, cilantro and crushed peanuts, will sit atop your chicken dog. (Get extra napkins for this one.) There's also the "Ginny," made of kimchi and seaweed flakes. Go more traditional with the "Mash": ketchup, mustard and potato chips ($4.50 each or two for $8). Organic beef costs $5.50 each or two for $10. Choose whole wheat or white buns. 

The iced barley tea ($3) is a crisp, palette-cleanser between dogs. The crunchy yam fries ($3) and smooth wasabi potato salad ($3) are worth sampling. 

Asiadog boasts only seven seats, so anticipate takeout. "Whenever there's a seat," Ms. Campbell says. "People are snatching them."

 Asiadog, 66 Kenmare St., between Mott and Mulberry streets, is open 11 a.m. to 11 p.m; 212-226-8861.
