HONG KONGâ€”A record 140,000 new companies were registered here last year, a 28% increase over 2009 that underscores the city's vibrant recovery from the global recession.

The sharp increase partly reflects the overall strengthening of Hong Kong's economy, which grew 6.8% in the third quarter of 2010 compared with 2009. Hong Kong's gross domestic product shrank 2.6% in 2009 as global markets ground to a standstill from the financial crisis. Finance and real estate are big drivers for Hong Kong's economy.

The total number of local companies was a record 863,762, according to figures released Thursday by the Registrar of Companies. The number of foreign companies registered increased 8% to 8,165.

Some of the increase comes from companies set up for the purpose of investing in Hong Kong's booming real-estate market, where prices rose 15% in the nine months through September after a 30% jump in 2009, prompting concern from the International Monetary Fund of a potential property bubble.

The Hong Kong government has recently taken steps to cool home prices and has raised concerns about increasing inflation.
