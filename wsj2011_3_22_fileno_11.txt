In the heart of the Midtown meat-and-potatoes district, Sprig brings a Northern California flair to the neighborhood staple, along with an array of fresh soups, sandwiches, salads and pastas for those seeking lighter fare.

Sprig not only brings Northern California flair to Midtown's staple of meat and potatoes, but it also offers seasonal dishes and petite sandwiches for those seeking a lighter lunch.

"It is basically a mesh of New Americana and Mediterranean" with a focus on fresh ingredients from California and New York farms, said Executive Chef John Parlatore. 

By far the most popular item on the menu is the Lobster & Wild Mushroom Pasta ($22). 

If you have 30 minutes, go for the burgers made out of ground short rib blend with shoestring sweet potato fries ($16). The Nappa burger and a Tomato Fondue appetizer, $12, both come with Humbolt Fog Goat Cheese from California—volcanic ash is used in the separation process, giving it a smoky flavor.

Time-constrained diners can get a quick "market" meal that includes soup and a choice of two petite sandwiches, for $14. Lunches range from $10 for salads to $32 for a rack of lamb. Reservations are recommended during the peak lunch hour, which begins at 12:30 p.m.
