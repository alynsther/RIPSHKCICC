This week, Mayor Bloomberg hosted his annual Conservancy Benefit at Gracie Mansion to raise money for the landmark. It featured plenty of star chefs and 200 diners that collectively signed $900,000 in checks. 

"It's mostly people that I don't know but who are interested in the Mansion," explained the Mayor. 

While the mayor schmoozed, the event's heads Stanley and  Fiona Druckenmiller and George and  Nancy Walker inspired much of the donations. 

"There's a drawing on the wall from 1774, there are beautiful gardens planted by high school seniors in the back, and yet we're allowed to have a lovely dinner here," noted Ms. Druckenmiller whose husband, Stanley, is the president and CEO of Duquesne Capital.

"We're having huge real estate envy," said Mr. Walker. 

As for the food, Todd English provided the fresh prosciutto, Nobu delivered the sushi,  Locanda Verde took care of desserts, Ed's Lobster Bar offered the lobster rolls and  John DeLucie hawked his macaroni and cheese. 

Before the event, Mr. DeLucie had invited the mayor to his West Village restaurant, The Lion. The summons was swiftly accepted. "He seemed to smile a lot when the dishes came out," said Mr. DeLucie. "But we tried to leave him alone." 

"Food there is very good," the mayor assured. "I had a hamburger. Don't ask me why but they had a lot of stuff mixed in the burger. I like my burgers, hot dogs, fried chicken and baked beans. All the simple stuff. That's why I think my waistline shows."
