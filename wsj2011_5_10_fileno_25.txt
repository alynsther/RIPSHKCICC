BRUSSELSâ€”The European Union's sanctions on Syrian officials took effect Tuesday after the 27-nation bloc published the list of 13 individuals who will be hit by the travel ban, asset freeze and arms embargo. 

Despite the rising death toll from weeks of unrest, people across Syria continue to protest the government of President Bashar al-Assad. See events by day.

Among the 13 officials targeted was Maher al-Assad, the brother of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and commander of the army's 4th division, and Syria's intelligence chief Ali Mamlouk. 

Also targeted are Syria's Interior Minister Mohammed Ibrahim al-Chaar, and a Syrian businessman who the EU says "bankrolls" the regime, Rami Makhlouf. 

The head of political security, Mohammed Dib Zeitoun, the head of Syrian Military intelligence Abd Al-Fatah Qudsiyah and Air Force intelligence chief Jamil Hassan, as well as several former officials, are also targeted. 

The EU said Monday it would place the sanctions on an initial list of 13 people directly implicated in what it has called the regime's "violent repression" of demonstrators. 

However, the 27-nation bloc has also said it will extend the sanctions against other members of Syria's leadership if the regime does not change course.
