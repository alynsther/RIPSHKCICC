Your first hours with the Nintendo 3DS, the new 3-D portable gaming system (no funky headgear necessary) will be spent attacking disembodied heads floating in your living room and pelting dragons that have spawned from your coffee table. These built-in 3-D augmented reality games (that's where digital images are superimposed in real time over live environments) are futuristic and trippy, but if inadvertently knocking over vases to defeat villains isn't your thing, it's worth picking up games with more traditional 3-D treatments like "Lego Star Wars III"—funny how mesmerizing lasers flying out from a diminutive screen can be. Or "Super Street Fighter IV 3D," where the 3-D-ness enhances the slick graphical renderings of the now almost quaint, über-muscled characters. And "Pilotwings," a game where you glide across aerial obstacle courses, is as vertigo-inducing as the best scenes in "Up." Not sure if dizziness was the intended effect in these games, but hey, a small dose of spaciness in your day can't be all that bad. $250, nintendo.com
