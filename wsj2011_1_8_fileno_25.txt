NEW YORK—Stocks ended the first week of 2011 with a gain despite being slowed by a disappointing jobs report and renewed worries foreclosure worries for banks.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 22.55 points, or 0.19%, to 11674.76 Friday. But the measure rose 0.84% for the week, its sixth consecutive week in the black. Historically, the Dow has risen on the year 74% of the time that it was up in the first week. 

Much of the week's gains were made on Monday and Wednesday, with Monday's rally coming on optimism for the new year while Wednesday's climb followed a stronger-than-expected report on private-sector jobs for December. 

"We obviously had a strong end to 2010 and it just carried over," said  Bill Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Wealth Management. "And we've had a lot of good economic data," he said, though noting Friday's job report—which included a smaller-than-expected increase in December nonfarm payrolls—was seen as an exception.

The S&P 500 rose 1.10% on the week. The technology sector was the best-performing category in the S&P 500 for the week, with a gain of 2.7%, while financials were also strong despite their drop on Friday. The weakest sectors, meanwhile, included consumer staples and telecommunications. 

The sector trends show investors began 2011 in favor of more economically sensitive stocks, Mr. Stone said. 

"Some of the continuing strength in the global economic environment is certainly a boon to the tech sector, and the tech sector underperformed in 2010," Mr. Stone noted. "You could say the same thing about financials."
