LONDON â€” The sale of Stanlow refinery to  Essar Energy PLC is expected to be concluded this month, said Essar Chief Executive Officer  Naresh Nayyar on Monday. 

 "Shell has largely concluded consultation with employees," he said. "We expect to sign the agreement in the next week to 10 days. Thereafter the closing process will start and we expect to take ownership of the refinery in the second half of this year."

 Shell agreed last month to sell Stanlow, the U.K.'s second-largest refinery, to Essar for $350 million. Including crude and refined product inventories, total consideration of the deal is expected to be between $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion. 

 Mr. Nayyar said that Essar would look to expand Stanlow's capacity when it takes control of the facility. 

 "The refinery currently has a capacity of 14 million (metric) tons but is running at 75% of capacity," he said. "We are looking at various options for improvement both in terms of capacity utilization and to change its crude slate." 

 He added that this process was still in its early stages.
