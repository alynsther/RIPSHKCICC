Fears over unrest in Egypt sent U.S. stocks reeling to the biggest one-day decline in months and put an end to the market's eight-week win streak, as investors sought safety while oil prices surged. 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 166.13 points, or 1.4%, to 11823.70, the largest one-day drop since Nov. 16, 2010. The slump pushed the Dow's week-to-date performance into the red, erasing a weekly advance it had recorded coming into Friday's session. The Dow ended the week down 0.4%, the first weekly decline in nine weeks. 

The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 23.20, or 1.8%, to 1276.34, the biggest one-day decline since Aug. 11, 2010. It fell 0.6% on the week.

The Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled 68.39, or 2.5%, to 2686.89, the biggest one-day drop since Aug. 11, 2010. It ended the week down 0.1%. Nasdaq OMX Group restored the measure following dissemination issues earlier in the session.

The declines came as Egypt's ruling regime faced its biggest challenge Friday, the fourth consecutive day of street protests. President Hosni Mubarak declared a curfew in riot-wracked Egyptian cities and ordered the country's government to step down late Friday after army tanks began to enter streets to beat back protesters that took to the streets en masse.

Crude-oil prices surged $3.70, or 4.3%, to $89.34. 

"That's the most immediate concern, what's happening in Egypt and how that might affect oil prices if the Suez Canal gets closed, which is a real possibility," said  Ed Cowart, lead manager of Eagle Asset Management's Large Cap Value and All Cap Value and Equity Income Strategies. He noted if the canal is closed, it could add substantially to the travel time for oil to get from the Middle East to the West. 

Shares of tankers and shippers climbed as investors bet on a shutdown of the Suez Canal. Frontline jumped $1.94, or 7.7%, to $27.12,  Overseas Shipholding leapt 1.95, or 6%, to 34.40, and General Maritime advanced 30 cents, or 10%, to 3.22.

 fell 1.49, or 1.3%, to 114.84 as analysts at Houston energy research firm Tudor Pickering Holt noted that the oil-and-gas explorer and producer gets about 25% of its production and cash flow from its business in Egypt.

The stock market's "fear gauge" leapt to the highest point in nearly two months. The Chicago Board Options Exchange Market Volatility Index, or VIX, touched an intraday high of 19.86, a level not seen since Dec. 2. 

Investors flocked to the safety of the U.S. dollar and Treasurys. The U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the U.S. currency against a basket of six others, climbed 0.5%. Advances in Treasurys pushed the yield on the 10-year note down to 3.33%, as prices and yields move inversely. Gold also climbed.

"It's huge, it's a revolution going on in front of our eyes," said  Nick Raich, director of research and senior vice president, Key Private Bank. "Many of these corporations that make up the S&P 500 don't do much of any business in Egypt, but what does it do to oil prices and commodity prices? If there's a spike, it could raise costs."

  Paul Zemsky, head of asset allocation at ING Investment Management, noted that the concerns about Egypt followed a long rally that had many investors feeling the market was getting toppy. "Egypt was the catalyst in an overbought market," Mr. Zemsky said. "It got people nervous on a Friday afternoon." 

In the U.S., data showed gross domestic product, the broadest measure of an economy's size, rose at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of 3.2% in the fourth quarter. Consumer spending, accounting for about 70% of demand in the U.S. economy, rose at a 4.4% rate in the fourth quarter. 

Still, the GDP reading was below the 3.5% expansion economists expected.
