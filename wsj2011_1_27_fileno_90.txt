The Knicks will catch at least one break on Thursday night when they take on the Miami Heat at 8 p.m. at Madison Square Garden. Forward Chris Bosh won't play because of a sprained left ankle. Mr. Bosh is averaging 18 points and eight rebounds this season. However, the other two Miami stars, LeBron James and Dwyane Wade, will suit up.

Mets ace Johan Santana, who is rehabbing from shoulder surgery, has yet to begin throwing, general manager Sandy Alderson said. Mr. Santana has been cleared by doctors to start throwing when he deems himself ready, but Mr. Alderson said that hasn't happened yet. He is projected to return between June and the All-Star break, but Mr. Alderson said, "I wouldn't try to kid you that any of us can accurately predict" when Mr. Santana will be back.

The debate has raged for two years: Why not make Joba Chamberlain a starter? Yankee brass have traditionally answered with flat statements that his arsenal plays better in the bullpen—but now general manager Brian Cashman is finally explaining why. 

The team believes that Mr. Chamberlain was permanently damaged by an August 2008 shoulder injury suffered in Texas, Mr. Cashman said.

"He can start, but it's just the stuff's not the same as it used to be. I think it goes back to the Texas shoulder episode," Mr Cashman said. 

"Prior to that episode in Texas, he threw up to 95, almost 100, out of the rotation and bullpen. Now he throws that mostly out of the bullpen— but not out of the rotation. His starting days are done, as far as I'm concerned," Mr. Cashman said.
