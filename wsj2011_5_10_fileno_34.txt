NEW DELHI --  Tata Motors Ltd.'s U.K.-based unit Jaguar Land Rover may face supply disruptions due to the recent earthquake and tsunami in Japan which forced most automobile and auto parts makers there to shut factories temporarily.

But there have been no production shutdowns or delays due to supply problems so far, Tata Motors said in a disclosure to the U.S.' Securities and Exchange Commission Monday.

Tata Motors, India's biggest auto maker by revenue, added that it is monitoring the impact of the disaster in Japan.

It wasn't clear which parts and materials Jaguar Land Rover sources from Japan.

A magnitude 9.0 quake struck Japan in March, which also triggered a tsunami, forcing a halt in production at all car makers in the country and creating shortages of parts from suppliers in quake-stricken areas.

 in April said its plants in Japan will remain at 50% of their pre-quake production plan until the end of June, and output levels after July are uncertain.

The car maker said it expects its production at home to return to its initially planned level by the end of the year.  Toyota Motor Corp. had also said that output at its Japanese factories won't be back to normal until at least November.
