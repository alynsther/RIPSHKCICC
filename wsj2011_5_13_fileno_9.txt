Grilled-cheese lunches don't have to end after elementary school.



Instead take your guilty pleasure to The Melt Shop in Midtown East. Step down into the Atrium area and head toward the bright yellow awning where about 100 seats await. "It's nice that you can get away down there and be out of the hustle and bustle," says Andrew Moger, a partner.

The poster-size menu will help you order, but decide fast because the line moves fast. 

The beef 'n' blue sandwich ($8.95) of roast beef, blue cheese, caramelized onions and horseradish mayo is delicious and filling, but with so many ingredients it's hard to keep it all together. (Get extra napkins for this one.) 

The fontina and goat cheese sandwich ($7.50) melts in your mouth and is flavorful with roasted wild mushrooms and parsley pesto. If you simply crave cheese, the three-cheese melt of gruyere, fontina and goat cheese with roasted tomatoes ($7.75) is tasty, or opt for the classic, American cheese on white bread, for $4.99. 

Don't skip the shop tots ($2.95) with a smoky sauce.
