BRASILIA -- President Obama said Saturday that he had authorized "limited military action in Libya" and reported, "That action has begun."

He said the U.S. will contribute its "unique capabilities at the front end," a reference to U.S. cruise missiles that are aimed at Libyan air defenses.

Speaking from Brasilia, Brazil, where he began a five-day Latin America swing, Mr. Obama said the use of force was not his first choice and "not a choice I make lightly."

"In this effort, the United States is acting with a broad coalition" that is committed to enforcing the U.N. Security Council resolution that called for protecting the Libyan people.

He said he consulted his international security team and the bipartisan leadership of Congress before acting. He promised to "keep the American people fully informed."

The president reiterated that the U.S. will not send in ground troops.

"Today I authorized the armed forces of the United States to begin a limited military action in Libya," he began. "That action has now begun."

Obama said he had given Moammar Gadhafi the chance to avoid this outcome. "Despite the hollow words of his government, he has ignored that opportunity," Obama said.

"His attacks on his own people have continued, his forces have been on the move and the danger faced by the people of Libya has grown," he told reporters.

"We must be clear, actions have consequences and the writ of the international community must be enforced," he said.

He emphasized the international support for the action and said he was proud the U.S. was acting as part of a coalition that included "partners who are prepared to meet their responsibilities."

"Make no mistake: today we are part of a broad coalition," he said, a contrast to the Iraq invasion that was opposed by many allies and by Mr. Obama himself. "We are acting in the interest of the United States and the world."
