Butler's improbable run to the Sweet 16 has naturally drawn comparisons to last season, when the school was one bounce off the rim away from becoming the most unlikely national champion. But if history serves as an indication, Bulldog fans shouldn't expect another march to the Final Four. 

Butler has barely squeaked into the Sweet 16, which is a very bad tournament omen. First, it edged Old Dominion, 60-58, on a buzzer-beating tip-in, then stunned top-seeded Pittsburgh, 71-70, in perhaps the wildest game of the tournament so far. Before this year, only six teams had advanced beyond the Round of 32 by winning their first two games by two points or fewer (since the tournament expanded to 64 schools in 1985). Five of those six teams lost in the Sweet 16. Arkansas, the national runner-up in 1995, is the lone exception. 

It turns out Butler isn't the only team that should be worried about its chances for this reason. Arizona, the fifth-seed in the West bracket, also meets these criteria—the Wildcats outlasted Memphis by two in the Round of 64 and snuck past Texas by one in the Round of 32. 

Adjusting the parameters confirms that surviving close tournament games is a harbinger of doom. Of the 14 teams that won their first two tournament contests by three points or fewer, only two made the Final Four: Arkansas and last season's Michigan State's squad, which lost to Butler in the semifinals.
