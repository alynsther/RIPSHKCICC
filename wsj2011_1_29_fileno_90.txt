We shroud our iPhones in cases mainly to protect them from the inevitable clumsy drops. But if you've ever been in a meeting where everyone's placed their monolithic slabs on the table then you know another good reason for a distinctive case: to give your phone some personality. (And, of course, to ensure you don't accidentally walk off with your boss's phone.) 

Brightly colored, yet tastefully so, the Lego-like modular panels of the Case-mate Stacks and Quartet for the iPhone 4 can be rearranged and swapped out for different hues to create a custom look. It lets you reinvent yourself. Not as much as Lady Gaga, but, you know, enough. $35, case-mate.com
