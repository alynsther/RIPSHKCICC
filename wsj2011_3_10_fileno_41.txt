Not everyone in the Ohio State community is satisfied with the school's punishment of coach Jim Tressel. A column in the Lantern, the OSU student newspaper, called for Tressel's firing after the revelation that the coach failed to disclose possible rules infractions by Buckeye players. On Tuesday, Ohio State suspended Tressel for the first two games of the 2011 season and fined him $250,000, but officials said his job wasn't in jeopardy.

 The radio calls of Sandy Koufax's first no-hitter in 1962 and Jim Brown's 1957 Cotton Bowl performance will enter the Library of Congress as part of a landmark audio archive acquired from John Miley of Evansville, Ind. Miley, who as a high school student recorded parts of the 1947 World Series onto metal wire, has collected about 6,000 sports recordings from 1920 to 1972.
