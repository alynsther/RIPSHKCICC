MUMBAIâ€”Indian shares snapped a four-day positive run to close lower Tuesday, as fears of a rise in interest rates sparked a selloff in banking shares. 

The Bombay Stock Exchange's Sensitive Index fell 62.33 points, or 0.3%, to close at 20498.72 after moving between 20449.01 and 20,65121. On the National Stock Exchange, the 50-stock S&P CNX Nifty shed 11.25 points, or 0.2%, to end at 6,146.35. 

  Volatility Only Constant for Indian Banks  

Trading volume on the BSE climbed to 43.3 billion rupees from Monday's 27 billion rupees. Gainers lagged decliners 1,415 to 1,476, while 158 stocks were unchanged. Among the Sensex's 30 constituents, 18 finished lower. 

"Auto and banking stocks were out of favor and we saw funds flow into resources stocks such as Reliance Industries and consumer goods on defensive buying," says  Jagdish Malkani, country head at TAIB Capital. 

An analyst with a local brokerage who declined to be identified expects markets to rise in the first half of January on hopes that foreign institutions would allocate more funds for emerging markets. 

Banking shares closed sharply lower as investors anticipated that the Reserve Bank of India would increase policy rates to combat high inflation in its Jan. 25 policy review. 

In addition, fears of weak October-December earnings for banks were exacerbated by a sharp slide in government bond prices, pushing up yields. That could mean treasury losses at banks, said another analyst with a local brokerage. 

"In any case, interest margins for banks are expected to shrink by 0.25 percentage point to 0.50 percentage point in the third quarter due to higher deposit costs," said the analyst, who also declined to be identified. 

Losses were led by ICICI Bank, which fell 3.5% to 1,104.1 rupees, while State Bank of India closed 3.1% lower at 2,733.6 rupees

Auto stocks saw a bout of profit-taking following gains made Monday on the back of strong December sales. 

Tata Motors fell 0.5% to 1,300.5 rupees while Hero Honda Motors closed 0.5% lower at 1,975.2 rupees. Bajaj Auto, which was one of the few auto makers to report disappointing December sales, extended Monday's losses to close 3.1% lower at 1,430.55 rupees. 

Among Sensex gainers, Reliance Industries rose on expectations the government will allow the company to raise prices of gas from its KG-D6 field. India's largest company by market value added 2.1% to close at 1,076.55 rupees. 

Consumer-goods shares gained from defensive buying as investors moved funds from auto and banking stocks. Hindustan Unilever rose 2.5% to 321.05 rupees while ITC closed 1.8% higher at 177.45 rupees.
