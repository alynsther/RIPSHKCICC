However obsolete they may seem, some radios are beautiful enough to keep on the shelf even if you never turn them on. Such is the case with the Brionvega ts522, a semiportable, cubey delight designed by Richard Sapper and Marco Zanussi in 1964. When closed, its retractable chrome handle, rounded edges and boxy, log-like outline make it look like a lunchbox swiped off the set of a Fellini movie. (It can run on batteries.) Opening it up reveals a retro-futuristic set of controls that involves turning old-school dials and watching LED lights roam over bandwidth dials to tune in a station (the lights are a new-millennium replacement for the original radio dial's printed numbers). The single, "HD" speaker won't win any audio awards, but if you just tune in and pretend you're hanging out with Sophia Loren and Clark Gable on Capri, you won't care.
