KIEV, Ukraineâ€”Ukraine's former President Leonid Kuchma vowed Wednesday to disprove accusations of involvement in the murder of an investigative journalist more than 10 years ago.

Arriving for questioning at the general prosecutor's office, Mr. Kuchma said he was ready to endure "all the torments of hell" to demonstrate his innocence in the most high-profile crime in post-Soviet Ukraine.

Prosecutors announced Tuesday that they were investigating whether the 72-year-old Mr. Kuchma, who governed Ukraine from 1994 to 2005, had abused his power by giving an order to police officials that led to the slaying of Georgy Gongadze. The journalist disappeared in September 2000. His headless body was found in woodland outside Kiev.

Critics of the Ukrainian leader began demanding at the time that he be investigated in the case after a tape recording was released by an opposition politician in which a voice that sounds like Mr. Kuchma's ordered officials to "deal with" Mr. Gongadze.

Prosecutors said Tuesday they would for the first time accept the tapes, which have never been conclusively authenticated, as evidence.
