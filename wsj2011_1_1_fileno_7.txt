HONOLULUâ€”President Barack Obama is starting the new year with a tone of bipartisanship as he braces for what will likely be a more hostile Congress in 2011. 

Mr. Obama, speaking at the dawn of 2011 while vacationing in Hawaii with his family, said he sees signs that the economy is gaining traction and reiterated his willingness to accept ideas from anyone, including Republicans, to help the economy pick up speed. 

In his weekly radio address to the nation, Mr. Obama said "At the start of 2011, we're still just emerging from a once-in-a-lifetime recession that's taken a terrible toll on millions of families." 

He wished the nation a Happy New Year and said his New Year's resolution is to do everything within his power to create jobs and grow the economy. 

Mr. Obama has surveyed the coming political environment and said he knows both parties "have a shared responsibility to move this country forward." He added, "Here's what I want you to know: I'm willing to work with anyone of either party who's got a good idea and the commitment to see it through." 

It remains unclear whether the new year will bring more partisanship. The race for the 2012 presidential election is set to heat up, and some incoming Republicans won on anti-Obama policy platforms. 

The president said the nation faces serious challenges, from how to keep the U.S. competitive on the world stage to keeping the American dream alive. Other challenges include dealing with the country's ballooning deficit and complex tax code, which many agree needs to be revamped. 

Mr. Obama has said he wants to tackle the issues and has shown a willingness to reach across party lines. He said if the country can rise to solving its challenges, the U.S. will continue to be "the greatest country in the world."
