Beloved East Village restaurant Prune is among the most perennially packed restaurants in the city. During dinner and brunch it's elbow-to- elbow in the small dining room, but lunch time is fine for a lovely, casual meal. 

Dinner and brunch at Prune in the East Village may be packed elbow to elbow, but lunch proves to be a fine time for a lovely, casual meal.



Chef and owner Gabrielle Hamilton opened Prune in 1999. The restaurant's style is reflected by its dining-room music: American and a little homespun (Dolly Parton), witty and edgy (Morrissey) and classic and soulful (Diana Ross). 

The short bistro-style menu changes with the season but always includes salads and a soup, a hamburger, a sandwich and an egg dish. Recent dishes included a perfectly cooked skate wing with a lemon caper sauce served with a fennel salad, and a terrific side dish of shaved Tuscan kale with olive oil and Parmesan cheese. There are wines by the glass and dessert options include a rich, tiny chocolate pot de cr√®me. The average lunch check is $20 and service is courteous.

 Prune, 54 E. First St. in Manhattan, 212-677-6221, serves lunch weekdays from 11:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.
