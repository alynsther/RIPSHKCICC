MUMBAI -- The Mahindra Group has acquired a minority stake in luxury brand The East India Co., both companies said Monday. 

The joint statement didn't give details of the deal. 

London-based The East India Co. was established in 1600 to trade in commodities such as silk, cotton and tea, and was responsible for a large chunk of global trade for more than two centuries. It was re-launched last year, as a luxury brand selling high-end food products. 

The East India Co. plans to invest $100 million over the next five years, expanding into markets in Asia and the Middle East, it said in the statement. 

The Mahindra group owns Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd., India's biggest sport-utility vehicle maker by sales, and outsourcing company Tech Mahindra Ltd.
