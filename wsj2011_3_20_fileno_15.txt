Some families of U.S. military members stationed in Japan have been told they can't take pets with them on government-departure flights, but a U.S. Navy representative on Saturday said up to two pets were allowed on board per family. 

An animal rights group, the Animal Legal Defense Fund, said on Friday concerns had been raised to it by several family members of active U.S. military units stationed in Japan that they were being told they could not bring pets. On Saturday, U.S. Navy Lt. Theresa Donnelly in an email pointed to military policy current as of Saturday saying dependants could bring up to two pets on flights. Horses, fish, birds, and rodents were not allowed, she said in the email.

Lt. Donnelly said a government-departure plane from Japan landed in Seattle on Saturday afternoon with 233 people and nine dogs on board. 

Stacey Hunter, whose husband is a computer specialist in the U.S. Army at Camp Zama, about 35 miles southwest of Tokyo, said on Friday that at several "town hall" meetings sponsored by the military in recent days, dependents of military members were told they were allowed to depart on government flights because of radiation risks but that pets could not come along. 

"A big issue has arisen making many hesitant to leave," Ms. Hunter wrote in an email to the Animal Legal Defense Fund seeking help. 

In a phone interview, Ms. Hunter said her nine-year-old daughter, Dakotah, approached a military commander at one of the town hall meetings and told him she would leave behind her luggage if she could take her dogs in its stead. 

Lt. Donnelly said the policy applied to all branches of the U.S. military in Japan. She did not know specifics about Ms. Hunter's situation in Camp Zama but that the policy applied to any dependents of military members stationed there.
