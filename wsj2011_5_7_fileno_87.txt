When Col. Meriwether Lewis Clark Jr. (grandson of the explorer) held the first Kentucky Derby in 1875, he modeled it after the European races, expecting attendees to dress for the occasion. Although there have been interesting interpretations of Mr. Clark's dress code since then—last year, for example, figure skater Johnny Weir wore a black wide-brimmed sun hat with plumage and a fitted bouclé jacket—we suggest sticking to the basics: seersucker for guys, and an airy garden-print dress and hat for ladies. But no matter if you go for a classic look or break away from the pack, the most important decision of the day is betting on a winner.
