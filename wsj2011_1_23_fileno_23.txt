Smartphone apps can help you find gas stations with the best prices.

The GasBuddy app uses GPS technology to find either the 100 gas stations closest to you or all stations within a 50-mile radius and then ranks them according to price. You can also search by city, state or ZIP Code.

The free app is available for the iPhone, Droid and Windows 7 phones; a version for the BlackBerry comes out next month.

GasBuddy relies on its 1.5 million registered users to post the prices they see. To ensure reliability, it compares user postings to credit-card transaction information and a station's past pricing strategy, says  Jason Toews, co-founder of GasBuddy. All prices are updated within 48 hours and many are updated within 10 hours, he says.

A recent search on GasBuddy for Knoxville, Tenn., found a station selling unleaded regular gas for $2.83 a gallon two miles down the highway from one selling it for $3.06.

Searches also can be done at GasBuddy.com. The app and website also tell you if a gas station has restrooms, a convenience store, air hose and ATM.

With iGasUp, an app for the iPhone, you can find the 10 cheapest stations within a radius of your choosing, though it won't include every station in the area. This app, which costs $2.99 per year, relies on credit-card transaction information for prices that are updated within three days.
