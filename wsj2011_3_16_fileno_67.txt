Here are the teams in this year's tournament that have done the most—and the least— to justify their seeds since 1985 (min. 5 games), based on their expected point differential.*

Every year, the announcement of teams for the NCAA men's basketball tournament sparks widespread debate about which schools receive too much or too little credit from the selection committee.

 For four straight years, The Wall Street Journal has been gathering data to determine whether the committee tends to favor, or give a higher seed than deserved, to some teams while short-changing others. 

We recorded the scores for every tournament game since 1985, the year the NCAA expanded the field to 64 teams, to calculate how close each game should be based on the seeds of the two teams playing. For example, a 5-seed beats a 12-seed by an average of 4.75 points. Using this metric, it's clear some teams consistently outperform the averages while others tend to underperform. 

Among the schools guaranteed a spot in the second round, no team has done less to justify its seeds over the years than BYU, which needed two overtime periods to escape last year's first-round matchup against a lower-seeded opponent. Right behind the Cougars among the underachievers are Florida State and San Diego State, both of which were bounced in the first round last year.

On the other end, West Virginia fans can claim their team gets a raw deal. The Mountaineers, which advanced to the Final Four last year as a 2-seed, outperform their seed by an average of 4.7 points.
