Indianapolis Colts quarterback Peyton Manning not only dashed the Jets' postseason dreams last January, he also provided the league with a blueprint for how to counterattack Rex Ryan's frequent blitzing.

In 2009, the Jets smothered opposing passing games with their blitzing schemes, holding opposing quarterbacks to 50.3 and 49.4 QB ratings respectively when sending five and six-plus rushers (instead of the conventional four or fewer).

Then along came Mr. Manning in the AFC Championship Game. He threw for 187 yards on 14 attempts (137.5 QB rating) against one extra rusher and for 82 yards on 10 attempts (127.9 rating) when Mr. Ryan attacked him with two or more blitzers. The league average QB rating on all passes since 2009 is 81.7.

But since that game, the Jets' pass defense has dramatically declined despite adding former Pro Bowl cornerback Antonio Cromartie via trade and rarely-used Kyle Wilson in the first round of last year's NFL draft. The major culprit in this decline appears to be Mr. Ryan's beloved blitz. This year, when the Jets rushed five, opposing QBs improved to near average in their rating. And when Mr. Ryan is most aggressive dialing up blitzes (six or more rushers), opposing QBs posted a scintillating 98.6 QB rating this season. That's higher than the career rating mark of every QB in league history.

In fact, the Jets have performed best versus the pass this season when opting for the more conservative approach—71.7 QB rating allowed when not blitzing versus 84.8 when they do. Perhaps the recipe for revenge against Mr. Manning is bluffing the blitz, as its mere threat clearly seems to be more effective than its actuality.
