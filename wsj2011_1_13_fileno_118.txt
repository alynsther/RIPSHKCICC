Without Serena Williams, the 2011 Australian Open is wide open. In recent times, Ms. Williams has dominated the tournament, winning four of the past six Grand Slams at Melbourne Park. But injury has ruled the world No. 2 out of this year's event, leaving the first major of the tennis season up for grabs.

Kim Clijsters and Justine Henin are among the leading contenders, with the Belgian pair best-priced at 9/4 with Bet365 and 6/1 with Boylesports and Bodog respectively. Ms. Clijsters hopes of winning here will have been raised by a solid run in this week's Sydney International, although she has won the warm-up tournament twice previously without clinching the Australian Open title.

Should Ms. Clijsters and Ms. Henin reach the final here, fans would witness a repeat of the 2004 final, when Ms. Henin won over three sets. That, along with two other final appearances here in 2006 and 2010, shows the pedigree of the former world No. 1 in this event and makes Ms. Henin a good each-way bet.

Caroline Wozniacki, the current world No. 1 is 15/2 with Victor Chandler and Coral, although some may consider those short odds given the Danish star has never won a major.

At 18/1 with Victor Chandler, Samantha Stosur represents a better bet: The Brisbane native is a crowd favorite and reached her first Grand Slam singles final at the age of 26 in the French Open last year. She was defeated by Serena Williams in the fourth round here last time and the sixth seed is worth considering each-way.
