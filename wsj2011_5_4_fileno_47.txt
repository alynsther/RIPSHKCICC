MUMBAI --Grasim Industries Ltd. has said it would indirectly get a 33.33% stake in Domsjo Fabriker AB after its board approved investing 2.8 billion rupees in the group holding company used to buy the Swedish pulp maker. 

Grasim said its investment in Aditya Holding AB will help fund the $340-million Domsjo acquisition. 

Grasim expects to fund the investment through internal accruals and complete the deal by the end of May. 

The Domsjo acquisition was the latest in a string of Birla group acquisitions, including a recent buyout of the chloro-chemicals unit of Kanoria Chemicals and Industries Ltd. 

Domsjo has a pulp capacity of 210,000 metric tons a year and plans to expand this to 255,000 tons a year by 2012, Grasim added.
