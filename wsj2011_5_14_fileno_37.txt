Motivated at least in part by the possibility of a new arena for the Islanders, forward Michael Grabner, who led all National Hockey League rookies last season with 34 goals, has signed a five-year contract extension with the team. The deal is worth $15 million, two people familiar with the negotiations confirmed. Grabner, 23, broke the news on his Twitter account. He wrote: "I am happy to announce that I will be an Islander for the next five years. New building, new contract and new baby. What a great year!!!!!"

Grabner's 34 goals led the Islanders, and his 52 points were the fourth-most on the team. He is one of three finalists for the Calder Trophy, given annually to the league's top rookie. The other two finalists are San Jose's Logan Couture and Carolina's Jeff Skinner.

Giants running back Charles Scott was involved in a car accident in Baton Rouge, La., on Wednesday, but the injuries he sustained were neither life-threatening nor career-threatening, according to his agent, Jon Perzley. 

Scott, who finished last season on the Giants' practice squad, was a passenger in the vehicle and did spend time in intensive care after the accident, but he was doing "a lot better" on Friday, Perzley said.

Pitcher Phil Hughes took the first steps down the road to recovery Friday afternoon, throwing for the first time since he was shut down with the suspicion of serious vascular problems. Hughes, who is suffering from a dead arm, is now on a simple rest-and-rehab program for the next two months. 

He threw 30 times at 50 feet Friday and will likely increase intensity and distance every day if there is progress, manager Joe Girardi said.
