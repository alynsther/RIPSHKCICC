  Stephen Wechsler and his wife, Ellen, are ready to part ways with their gallery-like co-opâ€”even if it means losing a small fortune on the transaction. 

They have listed the Upper East Side apartment for $3.3 million, even after spending roughly $2 million on renovations. The couple purchased the space, which measures some 2,500 square feet, in 2007 for $2.4 million, according to property records.



 "It was not in great condition," said Mr. Wechsler, who owns a life-insurance business. "There were a lot of extraneous walls that weren't needed."

A gut renovation resulted in a loft-like apartment with white porcelain floors, a new kitchen with white-glass countertops and the addition of 40 closets. They also replaced the windows with large panes, enlarged the master-suite bathroom and installed recessed lighting. 

"We didn't skimp on a thing," Mr. Wechsler said. "I realized that if I was willing to put enough money into the space, we could make it what we wanted."

The couple intended the space to look like a gallery to highlight their colorful artwork, which includes glassware, Swarovski crystals, sculptures and paintings.

There are pieces by  Jon Kuhn, Dale Chihuly and an  Allan Houser sculpture, which Mr. Wechsler says is the most valuable, worth at least $200,000.

The home has three bedrooms, one of which is used as a dressing room, and a wrap-around terrace that spans some 1,000 square feet.

The property was listed last November with A.C. Lawrence & Co., but the home has been on the market since February, according to agent  Steven Halpern. The couple initially asked for $3.65 million, but there have been a series of price reductions. 

"I woke up one day about a year ago and I said, enough, it's time to retire," said Mr. Wechsler, who plans to live full time in Florida, where the couple also own a home. "I'm going to lose over $1.5 million, but I want to simplify my life."
