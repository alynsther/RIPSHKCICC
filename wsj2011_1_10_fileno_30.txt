NEW DELHIâ€” India's minister for information and broadcasting,  Ambika Soni, said Monday that her ministry has accepted the broadcast regulator's proposal to increase the foreign direct investment limit in FM radio to 26% from the current 20%. 

The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, which regulates the telecommunications and media sectors, in June proposed to raise the limit of foreign direct investment in FM radio and in some broadcast carriage services, such as direct-to-home satellite distribution and Internet television. 

Increasing the limit will help bring much-needed funds to the FM radio business, which gets far less advertisements than the television and print media segments. 

The information and broadcasting ministry will now have to obtain the federal cabinet's clearance to amend the rules governing the segment. The changes will then need parliament's approval to become law. 

Minister Soni said a panel of ministers will make a decision in the next few days on the guidelines to auction licenses under the third phase of India's FM radio expansion plan. 

India has about 248 FM radio stations and is planning to allot 806 more FM licenses in the third phase. Companies such as HT Media Ltd., Entertainment Networks India Ltd., Sun TV Network Ltd. and Midday Multimedia Ltd. operate FM radio stations. 

Ms. Soni said her ministry will review the proposals of a panel set up last year to study the television audience measurement mechanism and suggest steps to put in place a transparent rating system. 

The panel submitted its report Monday. 

Currently, two private agencies offer television audience measurement data, on which advertisers base their television advertising decisions.
