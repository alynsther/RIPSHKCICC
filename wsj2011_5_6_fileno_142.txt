NEW DELHI –The Indian government Friday set the indicative price of Power Finance Corp.'s follow-on public offering in a range of 193 rupees ($4.3) – 203 rupees a share, Power Secretary P.  Uma Shankar told Dow Jones Newswires. 

The upper end of the band offers a discount of 5% to the company's closing share price of 214.55 rupees Friday. 

The offering of 229.55 million shares, which begins May 10 and closes May 13, could raise as much as 46.6 billion rupees ($1.04 billion) at the upper end of the range. 

The issue is part of the government's aim to raise 400 billion rupees from stake sales in state-run companies in the financial year that began April 1 to raise funds for social welfare and infrastructure projects and to reduce its fiscal deficit. Power Finance is the first company this fiscal year where the government is selling part of its stake. Last year, the government sold shares in six companies including Coal India Ltd. to raise 227.63 billion. 

The government--which holds 89.78% of Power Finance--will sell a 5% stake, or 57.39 million shares, while the company will sell new shares equal to 15% of its share capital, or 172.17 million shares. 

Power Finance will use the funds to boost its capital base to ensure compliance with capital adequacy rules and give loans to power projects. The lender is required to maintain a capital adequacy ratio of at least 15% of its risk-weighted assets. The ratio was 17.31% as of December 2010, according to its draft share sale prospectus. 

India's power sector will need an investment of $300 billion to $400 billion between 2012 and 1017 to build generation capacity and transmission infrastructure to meet growing demand for electricity, Uma Shankar said Thursday. 

The share sale comes at a time when stock markets are volatile and investors jittery on concerns about the Indian economy's growth prospects and high inflation. The Bombay Stock Exchange's benchmark Sensex is down nearly 10% so far in 2011 and has fallen nine of the past 10 trading sessions. Earlier Friday, Power Finance shares touched a one-year low of 210.05 rupees. 

Still, analysts are optimistic about the company. 

"Companies like Power Finance are well positioned to meet demand for funds," said Jagannadham Thunuguntla, head of research at SMC Capitals Ltd. "I recommend investors buy the stock with two to three years' perspective as the discount offered by the government will be a good opportunity to enter."
