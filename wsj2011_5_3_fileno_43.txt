When Sacramento Kings fans stayed in their seats after this season's last home game, they appeared to be saying goodbye to a team thought set to move to Anaheim. But while a bid for a new Sacramento arena has stalled, the NBA didn't approve an immediate move, and on Monday the Kings owners, the Maloof brothers, said they'd sit tight. The team did say the NBA will revisit the move if a new arena isn't finalized "in a timely fashion."

Shouldn't having a bunch of future NFL players be an advantage? The three schools with the most players taken in the weekend draft—USC (nine), North Carolina (nine) and Miami (Fla.) (eight)—all finished last season outside the AP top 25, while Clemson, Georgia and Iowa (six draftees apiece) went a combined 20-19. The school that got the most out of the least: title-game loser Oregon, which had only one player selected (Eagles fourth-round linebacker Casey Matthews).

It's no surprise that the Cleveland Indians have MLB's best record—they have a rabbit's foot playing second base.
