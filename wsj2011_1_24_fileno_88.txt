The Wooster Group's experimental revival of Tennessee William's "Vieux Carré" opens Feb. 2. We asked the director, Elizabeth LeCompte, 67, what her main influences were in the creative process, and to account for how much each contributed to the final production, represented by the graphic. 

For Ms. LeCompte, the assignment crystallized how her role differs from others in her theater collective. "We work so closely together that I lose myself in them," she said. "But my influences are not theirs. That was the most enlightening thing."

Her particular mix goes beyond the vast documentation of Williams's life and work and includes the art films of  Ryan Trecartin and Warhol collaborator  Paul Morrissey, as well as Chinese Opera, porn, travel to New Orleans and the Greek fertility God, Priapus, whose iconic feature was an oversize, and permanent, erection.

"There's so much sex in this piece compared to Williams's early work," she said. 

Many of her influences are quite distant from Williams's original text. "But it's not additive," she said. "You're exploring. The writing will say, 'The scene takes on a touch of bizarre.' But what's a touch of bizarre? You have to interpret that. You blow air into a balloon that hadn't been blown up."

In 1977, critics panned the original production of "Vieux Carré," which survived only 17 performances on Broadway. Evidently, Ms. LeCompte, more than three decades later, responded differently. "It called me," she said. "I saw the world right away and I wanted to put it on the stage."
