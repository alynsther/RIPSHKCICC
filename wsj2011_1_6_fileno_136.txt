BERLINâ€”German manufacturing orders rose far more sharply in November than expected thanks to an increase in orders from beyond the euro zone, the economics ministry said Thursday. 

Orders jumped a seasonally adjusted 5.2% on a monthly basis in November, much more than the 1% rise that analysts polled by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast and an improvement on the 1.6% rise in October. 

The ministry said in a statement that, in addition to large orders, German manufacturers benefited from a generally improving market for their goods. "Industry is starting the new year in a good atmosphere for orders," the ministry said. 

The November increase was due to a 8.2% rise in foreign orders, led by demand from customers outside the euro zone. Foreign demand from beyond currency bloc jumped 14.8%, while orders for German manufactured goods from within the euro zone fell 1.4% in November from the month earlier, the ministry said. Domestic orders were up 1.5%.

The data "confirmed the recent underlying positive trend and fully justifies the upbeat tone of recent business confidence indicators that continue to point to further strength in the German manufacturing sector," said  Annalisa Piazza, an economist at Newedge.

Orders for investment goods rose 9.1%, showing the biggest rise overall, while producer goods orders increased 1.0% in November. Demand for consumer products, meanwhile, fell 1.6% from October. On a yearly basis, orders rose an unadjusted 21.7% in November, following an annual rise of 14.2% in October. 

The two-month comparison, which irons out some fluctuations in the data, showed manufacturing orders rose 2.1% in the October-November period compared with August to September. November output data are scheduled for release Friday at 1100 GMT.
