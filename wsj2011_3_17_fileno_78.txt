TOKYOâ€”In the latest attempt to cool down reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, helicopters from Japan's Self-Defense Force started dropping ocean water on top of the overheated units.

The measure, announced by the Japan Nuclear Agency, is seen as a highly unusual step and has never been tried before in Japan. The agency also said that power cables from an outside source would be available at Fukushima as early as this afternoon. 

Television pictures showed helicopters making repeated runs over the site and spraying water on top of the troubled reactors. In addition, water cannon trucks from the Tokyo police department were expected to be used to spray additional water onto the units. 

The measures came as officials stepped up their efforts to stabilize the situation at the plant. Fires or explosions have hit four of the six units, leading to a number of radiation leakages that have pushed radiation levels nearby to levels well above normal. 

The nuclear agency also said that it was close to completing the connection of power cables from outside sources to restore power to at least two of the units, which would enable their vital cooling pumps to begin operating again. 

The government has a 20-kilometer (12 mile) evacuation order in place with those within 20 kilometers and 30 kilometers advised to stay indoors.
