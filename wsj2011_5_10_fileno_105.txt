After years of seemingly foregone conclusions, some measure of parity has actually returned to the English Premier League this year. 

Barring a pair of mind-boggling upsets, Manchester United will march to its record 19th title this month. But with two matches remaining, the most United can finish with is 82 points (teams get three points for a win and one point for a draw). That would be the lowest points total for a Premier League champion since United needed only 80 in 2000-01. What's more, the sum total of the points for the top four Premier League teams stands to hit its lowest point in at least seven years.

Meanwhile, there's even further evidence of parity with the league's bottom dwellers. West Ham, in last place, with 33 points, seems headed for relegation out of the league. Even if they didn't take a single point from their final two games, they would have the second-highest points total for a last-place side since the Premier League moved to its current 20-team format in 1995. The total for the bottom three teams, which will all be relegated, already is the highest it has been since 1998, at 105 points. 

Even if Manchester United beat its final two opponents—Blackburn and Blackpool—and West Ham lost its remaining matches, the spread from first to last would be 49 points. It hasn't been that small since 1999.
