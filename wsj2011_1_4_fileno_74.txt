Broadway enjoyed what was likely the highest-grossing week in its history this holiday season, with at least three shows—"Wicked, "Phantom of the Opera" and "The Lion King"—reporting the highest one-week dollar figures in their respective runs on the Great White Way.

For the week ending Jan. 2, the industry's total gross—$34.99 million—was up 24% from the same week last season. The one-week figure is almost certainly the largest in history, though the Broadway League, which compiles the data each week, declined to call it the highest because of a 2009 change in its methodology. Attendance also increased over the same week last year, from 250,134 to 272,864.

Looking at capacity alone, 20 shows hit 90% attendance, 27 shows saw more than 80% of their seats filled and 32 were at more than 70% capacity.

"It wasn't just a few big record-breakings. It was an across-the-board success," said Charlotte St. Martin, executive director of the Broadway League.

At the TKTS booth in Times Square, the number of tickets sold was up almost 10% compared with the same week last year, according to Victoria Bailey, executive director of the Theatre Development Fund, the not-for-profit organization that operates the TKTS program.

The holiday week between Christmas and New Year's Eve is traditionally a high point for Broadway, with spikes in attendance and average paid admission prices. This year, the combination of piling snow and a number of productions approaching their closing dates may have filled seats.

"People getting stuck in the city probably helped," Ms. Bailey said. "It also meant that New Yorkers didn't go away. There were a lot of shows closing. For New Yorkers who were here, it was a last chance."

For the week ending Jan. 2, "Wicked" grossed $2.22 million, breaking its own record for the highest weekly gross on Broadway, with tickets sold for an average of $153.97. It was the third week this season that "Wicked" has brought in more than $2 million.

Disney's "The Lion King" wasn't far behind. For the week ending Jan. 2, it set a box-office record at the Minskoff Theater with a weekly gross of $1.99 million—the highest in the show's 14 years. The average paid ticket price was $148.49.

The holidays were also good to Andrew Lloyd Webber's "The Phantom of the Opera," which saw its highest gross in its nearly 23-year run: $1.39 million. Tickets went for an average of $109.14. The show's previous high of $1.37 million was set during the same week last year—ending Jan. 3, 2010 —when the average ticket price was $115.78.

While "The Lion King" and "Wicked" had among the highest average ticket prices on Broadway, the season's holiday hit, "Elf," was in the same range—$140.81—during the week ending Jan. 2. And its house, the Al Hirschfeld Theatre, was at 95.8% capacity.

While tourist purchases and repeat ticket sales for popular shows contributed to the week, the shows that were set to close on Jan. 2 also saw full houses and high prices. "Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson" grossed $196,660 more than the week before, and was nearly 100% full. "Fela!" also maxed out its final week, grossing nearly $1 million and reaching 102% attendance, with tickets averaging $105.10. "West Side Story" grossed $1.4 million, representing 100% of its gross potential.
