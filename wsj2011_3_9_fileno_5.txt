The Wall Street Journal's ranking of the 50 top venture-backed companies was developed using proprietary data from Dow Jones VentureSource, more than 67,000 venture-backed companies, as well as more than 20,000 private-investment firms world-wide.

Review details of the methodology.

The ranking is based on four largely financial components and one qualitative one, drawn from these predictive indicators: 

• People matter: A history of success for both investors and executives suggests future success. 

• More money is better: A firm with more capital to deploy than its competitors will have an advantage. 

• Growth is good: Companies with higher valuations for their equity are more successful than smaller ones. 

• Intangibles abound: Company success can't be reduced to an equation.

The list is drawn from the approximately 10,600 U.S.-based, privately held venture-backed companies in the VentureSource database as of Nov. 30, 2010. VentureSource is owned by  News Corp., which also owns The Wall Street Journal.



To be eligible, a company must have raised an equity round of financing in the three years ended Nov. 30 and, because we are looking to identify less-known companies, have a valuation of $1 billion or less. This resulted in a field of 5,743 potential candidates. 

The rankings were calculated based on how each company scored in each of the following five components: 

• The track record of success for the venture-capital investors who sit on the company's board: 27.5% of final rank. We looked at the previous liquidity success of the company's venture investor directors from two perspectives: the number of mergers and acquisitions, and the sum of total market capitalization for IPOs. 

• The amount of capital raised by the company over past three years: 22.5% of final rank. We calculated the total equity raised over the previous three years and compared with the median amount raised by their industry peers. 

• An editorial ranking: 20% of final rank. Dow Jones VentureWire reporters and editors reviewed and ranked the companies.

•  The track record of success for the entrepreneurial CEO and founders: 17.5% of final rank. We looked at the number of mergers and acquisitions, and the sum of total market capitalization for IPOs. 

• The recent growth in value of the company: 12.5% of final rank. We looked at the absolute percentage change in valuation over the 12 months ended Nov. 30, 2010, which includes the use of statistically derived values. 

To calculate the final ranking, the five weighted components for each company were summed, and the companies ranked by the final scores.
