About 56.5 million people watched Barack Obama's surprise TV appearance Sunday night announcing the killing of Osama bin Laden. It was the president's biggest TV audience since he was elected, according to Nielsen Co. 

Mr. Obama's speech was carried on nine TV networks from 11:35 p.m. to 11:44 p.m. Eastern time and watched by 57% of U.S. households with their TVs on in those nine minutes, Nielsen said. By the time Mr. Obama took the air, reports had been leaking out for more than an hour that bin Laden had been killed by U.S. forcesâ€”ramping up anticipation on TV's most-watched evening of the week.Because Nielsen reports TV viewing as an average across each minute of a telecast, short telecasts often post much higher averages than long ones. It is much more likely that some viewers will tune away in the middle of a 90-minute State of the Union address, or a 75-minute televised wedding, lowering the per-minute average.

Mr. Obama has surpassed that tally in official TV ratings before -- on election night. That evening, an average of about 69 million people were watching election coverage at any given minute between 11 p.m. and 12:30 a.m. Eastern time, a period that included Mr. Obama's acceptance speech, according to Nielsen data. 

But none of Mr. Obama's more-recent speeches have come close. His March address on Libya averaged just 25.6 million viewers, Nielsen said. Mr. Obama's first address to a joint session of Congress in February 2009 fell just shy with an average of 52.4 million viewers at any given minute. Britain's Royal Wedding on Friday drew an average of 22.8 million viewers per minute. 

Of course, Mr. Obama's speech on Sunday had something else going for it: its brevity.
