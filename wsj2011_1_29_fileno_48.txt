A former aide to three U.S. presidents whose body was found in a garbage dump in December was killed by "blunt force trauma" during an assault, the Delaware medical examiner's office said Friday.

The body of John "Jack" Wheeler, a 66-year-old defense consultant and advocate for Vietnam War veterans, was spotted tumbling from a garbage truck in Wilmington, Del., by a landfill worker Dec. 31. 

Authorities determined that the body had been picked up from a commercial trash bin in Newark, Del. The medical examiner pronounced Mr. Wheeler's death a homicide the following day but didn't immediately release a cause of death. 

A spokesman for the medical examiner said Friday that toxicology tests had been completed as part of the autopsy but declined to discuss which substances might have been found in Mr. Wheeler's blood.

Mr. Wheeler, who once worked for Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, appeared behaving erratically on building-surveillance videotapes taken on the days before his body was found. 

The medical examiner's report left many questions about his death unanswered, and police weren't commenting on Friday.
