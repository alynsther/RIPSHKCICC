LONDONâ€“The Nigerian army has launched attacks against militants in the Niger Delta after months of relative quiet in Africa's largest oil-producing region.

The army attacks are in response to renewed acts of piracy and threats by the militants after wide-scale disruptions to oil installations some years ago, according to Nigerian military officials. 

A spokesman for the Nigerian military joint task force in the Delta said in a text message that there had been a "skirmish between troops on a routine patrol and renegade militants, suspected to be associates of the wanted John Togo." 

Information published in the Nigerian media suggests the skirmish took place Wednesday. 

A spokesman for Mr. Togo, the gang leader who has eluded army efforts to capture him for years and returned to the creeks after accepting a previous amnesty, didn't return a request for comment. 

A 2009 amnesty program for Niger Delta militants was credited with bringing a sharp decline in unrest in the region that had long been hit by violence, but sporadic incidents continue. 

The army spokesman said the operation came after militants' threats in the region and "recent cases of sea robbery and harassment of traders in the creeks." 

Several civilians died late last year when the army came into the area, located in the western part of the Niger Delta, searching for Mr. Togo. 

The army spokesman said the location under attack was at "a comfortable distance away from the community."
