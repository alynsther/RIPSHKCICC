Taiwanese Premier Wu Den-yih recently revealed that when the 2010 figures come in, they will show that the island's economy grew by more than 10%. The unemployment rate has fallen below 5%, from more than 6% in 2009. The good news is thanks in part to cuts in income and profit taxes over the past two years, as well as improving relations with mainland China. But all that growth has increased income inequality, and some politicians are raising the banner of class warfare.

For instance, the Kuomintang mayor of Taipei, Hau Lung-bin, has come up with a plan to punish the rich by more than doubling the property tax for those who live in "luxury" homes. This will not be determined by the home's value, but rather by subjective criteria such as opulent decorations. The targets are the nouveaux riches who live in buildings with names like "The Palace."

"The tax is aimed at reducing the wealth gap and achieving social justice," Mayor Hau says. His candor may be admirable, but his policy is not. Rather than using taxes to raise revenue, Taipei is undertaking to punish some of its citizens for their success. 

Perhaps the targeted buildings can erect facades so that they look like derelict tenements to please the mayor. But it would serve Mr. Hau right if the residents take their skills, work ethic and money where they are better appreciated.
