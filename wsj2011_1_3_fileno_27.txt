Norges Bank's new governor started his six-year tenure Monday by outlining some of the challenges Norway's economy faces from domestic factors, such as rising house prices, as well as from the global economy, saying its pension fund's aim to invest more in emerging markets is "reasonable." 

Norges Bank is responsible for monetary policy and manages Norway's foreign-exchange reserves and the government's pension fund, which has a market value of almost $500 billion. 

"If we look for domestic risk factors the future development of the housing market and the borrowing pattern by households is one of the areas that we should follow closely," Oystein Olsen said in an interview. 

"I will not use the word bubble, but there is no doubt that over the last few years the increase in housing prices in Norway has been stronger than many other countries," Mr. Olsen said. 

Mr. Olsen, former managing director of Statistics Norway, Monday took over from Svein Gjedrem, who had been in post since 1999. 

Turning to factors beyond Norway's borders, Mr. Olsen said "imbalances and problems in the international economy" mean that the bank can expect "fresh challenges in many of its primary areas." 

"The international financial crisis uncovered serious shortcomings in regulation and oversight of the financial system," Mr. Olsen said. "Norges Bank will play an active role in developing a policy framework, surveillance and the use of instruments to regulate the financial sector." 

On its pension fund's investments, Mr. Olsen said the question of which geographical regions to invest in was a key one for the fund. "There are some good arguments for the fund investing more in emerging markets and over time I think that is a reasonable strategy," Mr. Olsen said.
