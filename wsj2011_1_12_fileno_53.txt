  Q: I enjoyed your piece on "what makes kids creative." But how could you write the article without mentioning one of the biggest obstacles in schools to developing creativity—the emphasis on standardized tests?

 A:  Two elements of creativity are fluency, or the ability to produce many ideas, and originality, or the ability to produce unique and unusual ideas. Many experts say schools' ability to nurture these skills in children is at risk because of the trend you cite, toward rote learning and preparation for standardized testing. Federal school-reform legislation, the "No Child Left Behind" Act, requires basic-skills testing to evaluate school performance. However, the resulting pressure on teachers to produce rising standardized-test scores has sparked a trend toward "teaching to the test"—increased classroom time spent on skill drills, and less time spent allowing children to explore ideas in an open-ended way. When teachers are striving to teach children the "right" answer, they are less likely to tolerate the "wrong" answers kids inevitably generate as they develop their own novel ways of interpreting the world around them. 

Other factors may be at work, too. Some experts say kids are putting in too much computer and TV time. While some interactive videogames and computer activities allow kids to engage in problem-solving, which is one kind of creative behavior, users in most cases are still limited to the options programmed into the products. Other analysts fault today's highly involved "helicopter parents," saying they over-schedule children to the extent that kids don't have opportunities to discover new ideas and activities for themselves. Finally, parents who are perfectionists or habitually critical also stifle the self-acceptance and spontaneity needed for creativity.
