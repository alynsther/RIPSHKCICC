NEW DELHI -- IndiGo, India's largest budget carrier by market share, Wednesday said it will start flights to overseas destinations in August.

The airline has received approval from India's civil aviation ministry to operate flights from several cities in India to Singapore, Bangkok, Dubai and Muscat. Details of the flights will be announced in the comings months, it said.

IndiGo will become eligible to fly overseas from August after completing five years of domestic operations as per Indian government rules. The rules also stipulate that a domestic airline needs to have a fleet of at least 20 planes.

IndiGo, which recently ordered 180 planes from Airbus, has a fleet of 34 Airbus planes. It offers 221 daily flights to 24 destinations across the country.

IndiGo will join SpiceJet Ltd., India's second-biggest budget carrier by market share, which began international flights last October. Jet Airways (India) Ltd., Kingfisher Airlines Ltd. and Air India also operate international flights.
