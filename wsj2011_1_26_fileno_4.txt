In a move aimed at celebrating the role of entrepreneurs in the economy, Kentucky Gov.  Steve Beshear last week unveiled the state's first small-business specialty license plate.

The plates, which feature a storefront logo proclaiming small business the "foundation of Kentucky growth," are meant to show that Kentucky is an entrepreneur-friendly state, Gov. Beshear said in a statement.

"Small businesses power our economy, from main street to the farm and everywhere in between," he says, pledging to help owners grow and thrive.

Designed by a local printer and chosen in a statewide competition launched last fall by the Kentucky Commission on Small Business Advocacy, the plates are available for $25 each, plus an additional $19 paid to the county clerk. The price doesn't include extra fees for vanity plates. 

"It's for small-business owners and anyone who wants to support small business," says  Mark Johnson, a branch manager in the small-business division of the state cabinet for economic development.

Proceeds will go towards supporting small- and micro-business development in the state, according to Partners for Entrepreneurial Advancement in Kentucky, or PEAK, a statewide non-profit group that's handling orders.

The new plates aren't for all, though. Commercial vehicles – some of which are owned by small businesses – won't be allowed to substitute the specialty plates for a proper commercial license.
