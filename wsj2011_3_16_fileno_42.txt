NEW DELHI â€“  Toyota Motor Corp.'s India unit said Wednesday it will raise production capacity at its two south Indian factories to 210,000 units a year from 150,000 units now to slash the long waits on its vehicles. 

Toyota Kirloskar Motor Pvt. Ltd. will raise capacity at its first factory to 90,000 vehicles a year during the July-September quarter from the current 80,000 units, while output at its second factory will be lifted to 120,000 a year in the first half of 2012 from 70,000 now. 

The auto maker said it will start making 20,000 units of Corolla Altis at the second plant in the first half of next year. 

"The huge demand for the Etios has further provided momentum to expand our production capacity. We will enhance our production capacity to cater to our customers' growing demand,"  Hiroshi Nakagawa, managing director of Toyota Kirloskar said. 

The company has two factories at the same complex near Bangalore. 

It manufactures the Innova multi-purpose vehicle, the Corolla Altis sedan and the Fortuner sport utility vehicle at the first factory. 

Toyota Kirloskar recently introduced the sedan Etios from the second factory and recently postponed introducing the small car Etios Liva from the same factory to June from an earlier planned April due to the long waiting period.
