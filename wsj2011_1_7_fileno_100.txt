Knicks forward Amar'e Stoudemire returns to the city where he starred for eight seasons when the Knicks travel to Phoenix to take on the Suns at 10:30 p.m. Friday. Mr. Stoudemire will face off against longtime sidekick Steve Nash, whose pinpoint passes helped develop Mr. Stoudemire into an NBA All-Star. 

Together, the duo led the Suns to two seasons of more than 60 wins. Mr. Stoudemire made five All-Star teams as a member of the Suns after they drafted him ninth overall in the 2002 draft. "It was a great run when I was there, with nothing but great memories," said Mr. Stoudemire, who said he thought Phoenix fans would welcome him enthusiastically.

It's a Happy New Year at Rutgers. Defensive tackle Eric LeGrand has full sensation in his entire body and movement in his shoulders. The 20-year-old was paralyzed while making a tackle during an Oct. 16 game against Army and doctors initially feared he would not regain any feeling below the neck. Mr. LeGrand's paralysis has now been diagnosed as incomplete and a release from the school says he is breathing without a ventilator.

If the Jets and Colts end up testing the NFL's new postseason overtime rules—the team that loses the coin toss is guaranteed a possession as long as its opponent doesn't score a touchdown on its first possession—expect Colts kicker Adam Vinatieri to be disappointed.

"Honestly, I'm not a fan of it," he said. "I guess the way I look at it is that your offense is supposed to score and your defense is supposed to keep the other team from scoring, and if they do that, you get the ball back anyways."
