UNITED NATIONSâ€”Syria is expected to withdraw its bid for a seat on the U.N.'s Human Rights Council after intense diplomatic lobbying against Damascus in the wake of its bloody crackdown against antigovernment protestors, diplomats said.

Syria announced its bid for a place on the Geneva-based council that monitors human-rights violations weeks before the popular uprising against the Assad government erupted in March. As it was one of four countries contesting just four seats from the U.N.'s Asia Group, it was guaranteed to win.

But diplomats said Kuwait has stepped forward to be the fifth candidate, posing Syria a challenge that it will likely back away from rather than face a humiliating defeat.

"We understand that Syria will withdraw its bid to become a member of the Human Rights Council," said a spokesman for the British mission to the U.N. " If true, then we welcome that move and believe it is absolutely the right thing to happen" since "we consider it completely inappropriate for a country conducting such violent repression against peaceful protestors to be seeking membership of the Human Rights Council."

A U.S. official said Washington hadn't yet received official confirmation of Kuwait's offer to stand in the May 20 secret ballot in the General Assembly on council membership.

Calls to the Kuwaiti and Syrian missions to the U.N. seeking comment weren't immediately returned.

The 47-nation Human Rights Council was established in 2006 to take the place of the U.N. Human Rights Commission, which had come under widespread criticism, especially in the West, for having governments that were known human-rights violators as members. The new council, however, has been plagued by the same criticism.

On March 1, the council shored up its image in the West when it booted Libya from its seat as Col. Muammar Gadhafi rained down gunfire from planes on unarmed protesters, sparking the U.N.-endorsed NATO intervention.
