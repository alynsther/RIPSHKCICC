BEIJINGâ€” China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd. said Friday it expects a more than 50% decline in its 2010 net profit despite fast revenue growth, partly due to rising third-generation handset subsidy costs.

, said in a statement the 2010 earnings decline was also due to a "fast increase" of depreciation and amortization as well as network, operations and support expenses. 

In 2009, China Unicom's net profit fell 73% to 9.56 billion yuan from a restated 35.40 billion yuan in the previous year. Net profit in the January-September period plummeted 65% from a year earlier to 3.27 billion yuan, due to depreciation costs and expenses including 3G handset subsidies. 

The statement comes as China Unicom competes with China Mobile and  China Telecom Corp. for users of 3G services, which are more expensive for consumers but offer faster data speeds than second-generation services. 

China Unicom said in May it had raised handset subsidies for Apple Inc.'s iPhone handsets to boost demand for its 3G services. China Unicom, the country's only operator to offer the smartphone, started selling the iPhone 4 in China in September.
