  Q: I have noticed all the skinny-fit jeans for men. I have no gut and am in reasonably good shape, so I think I can pull them off. But I am 37. I don't want to look silly or like I'm trying to look like a teenager. Tell me also about the fitted shirts or jackets to go with them.  

—J.W., New Haven, Conn.

A: Skinny jeans have been popular for the past three years, and are finally a fixture in the mainstream. You can splurge on premium designer brands or rock the affordable styles from the likes of J.C. Penney, Levi's and the Gap.

Jeans are never about the label. What great jeans offer is that perfect fit—smooth, not too tight in the thighs and knees, and flattering to your backside. You should be able kick up your legs and sit down without feeling like you're in a vise. Don't be scared off by a little stretch in the cotton. Stretch is invisible and a good thing for comfort.

Don't buy your first pair online. Go to the sites and read the customer reviews to help you narrow your options. And then get ready for trial and error in the dressing room. 

Terms like "slim straight skinny," "super skinny" and "rigid stretch" can be more puzzling than informative. Pay close attention to the circumference of the leg opening. For instance, the 14¾ inches of Levi's skinny carpenter pants might be comfy. But if the measurement is closer to 13 inches, you're veering toward leggings land. Also, mature men should choose longer lengths that puddle around the ankle, instead of ultra-trendy high-water styles that expose the ankles.

What to wear on top? If you've got a disco body, go for any tight shirt tucked in. Most guys will feel better in a V-neck or polo-collared sweater. Just make sure it's not too oversized. Say yes to slim-fit dress shirts. Consider narrow Henley-collar knit tops with angled raglan sleeves, which are roomier for muscular guys. Top it off with a high-arm-holed sport coat or blazer, and you're ready to roll.
