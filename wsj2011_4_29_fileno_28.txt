MUMBAI -- Akar Tools Ltd., a unit of RL Steels and Energy Ltd., is set to acquire a Pune-based automotive-parts maker for 400 million rupees ($9 million).

The purchase will help Aurangabad-based Akar increase its forging capacity, widen its customer portfolio and reach new markets such as Europe, said Sunil Todi, managing director of Akar Tools, which makes precision-engineered tools and auto-leaf springs.

The acquisition will be funded through a mix of internal accrual and debt. he said. Akar presently exports do-it-yourself tools to the U.S. and West Asian markets.

To raise money for its expansion plans, Akar Tools is in talks with some private equity firms. Mr. Todi declined to comment on how much stake the company plans to sell.

Akar is setting up a new unit to expand its forging capacity to 20,000 tons a year from 8,000 tons, at an investment of 1.40 billion rupees ($31.5 million) over three years.

The company also plans to invest 600 million to 750 million rupees to expand the capacity of its alloy steel plant to 22,000 tons from 15,000 tons.

The group is also working towards merging Akar Tools and RL Steels in two years. It is not clear if Akar will be merged into RL or vice-versa, Mr. Todi said.
