Essar Africa Holdings Ltd., a subsidiary of India's Essar Group, and the Zimbabwe government have signed an agreement for the revival of the Zimbabwe Iron and Steel Co., or ZISCO, the Indian company said Thursday.

Essar and the Zimbabwe government will set up two joint venture companies that will acquire all the steel and mining assets and liabilities of ZISCO.

Essar will own 60% of the steel joint venture and 80% of the mining company, while the Zimbabwe government will hold the rest of the stakes.

ZISCO, which has a production capacity of one million tons of long steel products, has been non-operational for the past few years due to a shortage of funds for working capital and the maintenance of plant and equipment, irregular supply of power and other critical raw materials, and infrastructure.

ZISCO also owns iron ore and limestone mining rights.
