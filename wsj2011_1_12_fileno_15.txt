BRUSSELS—The European Union put its weight behind expanding the euro area's emergency lending facility on Wednesday. 

In a report and a press conference, the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, stressed the need for the size of the €440 billion ($ billion) European Financial Stability Facility to be reinforced and for its application to be expanded. 

"The EFSF funding capacity must be reinforced," said European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso Wednesday, adding that "the scope of activities should be widened." 

Mr. Barroso said he believed a consensus could be reached on the matter. He said this must be done by the next European summit of heads of state in the first week of February. 

The fund was set up for bailing out indebted euro-zone countries after the Greek debt crisis in May, and has already been tapped by Ireland. European leaders have agreed to replace it with a more permanent funding vehicle after it expires in 2013. 

Separately, France dismissed reports Wednesday that European leaders are looking to increase the size of the fund.
