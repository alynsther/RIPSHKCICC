The Dow Jones Industrial Average vaulted over 12000 for the first time in almost three years but couldn't hold that ground, closing just short of that milestone as investors digested President Obama's State of the Union address and the Federal Reserve's unanimous decision to stay the course on supporting the economy.

The Dow finished up 8.25 points, or 0.1%, at 11985.44, restrained by disappointing earnings from  Boeing.

The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 20.25 points, or 0.7%, to 2739.50, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 5.45 points, or 0.4%, to 1296.63. The S&P 500 fell just short of the 1300 barrier, which it last held in August 2008, trading as high as 1299.74 in afternoon trading.

The traversing of 12000, while fleeting, was the latest reminder of the durability of the stock market's bull run on a day dominated by news from the government and the Fed, whose massive interventions helped propel markets to the current levels.

Still, the bull market's reliance on the Fed has some investors questioning the durability of the rally, given continued economic weakness.

"After the housing bubble that burst in 2007-08, I think we'll probably never see those levels again," said  Peter Costa, a New York Stock Exchange floor trader with Empire Executions. "Nine to 10% of our people are just trying to make ends meet, and I'm not sure you can get that sort of a run-up when so many people are just trying to get basic needs met."

In addition to the Fed decision and business-friendly words from President Obama in his State of the Union address, the market cheered data Wednesday morning showing new-home sales coming in much stronger than expected.
