India's IDBI Bank Ltd. raised 10 billion rupees through a sale of bonds, two people familiar with the matter said Wednesday.

The state-run lender privately placed 15-year Upper Tier II bonds with a call option at the end of the tenth year, the people, who declined to be named, told Dow Jones Newswires.

The bonds will pay a yield of 9.40% at par, they said. It's unclear what the money would be used for.
