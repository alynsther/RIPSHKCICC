BEIJING— Alibaba.com Ltd. said Thursday its fourth-quarter profit rose 46% from a year earlier and pledged further steps to overcome a fraud scandal that prompted its chief executive to resign. 

Alibaba.com, whose business e-commerce site has shown strong growth, said it will work to identify and remove listings for additional suppliers it believes have a high risk of fraud and to ensure proper checks and balances inside the company. 

Alibaba.com Chief Executive  David Wei and Chief Operating Officer  Elvis Lee resigned last month after an internal investigation found more than 2,300 sellers on the site committed fraud, sometimes with the help of Alibaba sales staff. The company named  Jonathan Lu, chief executive of  Alibaba Group's

 retail website Taobao.com, to replace Mr. Wei.

 owns a roughly 39% stake. 

The revelation of the fraud investigation didn't have any effect on buyer activity on Alibaba's websites, Mr. Lu said on a teleconference to discuss the company's financial results. He didn't elaborate on the financial impact the scandal could have on Alibaba.com. 

Alibaba.com posted a fourth-quarter profit of 410.4 million yuan ($62.5 million), in line with analysts' estimates. Revenue exceeded expectations, rising 38% to 1.52 billion yuan.

The company warned that it expects China's export growth to slow this year due to rising costs and an appreciating yuan. It said it expects China's overall economic growth to remain robust but to moderate due to China's tightening monetary policy. Many of Alibaba.com's users are small and medium-sized Chinese exporters.
