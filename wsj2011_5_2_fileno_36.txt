NEW DELHI --India plans to leave unchanged the overseas borrowing limit for local companies at $40 billion in the current fiscal year, which started April 1, a senior finance ministry official said on Monday. 

Local companies received approvals to raise $25.6 billion through overseas borrowings last fiscal year, said the official, who didn't wish to be named. 

The official expects foreign funds to buy more local shares and bonds this year than what they purchased last year.
