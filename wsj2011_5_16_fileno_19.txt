A new damage estimate shows the powerful tornadoes that hit the South in late April caused insured losses of up to $6 billion, the highest figure yet to emerge from disaster-modelers. 

A single tornado that struck Tuscaloosa and Birmingham in Alabama accounts for nearly 40% of the estimate from disaster-modeling company Risk Management Solutions. 

The total insured losses from the violent weather that affected several states from April 25 to 28 will range from $3.5 billion to $6 billion, RMS said. 

An estimate last Monday from rival modeler AIR Worlwide put the number at $3.7 billion to $5.5 billion, but included storms from a wider range of datesâ€”April 22 to 28.

 warned investors it had about $1.4 billion in catastrophe losses for all of April. The second quarter, which ends June 30, is already slated to be Allstate's costliest period for disaster claims since 2008.
