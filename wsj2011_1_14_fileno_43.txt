The Metropolitan Opera has agreed to make about $2.75 million in renovations to increase the accessibility of its theater for the disabled, thereby settling a lawsuit with the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's office, a spokeswoman for the Met said Thursday.

The Met will reserve more wheelchair and companion seats prior to performances, eliminate barriers to several elevators and revise its emergency evacuation plans, according to the settlement.

In response to the U.S. Attorney office's investigation, prompted by a complaint from a member of the public, the Met already has renovated its restrooms and concession stands, installed additional seating and drinking fountains and added raised-letter and Braille signs, among other measures.
