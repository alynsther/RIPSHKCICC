With the deadline for negotiating a new collective bargaining agreement in the National Football League closing in, the players' union gained some leverage Tuesday when a federal judge backed the players in a dispute with the league over television revenues. 

Overturning a recent decision by a special master, who had awarded the players only limited damages in the case, U.S. District Court Judge  David Doty ruled that the league violated a deal with the players when it extended broadcast agreements with television networks. Mr. Doty called for a hearing to determine what the damages should be. 

The players union argued that the NFL agreed to only small increases in the fees the networks pay to broadcast games in exchange for payments that would continue even if labor strife canceled the entire 2011-2012 season. Lawyers for the union said the league accepted the below-market fees in order to bankroll any lockout of the players. 

The NFL argued that the courts should not intervene in such deals. 

The CBA expires at midnight Thursday. Owners have threatened to lockout the players without a new agreement. More than a week of mediation has produced little progress in talks between the two sides, who remain about $1 billion apart in discussions of how to divide roughly $9 billion in annual revenues.
