AMC's zombie hit is not afraid to make the audience squirm. Beyond the guts and gore, fans love the show for its characters and production quality, thanks largely to creator Frank Darabont—known for films such as "The Shawshank Redemption"—who has written and directed the series based on Robert Kirkman's comic-book series. The living will have to wait until fall for Season 2.

This cult-comedy favorite imagined a man shot into space by a mad scientist and forced to watch terrible movies, accompanied only by the snarky robot sidekicks he had created. Their wisecracking running commentary accompanies each film selection. In this installment, the group mocks the masterpieces "Project Moonbase," "Master Ninja I and II" and "The Magic Voyage of Sinbad." The "Master Ninja I" episode offers a glimpse of Demi Moore in her early 20s. 

In January, actress and singer Miley Cyrus, now 18, said goodbye to the TV series that made her famous, "Hannah Montana." Ms. Cyrus has been cultivating a more adult persona, but tweens and teens still mourning the show's demise will be excited for this DVD set featuring an alternate ending and cast-member goodbyes.
