Noel Cruz has opened Carmine Club Café, with partner Sam Rivera, his first new project since Elettaria shuttered in 2009. The restaurant pays tribute to the residential stretch of the West Village where it's located. 

With its decor, atmosphere and Mediterranean menu, Carmine Club Cafe pays tribute to its West Village neighborhood. 

"We wanted to kind of get a sense of [the neighborhood] not only with decor and atmosphere, but also how we approach the menu," Mr. Cruz said. Accordingly, the food has a deep Mediterranean influence, particularly Italian, French and Spanish. 

Chef Joe Vigorito's menu includes dishes such as snappy cuttlefish with heirloom potatoes, salsa verde and chili ($13) and a green salad with grape-must syrup, smoked ricotta and burnt orange vinaigrette ($9), which arrive on cheerily patterned plates. 

A recent lunch included the linguini with house-cured tuna, tomato, mint and bread crumbs ($14) and the popular pork burger. Made with a blend of Duroc and Berkshire pork, it's "kind of a reverse burger," Mr. Cruz said, with pork as the patty and beef—in the form of bresaola, or air-cured beef—as the bacon on top, and finished with Gouda and smoked pepper mayo. Wash it all down with a glass of Prosecco, conveniently on tap.
