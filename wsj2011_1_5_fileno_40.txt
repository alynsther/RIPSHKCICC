Stocks extended their winning streak to five days, adding to their New Year's run as encouraging data from the labor market and service sector pointed to a firming economic recovery.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 31.71 points, or 0.3%, to 11722.89, effectively reclaiming the highs reached at the top of dot-com bubble on Jan. 14, 2000, and marking another milestone on the stock market's recent five-month runup.

The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ended higher by 6.36 points, or 0.5%, at 1276.56, while the Nasdaq Composite advanced 20.95 points, or 0.8%, to 2702.20.

Investors found reasons to cheer after a pair of unexpectedly strong readings on jobs and services. One closely watched jobs report showed private-sector employment increasing by 297,000 jobs in December from the previous month, triple consensus expectations and the biggest monthly increase in the survey's history.

The unexpectedly strong private-sector jobs number comes ahead of two other closely watched indicators of the U.S. labor sector, capped by Friday's all-important nonfarm-payrolls figures.

Also on the economic front, a report on the nonmanufacturing sector turned in a reading of 57.1, its highest showing since 2006 and besting consensus expectations of a 55.6 reading. However, that report showed a decline in the employment reading, off a three-year high last month.

"This economy could be expanding considerably faster than anyone anticipated,"  Kent Engelke, chief economic strategist for Capitol Securities Management, said. "If Friday's jobs data comes in stronger than anticipated, I believe all the economic and monetary assumptions will be thrown on their head."

"The data today increases employment and lowers event risk: People can pay their mortgages, commercial real estate is coming back, and it affects people's ability to service their debt," Mr. Engelke said. "A lot of these financials were still trading on event riskâ€”people being foreclosed on and not being able to pay their debts."

The dollar also jumped on the economic news. The greenback gained more than 1% on the euro and the yen. Treasurys fell as the brighter economic picture dented the allure of safe-haven assets. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note rose to 3.49%, its highest level in two weeks.

Commodities, meanwhile, continued Tuesday's steep drops for much of the morning before mounting a formidable turnaround. Copper gained 0.9%, while crude oil added 1% to settle above $90 a barrel. Oil had fallen as low as $88.10 a barrel earlier in the session. Gold also slipped lower.

As Republican John Boehner took over as speaker of the House of Representatives Wednesday, prospects also grew for a more business-friendly environment that stock investors hope will further propel corporate performance.

"Having a balanced Congress gives corporations more confidence to spend," said  Roy Williams, chief executive of Prestige Wealth Management. "Corporate executives are feeling more comfortable now, and that leads to more hiring and more corporate spending." With earnings season on the way, Mr. Williams predicts a set of strong numbers that will drive markets higher.
