 said Thursday its 2010 net profit rose 25% from a year earlier, boosted by rising commercial property prices and improvements in its core rail operations, as well as stronger contributions from outside the city.



Net profit for the 12 months ended Dec. 31 rose to 12.06 billion Hong Kong dollars (US$1.55 billion), from HK$9.64 billion a year earlier. The result was above the average HK$8.88 billion net profit forecast of six analysts polled earlier by Thomson Reuters. 

Revenue rose 57% to HK$29.52 billion in 2010 from HK$18.80 billion. 

The blue-chip company, which is 77%-owned by the city's government, recommended a final dividend of 45 Hong Kong cents, compared with 38 Hong Kong cents in 2009. 

The company has the right to develop commercial and residential properties above some of its train stations in Hong Kong, and owns a number of shopping malls and commercial buildings. 

In 2010, those properties had a revaluation gain of HK$4.07 billion, compared with a revaluation gain of HK$2.80 billion a year earlier.
