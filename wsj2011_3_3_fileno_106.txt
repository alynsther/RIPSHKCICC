Bay Area executives are optimistic about their companies' growth prospects this year as the economy continues to improve. More than 60% of chief financial officers in the region expect their companies' revenue to grow by at least 10% in 2011, and about 25% expect revenue growth of more than 50%, according to a survey of finance chiefs by Armanino McKenna, an accounting and consulting firm in San Ramon. Among other findings, technology companies generally expect higher growth than those in other industries. And companies say they plan to increase their spending on sales and marketing, hiring and capital projects as revenue rises.
