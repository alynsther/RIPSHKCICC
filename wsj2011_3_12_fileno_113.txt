I try my best to be a minimalist when camping. Emphasis on "try." There's one thing I bring on every outing: extra footwear. After a long day of hiking, especially in muddier spring conditions, there is nothing more pleasant than starting a fire, grabbing a whiskey (another mandatory luxury) and kicking off your boots without having to lace them up again to fetch more firewood, or when, you know, nature calls. In the summer, lightweight, flat-packing flip-flops are perfect. In cooler weather, however, comfort comes at a premium. 

So I pack these…booties. They are a little bulky. They make you look like you are on a sleepover aboard the Millennium Falcon. But they're also filled with goose down, meaning, come morning, after everyone is done making fun of your...booties, you'll have the happiest feet on the campground.
