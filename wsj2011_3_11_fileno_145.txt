FRANKFURTâ€”Consumer-price inflation in Germany, Europe's largest economy, showed the highest reading in more than two years in February as energy prices continued to rise, the Federal Statistics Office, said Friday, as it revised its annual reading higher. 

Consumer prices rose 0.5% from a month earlier in February, according to final figures, unchanged from the preliminary figure published Feb. 25. But consumer prices increased 2.1% from a year earlier, compared with a 2.0% preliminary estimate. Annual inflation was last higher in October 2008 when it was 2.4%. 

Economists had expected the final data to remain unchanged from the preliminary estimates. 

Energy was main factor behind the rise in the inflation rate in February, as energy prices surged 10.2% from a year earlier, Destatis said. It added that since March 2010 energy-price increases have been significantly above the general inflation rate. Destatis said that household energy prices rose by 9.4% in February from a year earlier. 

Food prices were up 3.4% from a year earlier. Destatis said food price increases have been above the overall inflation rate for nearly a year. 

German consumer prices, when calculated in line with the European Union-harmonized methodology, rose 0.6% from a month earlier in February and 2.2.% from a year earlier, according to final figures, unchanged from the preliminary data, Destatis said.
