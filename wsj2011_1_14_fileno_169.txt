While most New Yorkers were complaining about the snow Wednesday, Prosper Assouline was being knighted at Sotheby's. The publishing magnate received the Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres honor from the French Ministry of Culture. This has in the past recognized people of various degrees of significance: Clint Eastwood, Marcel Marceau, and yes, Jude Law.

"At first I thought this whole thing was a joke," said Mr. Assouline. "But I'm glad I got this award because this is the only one you don't apply for. And sure, I have friends that have LÃ©gions and they deserve them. They are members of prestigious institutions or bankers or politicians. But me? I'm just a circus guy from Morocco who prints books for fun. So I guess I have to treat this like my second wedding."

In a way, Mr. Assouline, who has published such coffee-table books as "The Well Lived Life" and "Vintage Cocktails," was always destined to receive one of these honors. The prize was founded on May 2, 1957, exactly one day after the entrepreneur was born. Since then, notable French and foreign leaders in the fields of arts have been honored with green medals and commander, officer, and knight titles. For example, Kylie Minogue is a knight as of 2008, while T.S. Eliot was one of the first to receive the highest commander honor in 1960.

"We so are not about medals," assured his wife and business partner, Martine. "So our first reaction was not to believe any of this." But that's exactly what the evening's presenter, the architect Thierry Despont, encouraged the pair to do.

 "You didn't ask for it, you deserve it, you do not refuse it and Martine will wear it for you," said Mr. Despont with a grin, as he toasted his best friend.
