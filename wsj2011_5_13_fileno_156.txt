European stock markets fell Friday as worries about sovereign debt trumped strong results from EADS and faster-than-expected economic growth in France and Germany. 

The Stoxx Europe 600 index dropped 0.5% to close at 280.50, as a weaker tone on Wall Street added to the pressure on European shares.

The index was up as much as 0.5% earlier in the day after data showed stronger-than-expected growth in France and Germany in the first quarter. 

But markets turned lower after the European Commission warned that the Greek economy will likely contract more than previously thought. 

Most smaller-economy markets felt pressure, with Spain's IBEX 35 index falling 1.3% to 10356.50 as worries about the banking sector in neighbor Portugal brought Spain's situation back into focus. Standard & Poor's Ratings Services said Friday that most Portuguese banks will likely need to take "decisive action" to meet new capital requirements. 

Portugal's PSI General index was little changed at 2835.06, while the Greek ASE Composite held on to a 0.1% gain at 1356.24. 

Spanish bank BBVA dropped 1.9%. Chief Operating Officer  Angel Cano said that Spain will have to clean up its troubled savings banks, known as Cajas, before they will be able to attract private investment.

 dropped 0.8% after weaker margins led to lower first-quarter profit at the telecom group. 

Other earnings announcements painted a more-positive picture. 

Aerospace and defense group  EADS rallied 5.8%. The owner of Airbus swung to a first-quarter net loss due to the impact of exchange-rate moves, but sales and earnings before interest and taxes comfortably beat market expectations. The company also said it may step up its production of single-aisle aircraft. 

  Philip Isherwood, equity strategist at Evolution Securities, said markets are caught up in a case of "fear vs. fundamentals" as worries over a potential slowdown are balanced against generally strong earnings and improving confidence among companies. He said many companies have raised their dividend payouts in recent weeks, which is a sign of medium-term confidence. 

"You don't just raise dividends on Friday to cut them on Monday. Either corporates are completely delusional or they are seeing a continuation that the market doesn't," he said. 

In the U.K., the FTSE 100 index fell 0.3% to 5925.87, led by 2.9% drop for  ITV.
