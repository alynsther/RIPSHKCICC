Shortstop prospect Eduardo Nunez appears to be edging into the lead to be the Yankees' utility infielder, nudging Ramiro Pena to the side. Pena is reliable, but Nunez offers tantalizing potential with his ability to hit for average, his strong arm and his speed. The Yankees want Nunez, rated the organization's eighth-best prospect by Baseball America, to show enough growth that he can claim the job. If he can't, Pena and his reliability will break camp with the Yankees. Nunez is hitting .348 with a home run, a double and five RBIs in a camp-leading 23 at-bats. Pena is hitting .158 with one RBI in 19 at-bats. "I think I have a good chance. I'm working hard," Nunez said.

The Mets made the obvious official Wednesday: Oliver Perez will not be in their starting rotation. They're not releasing him just yet, though. Instead, the Mets will look at Perez as a possible situational left-hander in the bullpen. He is slated to pitch in relief Saturday against the Braves. "I told him, I think it's a great fresh start for him, so we'll see what comes out of it," manager Terry Collins said. Perez held left-handers to a .214 average last season.

After a lengthy preseason stint in Mexico and Arizona, the Red Bulls wrapped up their exhibition season on Tuesday night with a 1-1 draw against Club Atlas in Phoenix.

 The Red Bulls will return to New Jersey to prepare for their season opener on March 19 against the Seattle Sounders at the Red Bull Arena in Harrison. The start of the regular season comes with some bad news, as defender Chris Albright will miss four to six weeks after a surgery on Tuesday for a tear in his lateral meniscus in his left knee.
