Some call it "keeping up with the Christies," referring to the growing number of Republican governors who are emulating the tough-talking, fiscally austere approach of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.

"They're all trying to out-reform each other," says Michael Petrilli of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a leading think tank on education issues. "It's an opportunity for them to make themselves national figures."

Now that Wisconsin's battle over collective bargaining has moved into a new phase, attention is shifting to Florida, where new GOP Gov. Rick Scott is following Wisconsin's lead in curbing the power of state public employee unions. A bill moving through the Republican-controlled legislature would end the state's role as collection agent for the union dues of state employees. In the future, the unions would have to seek support from their members the way other private groups doâ€”through persuasion rather than coercion. Mr. Scott is also pushing for state and local workers to contribute for the first time to their own pension programs.

But the part of his agenda that is likely to be enacted first is in education. A bill scheduled to be voted on by the state Senate this week would eliminate teacher tenure for new teachers hired after July 1 and tie teacher merit pay to student test scores. "Good teachers know they don't need tenure," Mr. Scott says. "There is no reason to have it except to protect those that don't perform as they should."
