KABULâ€”Afghan officials confirmed that the U.S. helicopter-borne teams that killed Osama bin Laden took off from eastern Afghanistan, and said the choppers didn't make any stopovers inside Pakistan on the way. 

"It was not necessary to refuel as the distance was short to Pakistan," said Afghanistan National Security Adviser Rangin Dadfar Spanta. He said the Afghan government wasn't involved in the operation before it was launched; the U.S. briefed President Hamid Karzai's administration only after Mr. bin Laden had been killed, he said. 

While Mr. Spanta wouldn't disclose details of the operation, one of Mr. Karzai's aides said the U.S. helicopters flew from the Jalalabad air field, which houses a major coalition base. Jalalabad is some 170 miles from Islamabad, Pakistan's capital. The aide said bin Laden's body transited through Afghanistan, most likely by way of the Bagram air field, the main U.S. base in eastern Afghanistan, before being shipped out for Monday's burial at sea.

The U.S. and Pakistan have said that Pakistan contributed intelligence that helped pinpoint Mr. bin Laden's compound. An Afghan official said Afghanistan's own spy agency, the National Directorate of Security, also aided in locating Mr. bin Laden.

The operation against al Qaeda's chief was run directly by the U.S., not by the U.S.-led International Security Assistance Force that has commanded by Gen. David Petraeus, coalition officials said.
