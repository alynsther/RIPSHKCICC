The Mets have agreed to a minor-league contract with utility man Willie Harris (pictured above) and will invite him to spring training, a person with knowledge of the situation confirmed Friday.

 Mr. Harris, 32, who has played the outfield for most of his career, is a .239 hitter in 895 games but batted just .183 in 224 at-bats last season for the Washington Nationals. He will sign with the Mets pending his passing a physical, the person said.

The agent of Nuggets forward Carmelo Anthony, Leon Rose, was in attendance for Friday night's Knicks-Kings game, but Knicks team president Donnie Walsh said not to read anything into it. 

Mr. Walsh would not comment on any of the rumored deals involving Mr. Anthony, in whom the Knicks have an interest. Mr. Walsh said he didn't feel it was right to make trade talk public.
