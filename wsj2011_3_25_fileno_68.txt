On Saturday, Sri Lanka is favored to win its ICC Cricket World Cup quarterfinal against England by most oddsmakers. Which means, based on the tournament so far, that the Sri Lankans are in serious trouble.

England's run to the knockout rounds has bucked the odds at every turn. In an unpredictable series of headscratchers and heartstoppers during the group stage, England contrived to lose to Bangladesh and Ireland, tie with India, scrape past the Netherlands and beat South Africa and West Indies.

It means England begins Saturday's game in Colombo as a 13/8 underdog. By contrast, Sri Lanka qualified from Group A with the best net run-rate, has the tournament's leading run-scorer in Kumar Sangakarra and the backing of a capacity home crowd, which helps to explain its shorter price of 8/15 to reach the semifinals.

For a range of reasons, however, England looks better value. For starters, the side has performed much better under pressure and has the tools to cause problems for any team. It also leads the head-to-head record between these two with 23 victories to Sri Lanka's 21 and has won four of the previous six one-day international meetings. That run includes a 3-2 series victory during its last tour of Sri Lanka and a six-wicket win most recently at the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy in South Africa.

All-rounder Eoin Morgan top-scored with 62 not out back then and England will likely need him to be at his best if it is to reach the semifinals. Morgan can be backed at 5/1 to be England's leading batsman.
