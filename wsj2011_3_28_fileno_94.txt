"The Ring" is back—and so are the planks. On Wednesday and Saturday, the Metropolitan Opera will present a reprise of Wagner's "Das Rheingold," the first installment of the four-part "Ring" cycle, created by Robert Lepage, which made its premiere in the fall. The second opera in the series, "Die Walküre," opens April 22.

Each of the four operas will use the same basic set, designed by Carl Fillion, weighing some 90,000 pounds. It consists of a series of 24 planks that rotate around a central steel axis. Singers and acrobats stand on the set, and computer-generated projections alter the look of it. All the while, the planks shift positions to suggest interiors, landscapes, water and exteriors. At the end of "Das Rheingold," they move into the formation of the famous bridge on which the gods enter Vallhalla. On opening night last fall, however, a plank malfunction left the performers to walk off the stage like ordinary humans. 

How does "Die Walküre" stack up against "Das Rheingold"? The Met's music director, James Levine, conducted "Rheingold" in the fall, but has withdrawn from this week's performances to recuperate from back surgery—and to conserve energy for "Die Walküre," which he plans to conduct. Principal guest conductor Fabio Luisi will lead "Das Rheingold." 

Both operas feature the Welsh bass Bryn Terfel, but "Die Walküre" adds to the stage the powerhouse vocals of Deborah Voight as Brünnhilde. While in size and technical aspects the operas share many aspects, "Die Walküre" advances the story—and takes its time to tell it.
