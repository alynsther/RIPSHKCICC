BERLIN—German exports shot to a record-high in March, the Federal Statistical Office said Monday, recording a second consecutive month of gains and signaling continued strength in the country's economy. 

German exports rose by 7.3% monthly to €98.3 billion ($141.1 billion) in March, according to calendar- and seasonally-adjusted data, the office said. This was its highest level since the office began tracking such trade data in 1950. In February exports were up 2.8%. 

Growth in imports was also strong, rising 3.1% on month in March to €79.4 billion, it said. That followed a 4% rise in February. The trade surplus of Germany, Europe's largest economy, widened to €17 billion in March from €11.9 billion in February, according to unadjusted data. 

The current account surplus came in at €18.8 billion in March compared with €8.7 billion in February, also according to unadjusted data, Destatis said.
