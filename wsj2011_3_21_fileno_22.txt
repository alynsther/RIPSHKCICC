NEW DELHI â€“India has stepped up efforts to screen food imports from Japan after March 11 for possible contamination due to radiation leaks from a crippled nuclear plant in the quake-hit nation, a senior Indian government official said Monday. 

The government has designated three laboratories to test samples of food items from Japan so that consignments can be cleared "quickly although after rigorous testing", said the official with the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India.

Low-level radiation was detected on some food products in Japan, and India is worried that any harmful imported products may contaminate its food stocks and pose health threats. India buys small quantities of processed food items, fruits and vegetables from Japan. 

Radiation levels around the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant--damaged after massive earthquake and tsunami that struck northeast Japan on March 11--spiked following a new explosion at one reactor and a fire at another last week. 

Japanese authorities are reporting progress Monday in cooling the affected reactors though it's still some time before the situation is fully normal. 

The Indian government has also asked customs officials, who usually clear any consignments of imported food, to carry out similar tests on food samples separately.
