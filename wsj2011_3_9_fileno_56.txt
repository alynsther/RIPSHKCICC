Erik Condra scored his second goal of the game with 2:17 to play and the Ottawa Senators stunned the red-hot New Jersey Devils on Tuesday night.

Craig Anderson made 31 saves as Ottawa handed the Devils only their third loss in the last 25 games and slowed New Jersey's frantic charge for a playoff berth.

Patrik Elias scored for New Jersey, which had a six-game home winning streak snapped and lost a chance to reach .500 for the first time since early in the season.
