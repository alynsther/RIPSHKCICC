 has added a direct air-cargo route between India and China, a move it said is aimed at serving booming regional trade growth. 

The new cargo flights, which began Tuesday, link Mumbai and New Delhi in India to Guangzhou in southern China and run five times a week using A310 aircraft. FedEx has been operating direct New Delhi-to-Shanghai cargo flights since 2005. 

FedEx, based in Memphis, Tenn., called China and India "two of the fastest-growing economies in the world" and noted that average annual growth in the intra-Asia air-cargo market is estimated at 7.9% over the next 20 years. 

The company's new cargo flights "will help businesses offer superior value and service to their customers, enabling greater access to two of the most rapidly developing markets in the world,"  David L. Cunningham Jr., Asia-Pacific president of FedEx's express unit, said in a prepared statement.
