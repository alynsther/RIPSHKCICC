LONDON—U.K. factory gate inflation picked up unexpectedly in December on a broad range of items, in particular petrol products. 

Output prices rose 4.2% in the year to December, higher than an upwardly revised 4.1% in November, data from the Office for National Statistics released Friday showed. Economists had expected a 3.9% gain. 

Output prices rose 0.5% month-to-month, up from 0.4% the previous month. 

The figures support the view that the Bank of England's next move is more likely an interest rate increase than a boost to stimulus. But central bank policy makers will want to see further evidence that the recovery is sustainable, before embarking on a tightening path. 

The data showed that petrol product prices rose by 12.6% from a year earlier, and 2.4% from a month earlier. Diesel and gas oil prices increased 2.9% over the month, while unleaded petrol prices gained 1.9%. 

Food product prices also rose at a rapid pace, increasing by 3.3% from a year earlier, equal to the pace seen in May 2009. 

Core output price inflation—which excludes volatile food, alcohol, energy and tobacco prices—decreased by 2.9% from a year earlier, less than the 3.1% decline economists expected. Factory-gate prices rose 0.2% from a month earlier, matching November's rise.
