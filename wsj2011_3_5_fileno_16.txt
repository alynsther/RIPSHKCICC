Count three more strikes against "Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark."

The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration has issued three serious violations of workplace safety standards to the troubled show's production company, the agency said Friday.

The citations, which carry $12,600 in proposed fines, come in response to the federal agency's investigation of four incidents that resulted in serious injuries to cast members.

A spokesman for the musical,  Rick Miramontez, said in a statement that the show "remains in compliance with all government agencies and continues to adhere to all safety protocols." The $65 million show is the most expensive in Broadway history.

The citations and proposed fines target 8 Legged Productions LLC, a production company for the $65 million musical, the most expensive in Broadway history. 

Serious citations are issued when "there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known," according to OSHA.

During its investigation, the federal agency found that "employees were exposed to the hazards of falls or being struck during flying routines because of improperly adjusted or unsecured safety harnesses," among other dangers.

The accidents have caused disruptions to the production's preview schedule and delays to its opening night, as well as injuries including a concussion and broken wrists.

The most recent incident occurred Dec. 20, when  Christopher Tierney, the primary "Spider-Man" stunt double, fell 25 feet during a performance. He was hospitalized with broken ribs, a hairline skull fracture and other injuries.

The New York state Department of Labor, which was also investigating "Spider-Man," issued two safety violations last month as a result of the same accidents. Those findings did not carry financial penalties.
