, the operator of the luxury Peninsula chain, on Tuesday reported a 13% rise in its 2010 net profit, as revenue rose across all its business segments. 

The company said in a statement that although hotel revenue has partly recovered to pre-economic crisis levels, inflation has affected costs, particularly of labor, and margins remain under pressure. 

"The performance of our hotels has varied quite significantly between different geographical locations, with strength in Greater China but recovery lagging in some parts of the U.S. and Japan," the company, adding the impact of the earthquake in Japan on its businesses couldn't be fully assessed yet. 

The Hong Kong-listed company, which is controlled by  Michael Kadoorie and his family, said net profit for the 12 months ended Dec. 31 rose to 3.01 billion Hong Kong dollars (US$386.01 million) from HK$2.66 billion a year earlier. 

Excluding a property revaluation gain of HK$1.94 billion, underlying profit rose 26% to HK$408 million from HK$323 million. Revenue rose 12% to HK$4.71 billion from HK$4.22 billion. Hongkong & Shanghai Hotels operates nine hotels in Hong Kong, New York, Chicago, Beverly Hills, Tokyo, Bangkok, Beijing, Shanghai and Manila, with a total of about 3,000 rooms. 

The company held an opening ceremony for the Peninsula Shanghai in March and said that construction work on the Peninsula Paris—its first hotel in Europe—began in September. The company said it plans to open the hotel in 2013. 

Total revenue at the Peninsula Tokyo rose 15% to HK$762 million due to higher occupancy and room rates, the company said, though it added "there remains significant pressure on the room rate from international travellers because of the strengthening of the Japanese yen and the resultant higher U.S. dollar cost for rooms as compared to other destinations." 

The powerful earthquake earlier this month drove occupancy levels at the property down to 20% during the past weekend from an average in the high 60%-level throughout 2010, Chief Executive  Clement Kwok said at a media conference. 

Revenue per available room, a closely watched performance measure, rose 22% in Hong Kong, 30% in the rest of Asia and 21% in the U.S. 

The hotelier said patronage of its iconic Peak Tram service in Hong Kong rose 11% in 2010 to 5.4 million passengers, an all-time record. The iconic 122-year-old tram carries tourists to the city's Victoria Peak from the central business district. 

Hongkong & Shanghai Hotels proposed a final dividend of eight Hong Kong cents, up from six Hong Kong cents in 2009. 

The company's shares rose 0.7% to HK$14.10 after the results were issued, in line with the broader market's 0.8% rise.
