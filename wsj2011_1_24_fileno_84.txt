New York Yankee fans best remember Andruw Jones as a teenage wunderkind, whose performance for the Atlanta Braves in the 1996 World Series showcased a player on the verge of greatness. Now Mr. Jones returns to the Bronx as New York's spare outfielder, hoping to revitalize a career that has taken a historic downturn since he turned 30.

Mr. Jones accumulated 68.6 Wins Above Replacement—a metric that determines how many wins a player contributes over an average Triple-A call-up—during his first 12 seasons, an average of 5.7 WAR a year. That figure put him on a better pace than Hall-of-Famers Al Kaline (68.5), Duke Snider (62.2) and Mike Schmidt (61.9) by that age. But in his three seasons since, Mr. Jones has averaged 0.6 WAR, marking the worst collapse of any position player who compiled at least 60 WAR before turning 31.

Mr. Jones's career path resembles that of Ken Griffey Jr., who had 78.6 WAR in his 12 seasons through age 30 but averaged 0.7 for the next 10 years. Mr. Snider averaged 1.4 WAR in his seven seasons after turning 31. Unlike Messrs. Griffey and Snider, however, Mr. Jones has generally avoided significant injury, making his struggles particularly puzzling.

Though Mr. Jones once seemed like a strong candidate for the Hall of Fame, the past three years have put his legacy in doubt. And if he doesn't make it, he would join a dubious club. Of the 26 eligible position players with at least 60 WAR through age 30, all but two are enshrined in Cooperstown: Sherry Magee and Ron Santo.

These players have had the fewest average Wins Above Replacement among players who had at least 60 total WAR through age 30.
