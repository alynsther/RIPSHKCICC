For five games it was right there. 

The championship-level basketball promised by Nets owner Mikhail Prokhorov when he bought the team last May was on display for 11 days this month. Led by recently acquired two-time All-Star Deron Williams, the Nets went on a five-game winning streak that included an 88-79 upset of the title-contending Celtics and a two-night, 253-point outburst against the Raptors in London. The team even came back from a 20-point deficit to beat the Clippers in overtime without Williams, who missed the game to witness the birth of his child.

But just as the Nets seemed to be realizing their potential, Williams' pain tolerance was reaching its threshold. A strained wrist limited him to just 1-for--12 shooting from the field in the team's worst offensive output of the season—an 84-73 loss to the surging Bulls last Thursday—and he was subsequently shelved three days later awaiting further diagnosis. 

Fortunately the 26-year-old point guard requires rest, not surgery, which means New Jersey's first five-game winning streak since the Jason Kidd era is more than a mirage. It could be a snapshot of the not-to-distant future. 

Williams doesn't deserve all the credit for New Jersey's recent surge. But the biggest change has been the sense of urgency Williams brought to the offense.

 "He's used to playing at a certain tempo," Nets coach Avery Johnson said. 

Before Devin Harris was included in the trade for Williams, the Nets were habitually late initiating their offensive sets, which meant they were perpetually fighting the 24-second clock.

"That's very hard to play like that," said shooting guard Anthony Morrow, who credits the change in pace to Williams' arrival.

Still, the Nets are only 5-7 since Williams arrived and their future is far from certain. He can become a free agent after the 2011-2012 season.
