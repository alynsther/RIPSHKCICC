The Dow Jones Industrial Average came within a hair's breadth of 12000 as investors embraced positive corporate earnings and looked ahead to this week's State of the Union address.

 and positive economic data have so far helped retain the momentum. 

Monday's rally was aided by expectations that President Obama may have a pro-business tilt in his annual State of the Union address to Congress on Tuesday.
