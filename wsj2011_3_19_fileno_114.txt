A photograph was Alex Steinweiss's breakthrough, but photography proved his downfall. In 1940, the young Brooklyn-born graphic designer at Columbia Records realized that the plain, boxy packaging of 78-rpm albums was an inviting place for poster-like illustrations that might appeal to customers. He persuaded a Times Square theater manager to put the words "Smash Song Hits by Rodgers & Hart" briefly on the marquee, photographed it and then placed the photo on an album cover with a background of red grooves, as on a vinyl record. An industry's marketing was transformed. Much of Mr. Steinweiss's work is collected by Kevin Reagan in 'Alex Steinweiss: The Inventor of the Modern Album Cover' (Taschen, 416 pages, $69.99), a handsome tribute that presents the album covers at just about their original size. Working in a Modernist-influenced style—Mr. Steinweiss's designs included bold colors, lean lines, cut-out figures, printed and handwritten lettering—he produced hundreds of covers like the ones above for Bing Crosby (1948), Paul Robeson (1943) and Béla Bartók (ca. 1956). The heavy use of photography for pop and rock albums in the 1950s and 1960s put him out of business. But he has another legacy: In 1948, Mr. Steinweiss (who is now 93) invented the pasteboard container for long-playing albums, providing a venue for all the cover designers and liner-notes writers who followed . . . until the compact disc and iTunes made them largely obsolete as well.
