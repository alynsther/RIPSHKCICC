LONDONâ€”Most developed economies will continue to grow at a "robust" pace in the months ahead, but Italy, China and India may be heading for a slowdown, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's composite leading indicator. 

The Paris-based think tank Monday said its leading indicator of economic activity in its 33 members rose to 103.1 in January from 102.8 in December. 

The leading indicator for Japan rose to 104.7 from 103.9 in December, indicating that economic growth was set to pick up before the earthquake that struck Friday. 

"The CLIs for Germany, Japan and the United States continue pointing to robust expansion relative to trend," the OECD said. "Signs of regained growth momentum characterize the CLIs for France and Canada. The CLI for the United Kingdom points to a slow but stable pace of expansion." 

However, the leading indicator for Italy fell to 102.2 from 102.3, while the leading indicator for China fell to 101.6 from 101.7 and the leading indicator for India fell to 99.3 from 99.7. 

"The CLI for Italy continues pointing to a moderate downturn," the OECD said. "The CLI for China continues pointing to the possibility of a moderate downturn. The CLI for India continues pointing to a slowdown." 

Taken as a whole, the leading indicators suggest growth in the Group of Seven leading developed economies will pick up, as will growth in Russia. 

The OECD's leading indicators are designed to provide early signals of turning points between the expansion and slowdown of economic activity, and are based on a wide variety of data series that have a history of signaling changes in economic activity.
