More employers are offering workers the option to stash their retirement savings in a Roth 401(k), but a Roth isn't the right choice for everyone.

Roth 401(k)s are similar to Roth individual retirement accounts, but they're managed in your employer plan. Just like a Roth IRA, you contribute money that has already been taxed so withdrawals, including any earnings, are tax-free.

About 50% of companies with 25,000 or more workers offer a Roth option in their 401(k)s, according to Fidelity Investments, which manages plans covering 11 million participants. Overall, 21% of employers in Fidelity plans offer a Roth option, up from 14% in 2008. Of the plans managed by  Charles Schwab

 for about 1.5 million participants, 56% of employers offer a Roth option, up from 26% in 2006.

If your employer adds a Roth option to your 401(k) plan, should you jump into it? The answer essentially comes down to one question: Will your taxes be higher or lower in retirement?

If you put $5,000 into a Roth 401(k) and $5,000 into a traditional 401(k), and earn the same return, you're going to be better off with the Roth when you retire (remember, you'll pay tax now on the $5,000 in the Roth) -- if your tax rate stays the same or rises.

But that's a big if. Income-tax rates are relatively low right now -- the current top rate is 35%, compared with 50% in 1986 and 91% in 1950, according to the Tax Policy Center. Many people assume lawmakers will increase rates in coming years, in part to help reduce the federal budget deficit. Then again, some lawmakers now are seeking to reduce tax rates.

To hedge against tax uncertainty, investors should consider tapping both a 401(k) and a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k), experts say.

Your own situation will affect your tax rate, too. In retirement "maybe they don't have a mortgage deduction anymore, or they have some money set aside in an IRA that, when they start taking money out, will push them into a higher tax bracket," says  Dave Gray, vice president of client experience at Charles Schwab, in Richfield, Ohio. "A Roth gives you an opportunity to hedge that bet."

Younger workers may be paying the lowest tax rate they'll ever pay, assuming their incomes rise as they age. In this scenario, paying taxes now on Roth contributions makes sense.

But people who expect to come up short on their savings may want to think twice about a Roth. If Social Security will provide the bulk of your income in retirement, for instance, your tax rate may well drop.

"People that are well prepared for retirement probably will be in a tax bracket that's at least as high as the one they're in when they're at work, if they use mechanisms like traditional 401(k)s," says  Thomas Warschauer, a certified financial planner and professor of finance at San Diego State University. Those who are ill-prepared for retirement "will probably be in a lower tax bracket, and, therefore, it will [be better to get] a tax deferral on the initial contribution."

If you've decided to go the Roth route, are you better off with an employer-sponsored Roth 401(k) or a Roth IRA?

Roth 401(k)s have some advantages over Roth IRAs, though lower-income savers are less likely to enjoy these perks. (You can invest in both types of Roths at the same time.)

For 2011, the maximum Roth IRA contribution is $5,000, or $6,000 if you're 50 or older. But you can put up to $16,500, or $22,000 if you're 50 or older, into a Roth 401(k). That total contribution is for both Roth and non-Roth options in your 401(k).

Also, there are income limits on who can contribute to a Roth IRA on a continuing basis, but those rules don't apply to Roth 401(k)s. In 2011, the limit for joint filers is modified adjusted gross income of $179,000. The maximum contribution amount is reduced for those with income of $169,000 or more. For single filers, it's $122,000 and the maximum contribution amount is reduced for those with modified adjusted gross income of $107,000 or more.

Employers can match Roth 401(k) contributions, but the employers' dollars must go into a pretax account, not the Roth, according to the Internal Revenue Service.

Under a new rule set last year, workers can convert their regular 401(k) to a Roth 401(k), if their employer allows this. (You'll owe income tax on the conversion.) But unlike a traditional Roth IRA conversion, you're not allowed to undo, or recharacterize, a Roth 401(k) conversion if you change your mind, says  Ed Slott, a certified public accountant and founder of IRAHelp.com.

One disadvantage of a Roth 401(k): At age 70[frac12] you'll need to start taking annual required minimum distributions. To avoid this, you can roll your Roth 401(k) into a Roth IRA before reaching that age.

You'll also probably enjoy a broader investment lineup in a Roth IRA. Still, investing in a Roth 401(k) may be cheaper if your employer enjoys institutional pricing, rather than the retail investor prices you'll pay through the IRA. "There may be some cost savings there for a participant in a Roth 401(k) versus an IRA," says Schwab's Mr. Gray.

A perk of both types of Roths: A person who inherits a Roth can spread the tax-free distributions over his or her lifetime. Spouses who inherit a Roth can roll the money into their own IRA and postpone distributions. (Check the rules for any tax issues.)
