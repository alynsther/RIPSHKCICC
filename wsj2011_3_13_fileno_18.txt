 Q: I read your recent article about getting a tax credit for having overpaid Social Security taxes. It was very informative. Is the credit new? If I overpaid for the last two or three years, can I still get back the excess amount I paid? If yes, how do I do it?

 A: No, this credit isn't new. And, yes, you probably can still get back the excess amount if you had too much in Social Security taxes withheld from your pay for the last two or three years.

Our reader is asking about a tax credit that is available to many taxpayers who worked for two or more employers in a year. If that includes you, you may have had too much in Social Security tax withheld from your pay.

To get the credit, you'll need to file what's known as an "amended" tax return for each year you qualify. Use Internal Revenue Service Form 1040X, "Amended U.S Individual Income Tax Return." It's available on the IRS website (www.irs.gov).

You also can use Form 1040X to fix any other mistakes or omissions on previous returns.

File a separate form for each tax year involved, the IRS says in Publication 17. You will have to mail it in; you can't file amended returns electronically.

Whatever the case, don't procrastinate. The general rule is you have to file a claim for a credit or refund within three years after the date you filed your original return, or within two years after the date you paid the tax, whichever is later.

For 2010, the maximum amount of Social Security taxes that should have been withheld was $6,621.60 (or 6.2% of $106,800). It was the same amount for 2009. For 2008, it was $6,324. However, all your wages are subject to Medicare withholding.

For more details, check out the Social Security Administration's website (www.ssa.gov).

In Publication 17, the IRS gave an example of a hypothetical taxpayer who worked for two employers last year. The first paid him $60,000 and withheld $3,720 (6.2% of $60,000) in Social Security tax. The second paid him $55,000 and withheld $3,410 in Social Security tax. Thus, the taxpayer had a total of $7,130 withheld, or $508.40 above the limit for that year. That taxpayer would be entitled to a tax credit of $508.40, according to the IRS.
