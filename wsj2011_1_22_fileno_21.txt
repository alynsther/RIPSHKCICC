MUMBAIâ€”Diversified Indian conglomerate Aditya Birla Group is in talks to buy U.S.-based carbon black manufacturer Columbian Chemicals Co., people familiar with the matter said.

Aditya Birla would pay $800 million in cash, the people said, without elaborating on whether there is a noncash component to the deal as well. The two companies "are in exclusive talks, and the deal is likely to close in the next two weeks," said one person.

Major Indian carbon black makers have been scouting for acquisitions in the Americas and Europe to expand their manufacturing and sales operations beyond Asia as they sell their products to global tire makers.

Carbon black is the basic material used to make tires. It is also a key raw material for plastics, inks and paints.

Media reports say that the Aditya Birla Group and Indian carbon black maker Phillips Carbon Black also are seeking to acquire the German company Evonik's carbon black division.
