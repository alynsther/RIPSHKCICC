MUMBAI â€“ Tata Steel Ltd. plans to launch its proposed 36.8 billion rupee ($813 million) follow-on public share offering on Jan. 19, three people involved in the transaction said Thursday, as the Indian steelmaker seeks to raise funds to lower its debt burden. 

The company earlier Thursday received the Registrar of Companies' final approval to offer 57 million shares, and it will hold media and analyst conferences on Monday to announce the sale, the people told Dow Jones Newswires on condition of anonymity. 

The offering will close on Jan. 21, they said. 

At the end of the quarter through September, the world's seventh-largest steelmaker by capacity had $10.7 billion of net debt, taken to part fund its $12 billion acquisition of Anglo-Dutch Corus in 2007 and local expansion. 

It recently refinanced GBP3.5 billion ($5.45 billion) of debt taken to fund the Corus buy, and has been looking to reduce the debt. 

Tata Steel is also expanding the capacity of its Indian facility, at Jamshedpur in eastern India, to 10.0 million metric tons a year from 6.8 million tons. The company, which has plants in Singapore, Thailand, the U.K., South Africa and the Netherlands, plans to build two more factories in India. 

Last month, Managing Director  Hemant Nerurkar said Tata Steel wants to reduce its debt-to-equity ratio to 2.5 from the currenitatat 2.8. 

It said in a regulatory filing on Monday that its board had approved a public issue of 57 million ordinary shares. 

The company's shares ended 1.8% down at 637.45 rupees, in line with the broader market. At that price, it could raise $803.2 million through the share sale, but new shares generally are sold at a discount.
