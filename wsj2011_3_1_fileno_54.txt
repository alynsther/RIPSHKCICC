Channing Frye hit a 3-pointer with 6.6 seconds left in overtime and the Phoenix Suns spoiled Deron Williams's home debut for the Nets on Monday night.

The Nets narrowly missed pulling this one out, but Kris Humphries tip-in of Williams's floater came a split second after the final buzzer. A review showed the ball on his right hand with the clock showing zeros. Williams had 13 points and a season-high 18 assists.
