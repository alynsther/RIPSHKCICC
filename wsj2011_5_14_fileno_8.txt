The man in his 60s complained that he wasn't feeling well when he was working inside a building for waste disposal in the early morning. 

He was unconscious and not breathing when he was taken to a doctor's room within the plant's premise. 

The death was later confirmed at a hospital. The worker, who belonged to a subcontracting firm, was on his second day of work at the complex. His exposure to radiation was 0.17 milisievert, which is within normal levels, and no radioactive contamination was found on his clothes, the spokesman for Tepco said. 

Since the quake and tsunami-induced crisis began March 11, two other workers have died at the facility, both believed to have drowned in the floodwaters as the 15-meter tsunami hit the plant. Their bodies were discovered April 3. 

Two workers have been injured through exposure to highly radioactive water while laying a cable at one of the units.
