He didn't elaborate.

In May 2008 Ranbaxy and Merck entered an agreement for the joint development of the drugs and the collaboration was initially for five years.

Ranbaxy was to receive an undisclosed up-front sum, with the potential to receive payments totaling more than $100 million associated with the achievement of various research, development and regulatory milestones for each target included in the collaboration.

Ranbaxy was also eligible to receive significant royalties on worldwide net sales of any products commercialized under the agreement.
