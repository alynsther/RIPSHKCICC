To be class clown at Murry Bergtraum High School in New York City took work. John Leguizamo spent two years trying to get a seat at the lunch table reserved for the funniest kids in school. "I made it by junior year," the 46-year-old performer said recently. "I used to write my jokes at night as soon as I got home. I wouldn't be doing my homework. I'd be writing jokes."

His latest Broadway solo show, "Ghetto Klown," which opens Tuesday, shows that smart-alecky kid grown up, sort of, on the movie and TV sets of Hollywood. Mr. Leguizamo, who has performed two autobiographical shows on Broadway before, "Freak" and "Sexaholix," returns to the subject of himself, this time with a look at his acting career and tales about some of the famous actors he's worked with in the past, including Al Pacino, Steven Seagal and Sean Penn. 

In the show, he mocks some of his fellow actors for their method-acting rituals and giant egos, but he said he's not concerned about getting ostracized by the industry as a result. "I don't worry about the Hollywood machine," he said. "It operates out of fear."

The Bogotá, Colombia-born comedian did change some names and details in the show, and said he removed some characters altogether during the out-of-town runs, sometimes due to legal threats. "I got calls from lawyers telling me to cease and desist on this person and that," he said. Attorneys told him he could mock someone if he was clearly expressing an opinion, not presenting an observation as fact, he said. "You're not a doctor," he said, "so you can't call somebody a psychopath." 

Mostly, though, Mr. Leguizamo affects the persona of a guy who doesn't care what anybody thinks, including sometimes even the audience. At a recent performance, he launched into a tale of an ill-fated boozy evening involving his future wife and an entire order of fried grasshoppers. The crowd moaned at the description of the dish. Unflustered, he fired back: "More for me."
