BANGALORE â€“ Indian drug maker Cipla Ltd. said Thursday its fourth-quarter net profit fell 22% from a year earlier, when it had a one-time gain from a brand sale. 

Net profit for the quarter through March slid to 2.14 billion rupees ($48.2 million) from 2.76 billion rupees, almost matching the 2.15 billion rupees average of estimates in a poll of seven analysts. 

Sales rose 23% to 16.15 billion rupees from 13.17 billion rupees. 

Cipla's earnings in the year-earlier period included 950 million rupees from the sale of its emergency contraceptive brand, i-pill, to Piramal Healthcare Ltd. Excluding the one-time gain, pre-tax profit was little changed at 2.51 billion rupees compared with 2.53 billion rupees. 

Net profit was weighed also by higher costs related to a new plant located in a special enclave enjoying tax breaks in Indore, central India. Costs associated with the commissioning of the new facility dragged Cipla's profit lower for a third consecutive quarter. 

Cipla, one of India's top four drug makers by sales, said total costs in the fourth quarter rose 23% to 14.37 billion rupees, pushed up by higher expenditure on materials, staff, depreciation and sales. 

Material costs as a percentage of sales rose about three percentage points from a year earlier, the company said. 

Staff costs climbed 31% to 1.31 billion rupees because of an increase in the number of employees, particularly in Indore, and wages. 

Depreciation costs jumped 41% to 696.5 million rupees, as the company accounted for fixed assets at the Indore plant. Factory and selling expenses pushed up other expenditure 7.6% to 4.37 billion rupees.

The company said that an unfavorable product mix during the quarter and costs associated with the new facility led to its operating margin contracting to 18.0% from 18.6%. 

Cipla's margins are typically hurt when the sales mix includes a higher proportion of anti-retroviral drugs as the company sells these HIV/AIDS treatments in poor countries at low prices. 

The company also said that local sales of finished drugs rose 15% to 6.52 billion rupees and exports climbed 28% to 9.75 billion rupees. Shipments of finished drugs grew 21% to 7.43 billion rupees while bulk-drug exports surged 59% to 2.32 billion rupees.

Other operating income--which includes fees to provide technology know-how for products and processes--slipped 5.6% to 539.8 million rupees. Technology fees soared 53% to 207.1 million rupees.

Cipla also dismissed speculation about its founders exiting the company. Rumors of a possible sellout have been swirling around Cipla for almost a decade now. The list of alleged suitors in the past includes  Pfizer Inc.

"During my lifetime there will be no sale of any Cipla stock to any foreign pharmaceutical company...or to a domestic company," Cipla's founding chairman, Y.K. Hamied, told television channel CNBC-TV18.
