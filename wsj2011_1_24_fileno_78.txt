Defenseman Michael Del Zotto, who was surprisingly sent down to the AHL earlier this month after he regressed in his sophomore season, is back with the Rangers after being recalled on Sunday. Mr. Del Zotto, 20, had five assists in his past four games while playing for the Connecticut Whale. The team also promoted forward Evgeny Grachev, who did not record a point in his first tour of duty in the NHL in November. The Rangers head to Washington to take on Alexander Ovechkin and the Capitals at 7:30 p.m. Monday.
