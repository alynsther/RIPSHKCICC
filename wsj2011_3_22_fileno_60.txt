Not only did top-seeded Kansas barely break a sweat in its win over Illinois on Sunday, but the bracket chaos around the Jayhawks has provided them with a road to the Final Four that looks remarkably easy—at least on paper.

Elsewhere in the Southwest region, No. 12 Richmond knocked off No. 13 Morehead State, No. 11 Virginia Commonwealth pounded Purdue and No. 10 Florida State throttled Notre Dame. Which means that if the Jayhawks make the Final Four—and with 1-to-3 odds, according to Bodog, they're the surest remaining bet—they will have done so without beating any team seeded better than ninth.

This potential path to the Final Four isn't unprecedented. Actually, it might not be the easiest road since 1985, when the NCAA tournament switched to 64 teams. In 2001, Michigan State cruised past a No. 16 seed, a No. 9 seed and a No. 12 seed before meeting a No. 11 seed with a Final Four berth on the line. If Kansas beats Richmond on Friday and plays VCU in the Elite Eight, it will follow the exact scenario as the Spartans. If the Jayhawks meet Florida State, the sum of their opponents' seeds would be 47, tying them with the 1991 North Carolina and 1990 UNLV squads. Of these three teams that waltzed to the national semifinals, only UNLV cut down the nets at the end of the season.

But then the Kansas faithful shouldn't let that stop them from rock-chalk-Jayhawking their way through the work week. The last time Kansas saw a path like this was 2008, when they took a 16-8-12-10 road to the Final Four and eventually went on to win the national title.
