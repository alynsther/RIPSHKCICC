, said it will hive off its 5.6-billion-rupee Chennai project division to raise cash.

The company on Monday, in a filing with the Bombay Stock Exchange, said its board approved of the move to sell the unit that includes its 387-room luxury hotel and residential projects in Chennai. 

The hotel chain, in an effort to cut out debt on its balance sheet, has opted to sell one project after the other. It, currently, has a total debt of 4.5 billion rupees, the company told PTI.

"Hiving off the Chennai project division will help reduce debt from the books of VHL," said Lenin Babu, company secretary, in a PTI report.

Earlier this month, its board of directors decided to hive-off the Bangalore project division for 2.05 billion rupees.

"Smaller companies that are not able to secure capital have to inevitably resort to such actions," said  Mr. Rajiv Sahni, partner in Ernst & Young's real estate practice.

Currently, developers find it easy to sell incomplete or partially completed projects, and use this as a way to raise cash to invest in the next project. 

Mr. Sahni cautioned against this habit, saying companies need to get "investors, channel money properly and strategize on how to reduce dependence on borrowings."

Viceroy Hotel's total turnover for 2009-10 fiscal was 566.5 million rupees. Shares of Viceroy closed today at 33.85 rupees per share on the Bombay Stock Exchange, up 0.74% from the previous close.
