  Starbucks Corp. unveiled a new logo Wednesday as it prepared to celebrate its 40th anniversary and focus on becoming more of a consumer packaged-goods company.

During a webcast meeting with baristas, the Seattle-based coffee giant showed off a simpler logo that no longer includes the green circle that says "Starbucks coffee." In addition, the mythological "siren" figure inside that circle is now larger. 

The updated logo reflects the company's new emphasis on selling Starbucks-brand products in supermarkets and other channels beyond its retail stores. 

"Even though we have been and always will be a coffee company and retailer, it's possible we'll have other products with our name on it and no coffee in it," Chief Executive  Howard Schultz said. He added that any noncoffee products Starbucks sells will adhere to the same standards the company applies to its coffee. "We're not going to put our name on things that dilute the quality of Starbucks," he said.
