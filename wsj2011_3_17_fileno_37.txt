 PLC's offer for Africa-focused coal producer  Riversdale Mining Ltd. continues to slowly draw acceptances since the bid was raised, taking it to more than 30% of the voting rights, the company said Wednesday. 

Rio Tinto last week lifted its offer to A$16.50 a share from A$16.00, valuing Riversdale at roughly A$4 billion. The bid is subject to Rio Tinto obtaining a more than a 50% interest by March 23.
