TORONTOâ€”The west coast of Canada appears to have been only mildly affected from the tsunami triggered by a Japanese earthquake Friday.

Initial reports from towns on Vancouver Island and other islands along the coast of British Columbia say there's been little change in water level or waves, after the first impact from the tsunami was scheduled to hit the shore. A tsunami advisory had been issued early Friday for three zones in coastal British Columbia, warning of the potential for strong currents that could affect marinas and other coastal infrastructure.

David McKenzie, emergency coordinator for the coastal city of Prince Rupert, near the Alaskan border, said his department had been put on alert but nothing appears to have happened so far. Keir Gervais, director of operations for the town of Port Alice on Vancouver Island, said the first wave had been expected to hit shortly after 6 a.m. Pacific time, but that all was quiet.

"We're keeping the advisory out there until we get the all-clear from the experts. People should still be cautious," says Susan Williams, spokeswoman for the British Columbia provincial emergency program. Still, "it's a non-event."

Meanwhile, Prime Minister Stephen Harper said the government was still watching for possible tsunami effects on the west coast. He also offered his "heartfelt condolences to the Japanese people'"and said he'd offered Canadian disaster-support assistance to the Japanese ambassador as well.
