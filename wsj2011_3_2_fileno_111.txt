When the Jets nabbed Vernon Gholston sixth overall in the 2008 NFL Draft, they were hoping for a dynamic pass rusher—one unseen in green and white since the days of the famed New York Sack Exchange in the early 1980s. Instead, they received a player who currently sits as perhaps the biggest defensive end bust in modern NFL history.

So reports this week of his impending release come as no surprise. What is shocking is that he never recorded a single sack, something no other defensive end drafted in the top 10 picks can claim since the league began officially tracking that statistic in 1982. 

Looking at the career records of other hugely disappointing defensive ends, the Jets have little reason to worry they ever will regret his release. The other four defensive end busts registered just 13 more sacks after their first three seasons, though one—Atlanta's Jamaal Anderson—is still active. And 11 of those were recorded by one player, former Giants fifth-overall pick Cedric Jones. Despite that late surge, Jones is routinely atop annual lists of the worst all-time Giants picks.

Does Gholston have that distinction for the Jets? Any Jets fan will tell you that the competition in this category is fierce. But it's tough to beat zero. Running back Blair Thomas (2nd overall in 1990) managed 2,009 Jets rushing yards. Johnny "Lam" Jones (2nd in 1980) earned the nickname "Lame" for his constant injuries, but he did manage to catch 138 passes. Dewayne Robertson (4th overall in 2003) started 75 games, albeit uneventfully. That's still 70 more than Gholston logged for Gang Green. 

Since 1982, here are the defensive ends picked in the top 10 of the NFL Draft who recorded the fewest number of sacks in their first three seasons.
