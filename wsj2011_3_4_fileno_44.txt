Casey Wellman, recalled from the minors hours earlier, broke a second-period tie with his second NHL goal and Jose Theodore made 40 saves for the Minnesota Wild, who beat New York on Thursday night as the Rangers finished their three-game homestand without a win.

Wellman was brought up on an emergency basis earlier in the day. 

Sean Avery scored the only goal for the Rangers—his third of the season. Henrik Lundqvist made 16 saves and allowed three goals.
