 Post 'It' Tote 

The motto of Switzerland's postal service—"for the most discerning customers in the world"—sounds more appropriate for a luxury brand than mail delivery. 

But it might work for this vintage-chic weekender made from an old Swiss Post mailbag, embellished with leather handles, metal feet and (of course) a stamp. Each is slightly different; a limited number is available. $184,  europeanmarket.us   

 Minibar for the Mind 

The School of Life, London's hip self-improvement enterprise, has created special add-ons for Morgans Hotels, including conversation-starting menus offered up at dinner, a series of talks on topics like reading and romance, and the Minibar for the Mind, a box packed with conversation cards, a book of essays, reading prescriptions, a noncheesy dream journal and more. $56, morganshotelgroup.com  

 Food Fest West 

Only while in a deep food coma can most of us chow lobster rolls while teeing off against Iron Chef Masaharu Morimoto. But those willing to shell out $1,000 can play in the Celebrity Chef Golf Tournament at the fourth annual Pebble Beach Food & Wine festival, from April 28 to May 1. 

The four-day foodie fling also includes events like an intimate lunch with Food Network chef Guy Fieri, a master class in sustainable seafood with the Monterey Bay Aquarium and a star-chef prepared dinner paired with Krug Champagnes. From $100 for a single event to $4,750 for an all-inclusive V.I.P. pass, pebblebeachfoodandwine.com
