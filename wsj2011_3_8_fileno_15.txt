Jeron Belin scored 17 points and St. Peter's beat Iona Monday to win the MAAC championship and secure the school's first NCAA tournament berth in 16 years. Michael Glover had 23 points for Iona, which came in averaging almost 80 points per game. Scott Machado added 15 and Rashon Dwight added 10. The Gaels trailed by as many as 12 in the second half before mounting a furious late comeback that fell short. Iona's 57 points were a season low, two below the 59 they had in a two-point loss to Rider in January.
