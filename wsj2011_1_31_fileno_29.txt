As Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak struggles to reassert control over protesters and wider unrest across the country, international shippers said Monday they are bracing for delays in the Suez Canal, a critical trade route, through which about 8% of global sea-borne trade makes it way.

Oil markets are particularly nervous about any disruption to Suez Canal shipping. While the canal is too narrow for some of the petroleum industry's biggest tankers, Egypt sees as much as a million barrels of oil a day travel fromthe oil rich Middle East to the Mediterranean through the canal. Another 1.1 million barrels makes it on the same northward journey via the Suez-Mediterranean pipeline. Together the flows account for about 2% of global oil output.

On Sunday, canal authority officials said operations were normal. Shippers over the weekend and early Monday said traffic was still moving, but they have warned of possible delays. 

"Operations are running as before,"  Hans Christian Aagaard, investor relations manager at international shipper Maersk, said Monday. He said that operations are affected by the fact that the government has shut down communications networks.

According to Mr. Aagaard, this is likely to create some delays on the terminal operations as it takes extra time for the ships to load and unload containers. Usually the ships and the company's terminal communicate via the internet. Now that communication has to take place physically as the ship docks which means the loading and unloading potentially takes extra time. 

A curfew and general unrest has made office hours across Egypt erratic. Over the weekend, another large shipper warned customers that delays were possible as it expected difficulty in contacting pilots, arranging for crew swaps and reprovisioning.
