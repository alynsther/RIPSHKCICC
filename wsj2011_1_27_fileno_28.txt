LONDONâ€”U.K. retail-sales growth slowed in January and is expected to continue to decelerate, a survey showed Thursday, adding to the signs of weakness in the British economy. 

The Confederation of British Industry's sales-volume balance fell to +37 in January from +56 in December, the weakest reading in three months. The balance is the percentage of respondents reporting higher sales than in the corresponding period the previous year minus the percentage reporting weaker sales. 

With consumer confidence low amid government spending cuts and a rise in the sales tax that came into force on Jan. 4, retailers expect sales to slow further. The balance of sales expected for February was +25, the survey showed.

"Consumer demand is expected to be weak in the coming months, as the spending power of households is hit by a combination of sharply rising prices and weak wage growth," said  Ian McCafferty, chief economic adviser to the CBI. "Retailers can expect a challenging period ahead."

Thursday's figures are being closely watched by the market because it they are the first to be released since Tuesday's news that gross domestic product shrank in the fourth quarter of 2010. They are also the first figures since the publication Wednesday of the minutes from Bank of England's January meeting, which showed Monetary Policy Committee member  Martin Weale joined fellow member  Andrew Sentance in voting for a rise in the bank's key interest rate. 

The CBI surveyed 126 firms between Jan. 4 and Jan. 18.
