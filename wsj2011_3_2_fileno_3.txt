DETROIT—The home of the North American International Auto Show is getting a major face lift, with expanded floor space and riverfront vistas, according to plans unveiled by a regional authority charged with improving the aging facility.

The plans call for a three-year, $221 million renovation of Cobo Conference and Exhibition Center, financed by bonds. Wednesday's announcement came after years of complaints from auto makers that the downtown facility was too small and dilapidated to host the industry's annual January showcase.

The adjacent Cobo Arena—a storied sports and concert venue where Mayor Dave Bing once played professional basketball—will be converted into a 40,000-square-foot ballroom, and a three-story atrium will connect the center's main floor to a new entrance facing the Detroit River. Cobo's front facade will be remade with a digital "media mesh" billboard to announce the latest conventioneers.

The project is expected to be largely completed by the January 2014 auto show. The 2.4 million-square-foot facility was last updated in 1989.

Control of Cobo shifted to a regional authority in 2009 under a long-term lease with the city, after show organizers threatened to pull out of the venue amid a political debate over funding its future needs.
