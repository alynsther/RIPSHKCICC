Italian motorcycle maker Ducati unveiled its Monster 1100 EVO, the latest iteration of the long-running and top-selling Monster series. While the new bike is the first Ducati with an air-cooled engine to put out 100 horsepower, what makes it stand out are safety features rarely found on basic, so-called naked street bikes.

The Monster 1100EVO comes with what Ducati calls its Safety Pack, which is a combination of adjustable traction control and anti-lock brakes. While some motorcycle makers,  BMW

 in particular, have offered anti-lock brakes for years, the feature is still relatively rare on bikes compared with cars. 

Traction control has been cropping up on exotic racing-style sport bikes for the past few years but hasn't taken of throughout the market. Like the anti-lock brakes, it has been widely available on cars for years and is increasingly installed as standard equipment. Together the safety features help prevent motorcyclists from losing control and crashing due to skidding or unexpectedly spinning their rear wheels.

When Ducati unveiled the first Monster in 1993 the idea of such electronic safety gear would have seemed far-fetched on a bike whose charm resided mainly in its stripped-down, elemental styling. The safety system is standard on the new bike, which costs $11,995 in the U.S., and reflects the gradual change in riders' expectations concerning safety and the value of electronic aids in accident avoidance.
