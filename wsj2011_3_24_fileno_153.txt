The Food and Drug Administration said over-the-counter heartburn drugs such as Prevacid and Prilosec don't appear to be associated with an increased chance of fractures and scrapped plans to update the drug labels to warn consumers of such a risk. 

Last year, the agency said so-called proton-pump inhibitors, which suppress acid in the stomach, might be associated with an increased risk of hip, wrist and spine fractures, and said new warnings would be placed on prescription and over-the-counter products. 

On Wednesday, however, the FDA said the increased fracture risk is unlikely with over-the-counter versions of the drugs, which use lower doses than prescription products. Proton-pump inhibitors make up the third-biggest-selling class of drugs in the U.S.

"In contrast to prescription PPIs, [over-the-counter] PPIs are marketed at low doses and are only intended for a 14-day course of treatment up to three times per year," the FDA said in a statement posted on its website. 

The agency said it recognizes that consumers may take over-the-counter products for longer periods of time or at higher doses than stated on the label and said doctors should be aware of the fracture risk. 

Prescription proton-pump inhibitors such as  AstraZeneca PLC's Nexium are meant to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease, stomach and small-intestine ulcers, and inflammation of the esophagus. Drugs such as Prilosec, Zegerid, and Prevacid are sold in over-the-counter versions for the treatment of frequent heartburn. 

Some studies have suggested a modest increase in fracture risk, particularly when a PPI drug is used for one year or more or at high doses. One theory is that suppressing stomach acid might interfere with the absorption of calcium.
