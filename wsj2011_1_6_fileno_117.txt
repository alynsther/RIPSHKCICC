ZURICH—Barcelona has topped a global list of clubs receiving compensation from FIFA for letting their players go to the 2010 World Cup.

Barcelona received $866,000 (€660,000) from a FIFA pool of $40 million spread among 400 clubs in 55 countries, according to FIFA figures released Thursday.

Bayern Munich got $778,000 and Chelsea was third with $762,000. "We are pleased that we can share the success of the 2010 FIFA World Cup with the clubs by providing them a share of the benefits of our flagship event," FIFA President Sepp Blatter said in a statement.

FIFA earned broadcasting and commercial revenues of around $3.4 billion in its four-year financial cycle leading up to the tournament in South Africa. The governing body's profits are scheduled to be announced in March when its annual financial report is published.

English clubs were best rewarded in the scheme, sharing a combined $5.95 million. German clubs were next receiving $4.74 million.

World Cup winner Spain was fourth on the list as its clubs shared $3.7 million. The Spanish federation got $30 million from a separate FIFA prize pot for victory.

The payments were based on a rate of $1,600 per player per day, starting two weeks before games began in South Africa. The meter stopped running the day after each player's last match.

Money earned from each player's participation was divided among clubs he represented from 2008-10. Compensation was agreed in a 2008 peace deal between FIFA, UEFA and European clubs which saw them drop lawsuits for players being injured on international duty.

Barcelona topped the table after sending 13 players to the World Cup, including seven with champions Spain.

Bayern Munich's contingent included seven with semi-finalist Germany, plus Netherlands pair Arjen Robben and Mark van Bommel who reached the final.

Chelsea sent 13 players from six different countries, though none reached the quarter-final stage.

Another English club, Liverpool, was fourth-best rewarded with $695,600 and Real Madrid was next, getting $678,133.

Payments applied only to players who were selected in one of the 32 teams' 23-man squad for the tournament. Clubs whose players appeared in qualifying matches did not share in the cash.

The compensation scheme debuted at the 16-team 2008 European Championship when UEFA then distributed $55 million.

Germany's Werder Bremen then received $1.39 million to top the list of 180 clubs from 24 different countries receiving payments.

FIFA said it has allocated $70 million in compensation for clubs whose players go to the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. It has budgeted for $3.8 billion of commercial income in the next cycle.

Despite the peace agreement, European clubs are not satisfied with their share of World Cup cash. Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, who leads the European Club Association lobby group, said last September that FIFA should fund an insurance policy helping clubs cover the wages of players injured on international duty.

Bayern star Mr. Robben has not played for the German champions since returning from the July 11 final with a hamstring injury.

Mr. Rummenigge said FIFA's scheme earned Bayern around $70,000 for Robben—enough to cover a few days' basic pay.
