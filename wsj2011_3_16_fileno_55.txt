The Indian Ministry of Corporate Affairs recently notified that it had converged 35 Indian accounting standards with international guidelines.

This is an important first step in bringing International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) to India, and making Indian companies' financial statements comparable to that of their global peers.

However, several deviations of the proposed Indian standards from international practices have raised concerns among investors. Further, the lack of a clear timeline that spells out the final implementation date is another cause of worry. The delay in notification of the effective dates has created renewed uncertainty about a further extension of implementation beyond April 1 this year, (the originally planned date for certain large companies).But the bigger issue lies with the deviations.

The first set of deviations is requirements in the Indian standards that conflict with IFRS requirements. These include:

* Revenue recognition for real-estate sales on the basis of percentage completion method (IFRS generally requires revenue recognition when the final possession is given to the customer)

* Accounting for the equity-conversion option of a foreign currency convertible bond as an 'equity' component (IFRS requires the foreign-currency-based equity conversion option to be periodically marked to market).

There are some other, less substantive, mandatory deviations (for example, use of a government bond rate as opposed to corporate bond rates for discounting employee-benefit obligations).

The second category of deviations represent areas where a company can either elect to align with IFRS principles, or choose alternative policies that deviate from international standards. Some of these options include:

* Deferring exchange differences on long-term foreign-currency monetary assets and liabilities, and recognizing such differences over the period of the underlying asset/liability (IFRS requires all such differences to be immediately recognized in the profit-and-loss account)

* Considering Indian GAAP carrying values as 'deemed cost' for fixed assets acquired prior to transition date (IFRS offers no such choice on transition)

* Eliminating IFRS principles relating to embedded leases and service-concession arrangements for an initial period

The option to choose these and other deviations may impair the ability of Indian companies to access overseas capital markets, or to align their financial reports with that of their multinational parent companies.

Regulators need to keep up the momentum and carry on with necessary changes to existing laws. For instance, regulatory amendments are needed to address the impact of the new accounting standards on distributable profits and taxation, and to ensure that it's aligned with the Indian Companies Act.

The advance notice on the changes will help companies start shifting to the new financial reporting system. Companies need to weigh the costs and benefits of selecting accounting policies that deviate from international standards. Finally, a notification from the regulators on the implementation date would help all stakeholders take the next step.
