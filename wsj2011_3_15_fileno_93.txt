As one door swings shut for journeyman Sergio Mitre, another is opening for young Manny Banuelos. 

Mitre, a long shot to make the Yankee rotation, suffered a further setback Monday when he was scratched from his nationally televised start against the Boston Red Sox with a back strain. 

To take Mitre's place, the Yankees settled on Banuelos, the lefty phenom with limitless confidence who turned 20 on Sunday. 

For Banuelos, it is a test on a big stage, but also a testament to the faith the Yankees have in the Mexican native. 

"I waited until today to make sure that's what we wanted to do," manager Joe Girardi said before the game. "The Red Sox. ESPN. It's something....Even if he gets too hyped up, that's something that he can learn from." 

But under the spotlight, Banuelos blossomed. He let a few runners reach base but clamped down every time to hold a Red Sox lineup full of All-Stars scoreless over 2.2 innings. 

General Manager Brian Cashman has made it clear Banuelos will not start the season in the majors and is ticketed for Double-A. Yet if he progresses as expected, he could see the majors as a matchup lefty this summer. 

For Mitre, a chance to shine is now wasted. With Bartolo Colon and Freddy Garcia throwing surprisingly well, and Ivan Nova establishing himself, Mitre is on track to be the odd man out despite a strong spring.
