FRANKFURTâ€”German producer prices continued to spiral higher in December, as energy prices propelled the headline index to its fastest annual increase since late 2008. 

Producer prices rose 0.7% from a month earlier and increased 5.3% from a year earlier, the Federal Statistics Office said Thursday. This was above an average forecast increase of 0.5% from a month earlier and 5.1% from a year earlier. 

The year-to-year increase in December is the highest since October 2008, when it rose by 7.3%, Destatis said. 

The statistics office said "energy price increases had the biggest impact on the annual rate" in December 2010. Excluding highly volatile energy prices, producer prices rose 0.5% on the month in December and increased by 3.6% on the year, Destatis said. 

In November, producer prices increased by 0.2% from a month earlier and 4.4% year-to-year.
