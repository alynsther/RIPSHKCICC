In dropping three straight games to a Cleveland Cavaliers team that's on pace for just 16 wins, the Knicks are setting the NBA standard for futility against a futile team.

Only one other club in league history has been swept over at least three games by an opponent with 20 or fewer wins. But those 1997-98 Grizzlies actually won fewer games (19) than the team that swept them—the 20-win Mavericks. After Friday's latest wrenching loss to Cleveland, the Knicks still are above .500 and have a seemingly large enough cushion to secure a playoff spot for the first time since 2001.

But versus the beleaguered Cavs, who had a 12-49 record through Saturday, New York looks as hapless as at any time during this post-Patrick Ewing era. Friday night, a comedy of errors erased a 12-point lead with just under seven minutes remaining. New York turned the ball over twice in the final two minutes on offensive fouls, both by Carmelo Anthony—the final one as he attempted to drive for a tying basket in the final seconds.

The Knicks are 18-8 against losing teams, which includes home losses to the Cavs, Warriors, Kings and Clippers. Those teams are a combined 24-95 on the road. 

The good news is that the Knicks get another chance to beat Cleveland in New York next month. Or maybe that's the bad news. Even with a win, New York will have fared worse versus the Cavs than the 2004-05 Pistons and 2009-10 Bulls did versus the Bobcats (18-64) and Nets (12-70), respectively. Detroit shrugged that off to not only make the playoffs but reach the Finals. With another loss to Cleveland, the Knicks may turn from wondering why they are making their postseason journey more difficult to worrying about whether they'll make it there at all.
