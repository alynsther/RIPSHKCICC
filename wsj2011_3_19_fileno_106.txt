  Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia, Thursday through Aug. 7  

Fifty years after beginning her career as an artist, Sheila Hicks is finally getting the first major retrospective of her sculptures made from fiber. An American who has lived in Paris since 1964, her works range from small weavings to a 20-foot-high sculpture suspended from the ceiling.



  Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, Sunday through May 30  Giovanni Paolo Panini's "Ancient Rome," seen in a detail, is a kind of 1757 tour of Rome's sights, painted for a count (shown toward the bottom with a guidebook). It's part of "Antiquity Revived," a look at the past-obsessed Neoclassical movement. Paris's Louvre has provided some of the 150 works.



  Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, Tuesday through Jan. 2   The exhibition's title is taken from Neil Young's song "After the Gold Rush," with its contrast of a romanticized past with a grim present and uncertain future (as the museum puts it). These 25 photos by 15 contemporary artists include the 1991 "Walking Gun" (pictured here) by Laurie Simmons.
