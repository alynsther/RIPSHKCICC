TRENTONâ€”Gov. Chris Christie was expected Tuesday night to formally fight a federal effort to reclaim $271 million from a scrapped Hudson River tunnel project, filing legal papers just in time to meet a midnight deadline.

The state must either send Washington $271 million or file a formal appeal over the federal demand for reimbursement. 

  Michael Drewniak, a spokesman for Mr. Christie, said lawyers for New Jersey will respond by the midnight Tuesday deadline. 

Federal authorities say the state owes it for engineering and construction work done on the tunnel before Mr. Christie canceled the project in October. 

Experts said New Jersey homeowners who lived near NJ Transit stations could have seen a bump in their property values thanks to easier access to Manhattan via the new tunnel. 

But Mr. Christie said New Jersey was going to have to foot too much of the bill for the project, including any costs above the $8.7 billion budget.

The governor, a Republican who has slashed state spending, said the unbudgeted costs could have added up to between $2 billion and $5 billion. 

At the time, it was the most expensive public works project in the country. The tunnel, known as the Access to the Region's Core project, was intended to double the capacity for trains traveling between New York City and New Jersey, routes that are now close to capacity and frequently delayed. 

The Christie administration so far has resisted paying the back the federal government, and hired a law firm known for lobbying to try to get out of the bill. 

The federal government says $128 million would be credited back to the state to ease traffic jams once the state pays in full.
