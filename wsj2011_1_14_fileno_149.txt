Memo to New York Jets owner Woody Johnson: With all due respect to your head coach Rex Ryan, you should offer a job to the recently unemployed Eric Mangini. He would immediately assume the newly created, unique position of Vice President of Patriots Affairs. 

It's a small but vital portfolio that Mr. Mangini, a former Patriots defensive coordinator, has excelled at during his otherwise unspectacular head coaching career. While the Patriots are 37-7 at Gillette Stadium since 2006, they are just 2-2 at home against Mr. Mangini. During the four seasons when Mr. Mangini's teams played his former employer, the Patriots were 57-13 (81.4%) but just 5-3 (62.5%) against Mr. Mangini's vastly inferior troops, including the 2006-08 Jets (23-26) and the 2010 Browns (5-11). The Browns also handed the Patriots their lone spanking this season, a 34-14 drubbing in November. 

In some cases, Mr. Mangini's squads were even impressive when they lost. In 2007, when New England went 16-0, the team averaged 37 points and 411 yards per game, including 296 in the air. In the second Jets-Patriots matchup that year—at New England—the Patriots managed just 20 points, including a single offensive touchdown. Tom Brady passed for just 140 yards with no touchdowns. He threw 50 in his other 15 games that season.

To be sure, what stands out for most Jets sufferers is the 37-16 playoff loss after the 2006 season. But the Jets pulled to within a touchdown early in the fourth before New England scored two late touchdowns and pulled away. That still beats losing 45-3.
