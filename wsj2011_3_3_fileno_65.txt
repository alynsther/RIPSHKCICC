Blake Comeau scored two goals, Al Montoya made 33 saves in non-taxing fashion, and the New York Islanders beat the sluggish Minnesota Wild on Wednesday night.

Comeau, who had gone seven games without scoring, gave the Islanders a 1-0 lead in the first period and a 3-0 edge in the second. Kyle Okposo and Andrew MacDonald added goals as New York dealt the playoff-hopeful Wild a serious blow.

Niklas Backstrom lasted only until 41 seconds into the second period. He was yanked in favor of Jose Theodore after giving up three goals on 19 shots. Theodore cleaned up for the Wild, who were outshot 41-34.
