Managers at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, deciding they need more time to replace and retest a fuse box, have delayed space shuttle Endeavour's launch by at least two days, to May 10 at the earliest, NASA said in a statement.

Blast off for the planned two-week mission to the international space station was scrubbed last Friday due to the electrical problem.

President Barack Obama and Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, wife of Endeavour commander Mark Kelly and who was struck down by a bullet earlier this year, were at the Kennedy Space Center to watch the launch.

Over the weekend, the NASA announced that the next launch wouldn't occur before May 8. 

On Monday, NASA officials decided they needed more time to complete the repair work and announced the next possible launch date was May 10. But the agency said a final date won't be set until the end of this week, based on progress completing the fixes. 

The work is complicated by the fact that the malfunctioning part is hard for technicians to reach, and NASA intends to conduct various tests to ensure that the replacement part has no problems. 

Endeavour is poised for its final voyage before NASA ends the space-shuttle program this summer, with the final launch now slated for July.
