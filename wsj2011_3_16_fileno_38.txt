PARIS—French Foreign Minister  Alain Juppé said Wednesday that several Arab countries are ready to take an active role in a military operation against Libya's strongman Col. Moammar Gadhafi.

"Only the threat of using force can stop Gadhafi," Mr. Juppé said on his official blog. "Several Arab countries have assured us that they would take part." Mr Juppé didn't name any particular Arab country. His office confirmed the contents of the blog.

France is struggling to rally support for its idea of fast-tracking a military operation, however small, against Col. Gadhafi. 

On Tuesday, Russian Foreign Minister  Sergei Lavrov said Moscow wouldn't make a decision on such action before it had heard more "concrete information" from Arab countries on what anti-Gadhafi action they would support.

"We are waiting for additional ideas," Mr. Lavrov told reporters in Paris after a meeting with Mr. Juppé and other top diplomats from the Group of Eight leading industrialized nations.

Last week, the Arab League called on the United Nations to enforce a "no-fly zone'' over Libyan airspace.

As the rebel movement is all but crushed in Libya, Mr. Juppé said it was "urgent" to find ways to effectively support opposition to Col. Gadhafi.

Mr. Juppé said it was "not enough" to proclaim that Mr. Gadhafi must go. "We must find ways to efficiently help those who took arms to fight against his dictatorship," he said.
