PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla.—Mets outfielder Carlos Beltran tested his tendinitis-ridden left knee on Wednesday, playing catch and taking a round of soft-toss batting practice. But under orders from the Mets, Beltran, a switch-hitter, only batted right-handed so he wouldn't put unnecessary strain on his left knee. Beltran, who hasn't appeared in a spring-training game since March 6, said the pain in his knee is "50% of what it was a week ago. It's not going to be 100% yet because tendinitis doesn't get cured in a week." He added he still had no timeline for his return to the Mets' lineup.

TAMPA, Fla.—For the first time Wednesday, the Yankees trotted out their likely opening day lineup. As usual, Derek Jeter led off, followed by Nick Swisher, Mark Teixiera, Alex Rodriguez and Robinson Cano. Jorge Posada the full-time DH hits sixth, followed by Curtis Granderson and new addition Russell Martin, and then Brett Gardner in the ninth hole. Girardi hinted that he might experiment with the batting order a little before opening day. "We might do some different things in the next two weeks,'' Girardi said.

A month after promising employees there would be no salary cuts or furloughs in the event of a lockout, Giants co-owner John Mara (below) said he wouldn't be tight-fisted with the team's fans either. Speaking on radio station WFAN Thursday, Mara said the Giants would not raise ticket prices this year, and that Giants' season-ticket holders would not be required to pay anything toward their tickets until a new labor agreement is reached between the NFL's owners and players. In normal years, full season ticket payment is due May 1.
