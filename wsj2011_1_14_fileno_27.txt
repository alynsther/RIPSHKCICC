American League saves leader Rafael Soriano and the Yankees have agreed on a three-year contract that could be worth $35 million to the free-agent reliever, a person familiar with the negotiations told The Associated Press.

The person spoke on condition of anonymity Thursday because the deal has not been finalized. Mr. Soriano must pass a physical to complete the contract.

The deal allows Mr. Soriano to opt out after his first or second season with the Yankees. He's likely to become the primary setup man for closer Mariano Rivera, who recently signed a two-year deal for $30 million.

Mr. Taylor' won't face jail time, but he'll be put on probation for six years and have to register as a sex offender. 

Mr. Taylor admitted to having sex with an underage girl prior to the arrest. He said he believed the girl, who was a runaway 16-year-old, was of consenting age. He'll be sentenced March 22.
