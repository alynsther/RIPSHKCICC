BERLIN—U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said Tuesday that he was impressed by the steps European leaders are taking toward "enormously difficult" reforms in the wake of the euro zone's debt crisis, adding he was confident that they would help stabilize the currency bloc. 

"I come away from these discussions convinced as I have been for some time that the European authorities understand what it's going to take and how to make sure that they maintain the right balance between support for the reform programs that are necessary...but also the type of financial support necessary to make those reform programs work," Mr. Geithner said after meeting here with German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble. 

Earlier Tuesday he met with European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet and German Bundesbank President Axel Weber. 

Mr. Geithner said he had no advice for European leaders ahead of their meeting in Brussels Friday and several more summits before the end of the month.

"No one understands these challenges and the complexity of how to solve them better than the leaders of Europe," he said. 

Messrs. Geithner and Schäuble also discussed global efforts to impose "a strong set of sanctions" on the regime of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, Mr. Geithner said, as well as sanctions against Iran for its failure to meet international obligations.
