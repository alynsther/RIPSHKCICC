Nathan Gerbe snapped a tie early in the third period with a power-play goal to lift the Buffalo Sabres over the Islanders on Sunday.

Mr. Gerbe finished a three-way passing play to score the winner 1:48 into the final period Sunday, as New York was unable to beat Buffalo for the third time in nine days—the Islanders had topped the Sabres 5-3 on Jan. 15 and then again 5-2 on Jan. 21. 

Rick DiPietro stopped 18 of 22 shots for the Isles, who fell to 15-25-7 on the season.
