Sculpture is one of the less portable art forms, and it's no wonder that many master sculptors have also been sublime cameramen. The most sublime was Constantin Brancusi, who assembled his works and materials into telling tableaux. His seminal images are evoked in David Smith's 1953 photograph (above) of his studio in upstate New York. The greatest of American sculptors, Smith liked that photography let him set his sculptures into contrasting contexts— the 'Tanktotems' on a dock in Lake George, the 'Ravens' framed against a blue sky—and to insist on the viewer's vantage and distance. Photography flattens sculpture and stills its spatial violence, but Smith found that it also exposed new aspects of what he called the 'illusion of form.' His photographic process is explored by Sarah Hamill in a brief but illuminating chapter of 'David Smith Invents' (Yale University Press, 101 pages, $30). It shows how, in Smith's hands, photography was simply sculpture by other means.
