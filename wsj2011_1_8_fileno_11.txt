Chef  Vinny Lauria of 208  Duecento Otto is a self-proclaimed "nerd" when it comes to pizza. He studies every pie with the precision of a scientist and obsession of a comic-book collector.

But his aim is a genuine Naples-style pie, and the standards of l'Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana (Association for Real Neapolitan Pizza) — think of it as the Italian pizza police — are most exacting. Mr. Lauria's signature slice is the D.O.C., named after the Italian quality label denominazione di origine controllata, which is awarded for excellence in regional food and modeled after the French appellation d'origine contrôlée (A.O.C.) system.
