Qatar became the first Arab nation to join international action against Col. Moammar Gadhafi, saying Sunday that it was sending fighter jets to Libya to help enforce a United Nations resolution aimed at preventing the Libyan strongman from using force against his own people.

In a statement issued by Qatar's state news agency, the Gulf Arab nation said it would help enforce a no-fly zone over Libya.

The U.S., France and other members of the international coalition that are conducting airstrikes against Col. Gadhafi's forces have said that explicit support—and possible contribution—by Arab nations to the effort would be crucial to avoiding the perception that Libya could become the center of yet another clash between the West and an Arab, Islamic nation.

The French Defense Ministry said on Sunday that it expected four Qatari Mirage 2000 jets to fly over Libya.

The four Qatari jets will have autonomous command and support but will fly jointly with French aircraft, Defense Ministry spokesman Laurent Teisseire said Sunday.
