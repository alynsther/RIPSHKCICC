While the Rainforest Alliance honored real environmental-defense efforts at its 20th anniversary gala at the American Museum of National History, some guests were better known for fighting fictional rainforest problems.

Sigourney Weaver, who has played both gorilla-defending zoologist Dian Fossey and a nature-protecting scientist in "Avatar," walked the green carpet at the event, which raised $1.5 million. Ms. Weaver said the roles spurred her interest in protecting the environment. "As earthlings, we all need to work together," she said. "I've done enough science fiction to know that anyone with one head, two arms and two legs needs to help each other."

Just over a year ago, the director James Cameron called her from Brazil to tell her about "a real-life "Avatar" situation" unfolding there. He described Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff's plans to build the Belo Monte dam in the Amazon rainforest, Ms. Weaver said. "I don't think President Dilma has seen 'Avatar,' " she said. "I'd be happy to sit and watch it with her."
