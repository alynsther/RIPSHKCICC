After five weeks, 42 games and just a few upsets—mostly involving England—the Cricket World Cup finally gets to crunch time with the start of the quarterfinals Wednesday.

There are now just seven matches left, which means that from a purely mathematical point of view, the tournament is more than 90% over. 

Waqar Younis disagrees. Ahead of its opening playoff game against West Indies in Mirpur, India on Wednesday, the Pakistan coach said, "It's pleasing to reach the knockout stage, but I must say the real World Cup starts with the quarterfinals."

South Africa has emerged as the favorite to lift the World Cup in Mumbai on April 2 after five wins in six matches secured the leading position in Group B and a winnable quarterfinal against New Zealand on Friday.

Pakistan has also seen its price shorten from 9/1 to 6/1 after winning Group A with a 5-1 record behind the inspirational leadership of all-rounder Shahid Afridi, the tournament's leading wicket-taker with 17 dismissals. His performances have helped Pakistan emerge as a realistic contender and a likely semifinalist after being drawn against West Indies. 

Sri Lanka, the 11/2 third-favorite with Unibet, is also expected to reach the last four after being paired with the wildly inconsistent English.

India, the pre-tournament favorite, faces a tough test when it plays host to Australia at Ahmedabad on Thursday, but, with homefield advantage, India, the tournament's leading run-scorer, is worth backing at around 7/2 to lift the trophy.
