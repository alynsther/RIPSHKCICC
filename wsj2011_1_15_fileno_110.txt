So-called socially responsible mutual funds are dabbling more in emerging markets—but the marriage might not be easy.

With the launch of its "socially responsible investment" fund, MMA Praxis Mutual Funds is the latest firm seeking to piggyback on the demand for emerging-market securities from investors. 

But socially responsible funds tend to have strict criteria that are incompatible with many emerging markets. SRI funds with environmental criteria, for example, will likely have a harder time finding appropriate companies in China, where environmental regulations are much looser, says  David Kathman, an analyst at  Morningstar Inc. 

In addition, just finding out whether companies match social screens is a major challenge, as companies in developing economies typically provide less disclosure about their finances, let lone other practices. 

"Disclosure tends to be not as good, and that makes it tough to be sure that things are socially responsible," Mr. Kathman says. 

In order to accommodate clients' personal values and the demand for emerging-market returns, SRI funds may have to make compromises—and do extra legwork—analysts say. 

  MMA Praxis International Index Fund, which hopes for 20% emerging-market exposure, aims to screen out the worst companies, but it can't expect every single requirement to be met, says  Chad Horning, MMA Praxis chief of investment. The fund screens for companies that produce tobacco, alcohol and weapons as part of its criteria. 

"We also understand that we have a mandate to be productive from an investor point of view," says Mr. Horning.
