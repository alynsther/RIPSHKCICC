If your team is lucky enough to possess the NBA's leading scorer, the logical move would be to have him do the bulk of the shooting come playoffs.

The Oklahoma City Thunder is apparently not interested in logic. Despite being teammates with the standing NBA scoring leader—Kevin Durant—Russell Westbrook has led the Thunder with 199 shots this postseason. That's 12 more field-goal attempts than Durant. If this holds, he will become only the third player in NBA history to pull off such an unusual feat. 

The last NBA-leading scorer to take a backseat to a teammate in the playoffs was Denver's Alex English in 1983. Kiki Vandeweghe outshot English 160 to 150. However, the Nuggets' shooting distribution was barely noteworthy due to the fact that Vandeweghe finished that season as the league's second-leading scorer. Westbrook was 13th, with 21.9 points per game versus 27.7 for Durant. The only other time this occurred was in 1957 when Neil Johnston outshot "Pitchin'" Paul Arizin for the Philadelphia Warriors. But their postseason lasted only two games that year, during which Arizin mustered 22 total minutes.

Westbrook is known as a point guard with an itchy trigger finger. But he's taking this to uncharted levels in the series versus Memphis, as he hoisted a staggering 33 shots in Game 4. If the Thunder hopes to stave off the Grizzlies (the series is tied 2-2), it may want to get the ball to Durant more often. Westbrook is shooting at a worse clip than Durant (40.2% to 46.5%) this playoffs, and in the team's three losses, Westbrook's shot advantage is even more drastic (75 to 63).
