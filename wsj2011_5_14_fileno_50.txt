Picture it: Mid-July, a breeze-nipped evening soiree on the patio. Drinks are flowing, bossa nova's streaming from your fancy outdoor speakers. Now where is everyone gonna sit? What you need are big, plush yet not-too-sinky floor cushions, the kind of perches that fabulous types scatter about at poolside parties. What you need are Roche Bobois's Mah Jong cushions. Designed in the 1970s by Hans Hopfer, the luxurious, 3-foot-square hand-sewn seats are even groovier today in vibrant fabrics by Missoni Home and Jean Paul Gaultier. (While the covers are not removable, they can be steam-cleaned.)

This fabric reminds me of the innocence of childhood summers and blowing dandelions in the wind. It's a perfect alternative to the white summer slipcover or used in doses on pillows, as a tableskirt or on a pair of lampshades."

Authors Sam Lubell and Douglas Woods have assembled hundreds of stunning photos of Los Angeles and its environs, many never seen before, by thedocumentarian of California modernism—it's radical, dude. $60, rizzoliusa.com
