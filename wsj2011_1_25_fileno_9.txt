Japanese stocks rose, as exporters were boosted by the euro's recent appreciation against the yen, while metals stocks tumbled in China because of a report that the country may scrap export-tax rebates on more commodities. 

 Japan's Nikkei Stock Average rose 0.7% to 10345.11, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 climbed 0.6% to 4786.04, South Korea's Kospi gained 0.6% to 2082.16, and India's Sensex climbed 0.8% to 19151.28. The Shanghai Composite fell 0.7% to 2695.72 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index slipped 0.3% to 23801.78.

In Tokyo, the euro's rise against the yen Friday boosted exporters, with  Nikon climbing 1.9% and Olympus rising 1.2%.  Honda Motor jumped 3.8% after Nomura Securities upgraded the stock to "buy" from "hold," citing upwardly revised forecasts for profitability and growth at its North American business.

  Fuji Heavy Industries added 1.3% after a weekend report in the Nikkei newspaper that the firm is on track to achieve its profit target.  Kirin Holdings advanced 1.1% after the Nikkei reported the company will form a production and sales joint venture with Chinese brewer China Resources (Holdings) as early as this year.

In China, metal companies led the declines following an Economic Information Daily report that cited unnamed sources as saying the government is considering lowering or scrapping the export-tax rebates on more commodities and energy-intensive products such as rubber and nonferrous metals. In June, China scrapped the export-tax rebate for a variety of commodities, including some types of steel, nonferrous metals, rubber and rubber products. The possible new change to rebates would severely hurt metal companies' revenue, analysts said.

In Shanghai,  Yunnan Chihong Zinc & Germanium plunged 8.3%, Tongling Nonferrous Metals Group dropped 5.7%, Jiangxi Copper gave up 2.7% and  Aluminum Corp. of China lost 1.7%. In Shenzhen, Yunnan Copper fell 2.4% and  Chenzhou Mining Group slid 3.8%.

Analysts also said strong cash demand in China ahead of the weeklong Lunar New Year holiday early next month kept investors from buying stocks.

Southeast Asian stocks came under more selling pressure, continuing to pull back after heavy gains last year as foreign investors sold. Thailand's SET index dropped 4.3% to 963.68, its third straight fall. Jakarta's JSX Composite fell 1% to 3346.06, its fourth consecutive decline, leaving the market down nearly 10% for the year. Manila's main index declined for a fifth straight day, losing 1.2% to 3902.71.

In Hong Kong, shares fell for a third consecutive session, led by China-related firms on concerns about further tightening measures from Beijing after the release of stronger-than-expected economic data last week. Banks were weak. China Construction Bank fell 1.6% and Bank of China dropped 1.4%.

In Sydney, bargain buying in mining stocks after recent declines helped the market overcome a 2.6% fall in  Woolworths after an earnings downgrade from the grocery and general-merchandise retailer. The company lowered its guidance for full-year earnings growth to a range of 5% to 8% from its previous forecast of 8% to 11% growth.  Rio Tinto rose 0.9% and BHP Billiton climbed 0.5%.
