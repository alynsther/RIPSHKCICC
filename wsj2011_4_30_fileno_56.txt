Jurors are scheduled to resume deliberating Monday morning in the insider-trading trial of Galleon Group founder  Raj Rajaratnam.

The jurors on Friday ended their first week of deliberations in lower Manhattan federal court. Deliberations began Monday afternoon, and the jurors hadn't sent any notes with questions or requests regarding the case since Wednesday. The trial of the hedge-fund mogul began in early March.

Mr. Rajaratnam, 53 years old, is charged with 14 counts of securities fraud and conspiracy. Prosecutors say he obtained confidential stock tips from insiders at public companies and others, and traded on them to earn illicit profits and avoid losses totaling $63.8 million.

Mr. Rajaratnam and his lawyers argue that he did nothing wrong and traded based on legitimate research and information that was already public.
