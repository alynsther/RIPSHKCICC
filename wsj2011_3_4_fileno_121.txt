Welcome to the world of contemporary African masks, on exhibit from Tuesday to Aug. 21 at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. The 19 masks, by five artists, show "how the African mask is relevant for contemporary artists on a global level," says curator Yaelle Bird. The one above, by Benin artist Calixte Dakpogan, is titled "Papa Sodabi: The Drunk," sodabi being a popular alcoholic drink in Benin.
