In March or April, how college basketball teams fare against the spread when they are 16+ point underdogs and are bet against by at least 60% of the public.

The average sports fan will likely spend the next few weeks laboring over tournament brackets, trying to decipher which no-name school will crash the March Madness party this year. 

Daniel Fabrizio, the president of the gambling website Sportsinsights.com, recommends a different approach: Find the Cinderellas with the least amount of hype—and put a wad of cash on them. 

Fabrizio examined the final betting lines of every Division I college basketball game played in March or April since 2004 and monitored the bets taken by six popular online bookmakers. He determined when one team is favored by at least 16 points and receives more than 60% of the bets, the underdog covers the spread 56.5% of the time. The results are strikingly similar to those of another study Fabrizio performed in December, which examined the benefits of the contrarian investing technique to betting on NFL games. The study found that when favored teams garner at least 80% of the bets, the other side covers 56% of the time.

The data reflect the phenomenon of oddsmakers shifting the betting lines to encourage action for both sides, particularly when the public bets too heavily on the favorite, a common tendency. 

Though Fabrizio's research suggests that these longshots are better than the public thinks at keeping games close, the approach won't help much in your office bracket pool. Those contests reward picking straight-up winners. Some teams in this study lost by 15 and still covered the spread.
