For 20 visual artists and two dance companies, the commute to work this spring and summer will be more scenic than usual. They are the third such group to be awarded artist studios for a five-month term on Governors Island, where they will work on developing independent projects in a historic military warehouse, Building 110, transformed and run by the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council. 

Not surprisingly, leaving an island metropolis of more than eight million to work on a semi-deserted one with about 80 has a transformative impact. In exit interviews, about 40 of last year's art residents overwhelmingly cited the open layout of the studio's space, which practically forces a sense of community with the other artists, as a major influence on the work they created. 

With waterfront views, a tranquility that is almost impossible to achieve in the city, and 87 green acres to explore, it's perhaps understandable that many of the artists don't ever want to leave the ice-cream-cone-shaped island. Alas, they cannot spend the night. "We're really explicit about that not happening," said Melissa Levin, LMCC's director of artist residencies, noting that the last ferry leaves at 6 p.m., and a nightly security sweep ensures that the artists will be on it. Added Ms. Levin, "Artists will say, 'Well, what if I'm head down on something and I forget?' And we're like, 'You just can't.'"

Governors Island is open to the public on weekends beginning May 27. At Building 110, guests can take docent-led tours of the studios to see work in progress, and check out a group show in the building's gallery, curated by Omar Lopez-Chahoud, aptly titled "No One Is an Island."
