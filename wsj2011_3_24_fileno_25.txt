European stock markets rose Thursday, with retail shares lending support on the back of good corporate news.

That helped to offset some of the uncertainties surrounding the situation in the Middle East and North Africa, and worries over Portugal's economic outlook after its government rejected austerity measures late Wednesday. 

The Stoxx Europe 600 index climbed 1% to 275.96. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 index gained 1.5% to 5880.87, Germany's DAX index advanced 1.9% to 6933.58, and France's CAC-40 index rose 1.4% to 3968.84. 

At the European close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.7% at 12169.08 and the S&P 500 was 0.8% higher at 1307.67. 

Upbeat corporate news in the retail sector helped investors to shrug off softer-than-expected U.K. retail-sales figures for February, which showed a bigger-than-forecast drop in sales volumes. 

ING said the data underlined the fragility of the recovery, but that didn't stop retail stocks from pushing higher, boosted by well-received earnings from two U.K. heavyweights. 

Shares in Kingfisher rose 7.2% after it reported an increase in full-year pretax profit. Next PLC added 4% after reporting full-year earnings in line with expectations, boosted by its directory business, although it cautioned that the consumer environment is tough and sales are being hit by rising prices. 

The news from these retailers, which came just a day after strong results from Spanish clothing retailer Inditex, helped European peers post gains, with the Stoxx Europe 600 retail index up 1.5% at 256.23.

Figures released Thursday showed the euro zone's economic recovery slowed in March but remained in expansionary territory, according to a survey of purchasing managers at manufacturers and service providers. Markit Economics on Thursday said its composite purchasing managers index for the currency area fell to 57.5 from 58.2 in February. A reading above 50.0 indicates private-sector activity expanded. 

The PMI for the manufacturing sector fell to 57.7 from 59.0, while the PMI for services rose to 56.9 from 56.8.

Despite the overall positive tone, traders noted that sovereign-debt worries remain, especially following the resignation of Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Socrates. 

"The fall of the [Portuguese] Government makes it almost certain that Portugal will have to accept external assistance from Europe and the International Monetary Fund as Ireland and Greece have done," said Dolmen Securities. "On top of this negative for Europe, the European leaders meeting today and tomorrow will not discuss the Irish interest rate change and it is unlikely an agreement will be reached on increasing the size of the current stabilization fund." 

Markets shrugged off Fitch's decision to downgrade Portugal's sovereign debt to single-A-minus as a consequence of its failure to pass the fiscal plan. 

Iberian banks were initially weaker after a downgrade of the Spanish sector by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and the collapse of Portugal's minority government. Still, in Madrid, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria closed up 1.2%, while in Lisbon, Banco Espirito Santo rose 0.3%.

In foreign exchange markets, the euro gained ground against the dollar following decent euro-zone PMI data, having fallen in early trade on euro-zone sovereign-debt worries. 

Late in Europe, the euro was at $1.4189, from $1.4086 in late New York trade Wednesday, while the dollar was barely changed at Â¥80.85. 

Elsewhere, spot gold was at $1,446.20 per troy ounce at the European close, up $8.20 from its New York settlement Wednesday, while the May Nymex crude-oil futures contract was up 26 cents at $106.01 per barrel.
