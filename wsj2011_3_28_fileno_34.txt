 on Friday said it closed the sale of its Indian mortgage lending unit Deutsche Postbank Home Finance Ltd to Dewan Housing Finance Ltd for 10.79 billion rupees. 

MAIN FACTS: 

-The deal was announced in December. 

-The sale of the Indian subsidiary is in line with the strategic focus that it defined in 2009 in its Postbank4Future program. 

Among other things, this lays down that Postbank will focus largely on the German market in the future in its core retail banking business. 

-With Dewan Housing Finance Ltd, Postbank has found a purchaser who will further build on Deustche Postbank Home Finance's business model and previous growth history, and who ideally complements the subsidiary's sales and customer structure.
