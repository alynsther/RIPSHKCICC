LONDON—The U.K. Treasury has faced an average of one cyber attack a day from hostile intelligence agencies, Treasury chief George Osborne said on Monday, adding his voice to a number of senior British politicians who have complained of cyber attacks against government systems. 

In a speech Mr. Osborne said that last year hostile intelligence agencies made hundreds of "serious and pre-planned attempts" to break into the Treasury's computer system, making the Treasury one of the most targeted departments across government. 

That included a legitimate email on the subject of meetings with the Group of 20 leading nations that was hijacked and resent a second time, this time with its attachment swapped for one containing a malicious code. 

Last year the U.K. announced it would invest £650m ($1.06 billion) in a new National Cyber Security Program to beef up its online security. 

Mr. Osborne said that in any given month there are over 20,000 malicious emails sent to government networks. In February Foreign Secretary William Hague described a series of attempts by foreign intelligence agency to gain secrets from British systems. According to one person familiar with the matter many of the attacks are orchestrated by Chinese intelligence.
