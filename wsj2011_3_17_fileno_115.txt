An MRI revealed a strain in reliever Joba Chamberlain's left oblique, the kind that should keep him off the mound until at least next week. But the pitcher isn't buying it. 

"I was never worried," said Chamberlain, who believes he could pitch right now if needed. "I know my body better than anything. A test can show whatever it is, but I know what I can do and can't do." 

"I sleep good. I roll over fine. I can cough. I can sneeze. I can stretch," Chamberlain laughed, teetering back and forth to show his range of motion. 

Team doctors, however, are more cautious, and with the MRI showing a definite strain, Chamberlain is not likely to get back into a spring training game until next week at the earliest. Manager Joe Girardi said that Chamberlain will play catch Thursday, and the team will determine a schedule depending on how that goes. 

"I think anytime you hear a strain, you'd say that's bad news. That's not what you want to hear. But right now, he feels good, he's asymptomatic," Girardi said. 

Right now, Girardi is cautiously optimistic that the injury won't prevent Chamberlain from starting the season with the Yankees. If this were the regular season, however, he would almost certainly be on the disabled list right now. 

"A lot of times, if a pitcher has something like this in the season, it's an automatic DL, because you can't short your bullpen for four, five days," Girardi said. "You just can't do that. Here, we have the luxury that you don't have to worry about that."

Chamberlain injured the oblique Friday while pitching against Atlanta, but finished his inning and didn't think much of it. 

"It was something that I didn't really think was that big a deal," Chamberlain said. 

He played catch Sunday, and the Yankees initially considered the injury enough of a non-issue that Chamberlain was scheduled for a full bullpen session midweek. That was pushed back as it began to seem more serious, and the MRI was ordered.
