Although his Islanders have missed the playoffs five of the last six seasons, owner Charles Wang believes his is a team on the rise. Yes, the Isles finished last in the Atlantic Division in 2010-11—a season that included an early stretch in which they lost 20 of 21 games—but Wang chose to look on the bright side of things Wednesday after a news conference to announce the franchise's latest plans to build a new arena. "If it weren't for that 20-game losing streak," Wang said, "we would have done pretty well last year."

Mets first baseman Ike Davis flew back to New York Wednesday to be examined by team doctors after straining his left calf muscle in Tuesday's game against the Colorado Rockies. Davis was injured in the fourth inning Tuesday when he collided with third baseman David Wright as the two converged on an infield fly in front of the mound. He wore a protective boot after the game. "He was hurting bad," manager Terry Collins said. "We'll have to wait and see what the doctors look at."

Landry Fields, the Knicks' shooting guard who ascended from second-round pick to full-time starter, was named to the NBA's All-Rookie team on Wednesday. 

Fields, who played four years at Stanford, averaged 9.7 points and 6.4 rebounds. He received 26 of 29 first-place votes and joined Blake Griffin of the L.A. Clippers, Gary Nea, of the San Antonio Spurs, DeMarcus Cousins of the Sacramento Kings, and John Wall of the Washington Wizards on the first team. Derrick Favors, who was drafted third overall by the Nets before being traded for Utah in the Deron Williams trade, was a second team All-Rookie selection.
