Usually, when shopping on eBay, one doesn't wear cocktail attire or have unlimited access to the city's best food carts. But on Tuesday, to celebrate a collaboration with Derek Lam, the online mega company hosted a block party outside of the designer's SoHo boutique.

"These waffles are amazing," said Mr. Lam of the Belgian treats. There were also dumplings, tacos, burgers and organic ice cream cones. "This is exactly my kind of summer street party." As for his activity on the site, "I just treated myself to a bowling shirt," he said.

Actress Rachel Bilson, who flew in from Chanel Cannes resort show just hours before, buys a lot of vintage. "But I've never sold anything, because I'm just not that technologically coordinated."

"It gets dangerous for me and my vintage shoe addiction," added actress Rose Byrne. "I've certainly made some dirty weekend purchases but they felt very good."
