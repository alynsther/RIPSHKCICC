Stocks climbed higher Thursday, reversing sharp morning losses, as commodities rebounded and defensive stocks strengthened.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 65.89 points, or 0.5%, to 12695.92, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 6.57 points, or 0.5%, to 1348.65, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 17.98 points, or 0.6%, to 2863.04.

The market's recovery was led by defensive stocks in the consumer-staples and health-care sectors, which helped erase a morning slide that had the Dow off by as much as 93 points.

Commodities also found a footing after a morning of declines. Gold futures reversed course to edge higher, while silver pared a sharp drop to finish down 71.60 cents, or 2%, at $34.7930 an ounce. Even so, its May losses totaled 28%.

An upturn in the energy sector helped lift the broader market. Crude-oil futures fell as low as $95.25 a barrel before turning around to push back above $100 a barrel. Oil finished up 76 cents, or 0.8%, at $98.97, off sharply from a close of nearly $104 a barrel on Tuesday, and down 13% for May.

"It was quickly down on the open, and then stocks actually rallied pretty quickly," said  Kelli Hill, portfolio manager at Sentinel Investments. Ms. Hill said the market gyrations were driven by "confusion" about the proper price of commodities on a day when Exxon Mobil CEO  Rex Tillerson told the Senate Finance Committee that oil should rightly be priced at $60 to $70 a barrel.

"What we saw today was people settling into what the real price is [for commodities] and what the real demand is," Ms. Hill said.

  Larry Smith, chief investment officer at Third Wave Global Investors, said Thursday's intraday turnaround reflected an oversold market as well as the general resilience of the equity market this year.

"Fears had gotten to elevated levels in recent days, and you had seen a lot of selling pressure," Mr. Smith said. "U.S. equities have held up remarkably well, given how much other assets have moved the other way, with commodities in general having clearly come off."

Also struggling was Cisco Systems, which skidded 85 cents, or 4.8%, to 16.93 to lead Dow decliners. The network-equipment company reported late Wednesday fiscal third-quarter earnings that exceeded expectations, but warned about a fourth-quarter shortfall and said it would cut its work force.

 gained 2.07, or 3.9%, to 55.68 after first-quarter profits rose 6%, following on Macy's strong report earlier in the week.

Investors started the day with a cautious posture, after China moved again to head off inflation by requiring banks to hold more of their deposits in reserve, the eighth such move since November.

European and Asian markets finished broadly lower. The U.S. dollar slipped against the yen, while the euro gained against the greenback. A weakly bid auction of 30-year bonds led to a selloff in bonds that pushed the yield on the benchmark 10-year note up to 3.228%.

U.S. economic data points were a mild disappointment. Weekly initial claims for jobless benefits fell 44,000 to 434,000, while retail sales rose 0.5%, just below consensus estimates of a 0.6% rise. Producer-price inflation was also a little higher than expected, rising 0.8%.
