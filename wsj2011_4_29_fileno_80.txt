A Swedish coming-of-age drama about sex, power and a psychological tug-of-war between two adolescent friends and rivals won the prize for best narrative feature at the 10th annual Tribeca Film Festival. "She Monkeys," the debut feature by Lisa Aschan, took the top award in the international category, as honors were announced at a Thursday-evening ceremony at the W Union Square.

The narrative feature jury, which included directors David Gordon Green and Souleymane Cisse and actors Dianne Wiest and Scott Glenn, praised the film as "haunting, resonant, but never posed."

"Bombay Beach," by Israeli director Alma Har'el, won the award for best documentary feature. The film, which mixes nonfiction storytelling with choreographed musical interludes, explores the lives of several individuals living near the desolate Salton Sea in the Southern California desert. Jurors, who included Whoopi Goldberg and actor Michael Cera, were unanimous in applauding the film's "beauty, lyricism, empathy and invention."

Top awards also went to Park Jungbum, the director of the South Korean "Journals of Musan," for best new narrative director, and Pablo Croce, director of "Like Water," for best new documentary director. Each award comes with a $25,000 cash prize and an original work of art, with an additional $50,000 of in-kind post-production services in the best new director categories.
