Asian markets ended mostly higher Thursday as solid gains in commodity prices and an advance on Wall Street overnight superseded geopolitical worries in the Mideast and North Africa as well as concerns over sovereign debt in the euro zone.

Japanese stocks ended with modest losses after a choppy session as uncertainty about the stability of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear-power complex and worries about the economic impact from the March 11 earthquake and tsunami spurred a decline in several manufacturers.

The Nikkei Stock Average fell 0.2% to 9435.01 in Tokyo, failing to hold gains registered earlier in the day; China's Shanghai Composite slipped 0.1% to 2946.71.

Powered by resource-sector stocks, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose 1% to 4699.58, South Korea's Kospi added 1.2% to 2036.78, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index gained 0.4% to 22915.28, Taiwan's Taiex climbed 0.4% to 8576.40 and India's Sensex rose 0.8% to 18350.74.

"The strong rise in metal prices has given the materials sector a boost despite disappointing U.S. housing data," said Macquarie Private Wealth investment adviser Marcus Droga.

Several resource-sector shares jumped in the region after gold prices hit a record high and copper prices soared overnight in New York, with energy shares also inspired as Nymex crude-oil prices stayed above $105-a-barrel.

BHP Billiton added 1.2%, Rio Tinto rose 1.1% and Woodside Petroleum added 1.3% in Sydney. Cnooc rose 1.8% and Zijin Mining Group climbed 1.5% in Hong Kong. Shandong Gold-Mining added 0.8% in Shanghai and Sumitomo Metal Mining gained 4.7% in Tokyo, while Sterlite Industries India advanced 1.6% in Mumbai trading.

More recently, May crude-oil prices were down 12 cents at $105.63 a barrel on Globex, while spot gold fell $2.30 to $1,436.30 a troy ounce.

Shares of China Life Insurance dropped 1.9% in Hong Kong, extending Wednesday's losses, after Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley both downgraded the stock in the wake of the company's 2010 results, announced Tuesday.

Shares of China Hongqiao Group, a Chinese aluminum-product manufacturer, rose on its debut to end at 7.90 Hong Kong dollars ($1.01), compared with its initial public offer price at HK$7.20.

Japanese shares struggled for traction amid worries that the earthquake-damage costs will exceed the ¥25 trillion ($308.6 billion) that the government had estimated.

Tatsunori Kawai, chief strategist at Kabu.com Securities, said the government estimate only covered the direct cost from the earthquake and tsunami disaster and not the subsequent problems at the nuclear reactor.

Economists at Capital Economics estimated that the Japanese economy will likely contract in both the first and second quarters of 2011, but remain flat over the full year. They added that spending on reconstruction will boost the nation's gross domestic product.

Several manufacturers lost ground, with Nissan Motor slumping 4.6% after Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn was quoted as saying in a Bloomberg News interview that about 40 parts suppliers in Japan were hampered by the devastating earthquake on March 11. Mr. Ghosn reportedly added that auto makers, including Nissan, will have a "tough" time during the quarter beginning April 1, though impact from plant closures will be minimal in the year ending March 31.

Among other major decliners, Toyota Motor fell 2.7%, Honda Motor lost 2.6% and Canon shed 3.4%.

Tokyo Electric Power, the operator of the stricken nuclear plant, slumped 14% on news it has withdrawn its earlier plan to pay a year-end dividend of ¥30 a share as it gauges the impact of the earthquake and the subsequent effects on its earnings.

South Korean stocks advanced as continued foreign investor purchases bolstered automobile companies. Hyundai Motor rose 4.2% and Kia Motors climbed 3.4% on positive earnings outlooks, and as Japanese auto makers encounter production disruptions.

Among other markets, New Zealand's NZX 50 gained 0.3% and Philippine shares fell 0.4%. Singapore's Straits Times index rose 0.7%, Indonesian shares by 1.6% and Thailand's SET by 0.7%.

In foreign-exchange markets, the euro pared losses, after falling sharply against the U.S. dollar in the wake of the Portuguese Parliament's rejection of an austerity plan and subsequent resignation of the country's prime minister. Europe's shared currency was also pressured by a Moody's downgrade of senior debt and deposit ratings on 30 Spanish banks, and on comments from a top Swedish regulatory official that the European Union's planned round of stress tests on the financial system will expose the failings of a number of banks.

"There will be a number of banks failing the stress test," said Lars Frisell, the chief economist at the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority in an interview in Sydney with Dow Jones Newswires. "If there are any medium-sized banks failing, governments and central banks will have to be ready to take measures," he said.

The euro, which fell as low as $1.4052, was more recently at $1.4092 from $1.4086 in late New York trade Wednesday, and at ¥114.01 from ¥113.96. The dollar was at ¥80.87, from ¥80.91.
