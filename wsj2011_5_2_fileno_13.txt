DETROITâ€”The former chief risk manager for Detroit's school district pleaded guilty Monday to extortion and conspiracy charges for receiving kickbacks from a hand-picked vendor running an employee wellness program.

Stephen A. Hill, the former executive director of the risk management department of the Detroit Public Schools, selected the vendor in 2005 without competitive bidding and without a written contract, according to federal prosecutors. The vendor, Associates for Learning, proposed a six-month pilot program for a total of $150,000.

Within a year, court documents show, the vendor's invoices to the district ballooned to more than $3.32 million. Mr. Hill approved the invoices and, in return, received a 5% cash kickback, according to prosecutors. A Detroit phone number listed for Associates for Learning was disconnected when reached Monday.

Under the terms of the plea agreement, Mr. Hill, 59 years old, faces up to nine years in prison. He could be ordered to pay $3.32 million in restitution, funds needed by a district struggling to close a $327 million deficit. Brian Legghio, Mr. Hill's attorney, said that if Mr. Hill cooperates with federal prosecutors in their remaining case, as he intends to do, the U.S. attorney's office would recommend a prison sentence of 54 months.

Mr. Hill's guilty plea marks the seventh conviction in the case, one of several episodes of corruption that have been investigated during the tenure of the district's emergency financial manager, Robert Bobb, who took charge more than two years ago. Nine people were charged as part of the vendor kickback investigations. The final defendant is set for a jury trial in June.
