Who said golf on the radio wouldn't work? The PGA Tour and Sirius XM satellite radio have agreed to continue live play-by-play broadcasts of every Tour event in 2011, including the majors. Neither party would reveal specifics of the deal, including how long the contract runs. Tour Senior Vice President Paul Johnson said the day-to-day production now will be handled by the Tour rather than Sirius XM. The schedule and lead announcers such as John Maginnes will remain the same.

This year's LPGA schedule will have a worthy new event, even if it comes at a time when many LPGA pros struggle to make a living. The RR Donnelley Founders Cup will have a "mock purse." Players will earn money-list and Solheim Cup points, but all the prize money ($1.3 million) will go to an LPGA-USGA girls charity program. Commissioner Michael Whan describes the effort as a way to "pay it forward."
