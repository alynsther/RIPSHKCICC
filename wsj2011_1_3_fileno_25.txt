PARIS—Registrations of new cars in France declined by 0.7% in December compared to the same month of 2009, making a contraction for the market of 2.2% for the full year, according to industry data released Monday. 

December's registrations were propped up by a last-minute rush as people took advantage of the government's scrapping bonus scheme that came to an end on Dec. 31. 

The French car manufacturers' association said that, adjusted for one more working day in December 2010 than in the same month a year ago, the market decreased by 5% last month. 

For the full year, the French private car market totalled 2.251,736 vehicles— a level roughly in line with the average of the last ten years—down from 2.3 million in 2009. Industry analysts consider annual sales of more than two million cars in the mature French market in a given year to be satisfactory. 

Registrations of cars made by Renault SA, including those of its Romanian low-cost subsidiary Dacia, were down 5.3% in December, but up 4.2% on the year. The Renault brand declined by 7.3% in December, while registrations at Dacia rose 7.1%. 

For the full year, registrations for the Renault brand were down 3.7% compared to 2009, while Dacia's surged by 71%, boosted to a large degree by the scrapping incentive scheme. The incentive was reduced to €500 ($668.5) per vehicle in the second half of the year compared to €700 in the first six months for the purchase of a new car. 

Dacia's no-frills Logan models have attracted a large number of buyers who traditionally would have bought second-hand cars. In contrast, car registrations of cross-town rival PSA  Peugeot-Citroën

 increased by 5.7% year-to-year in December, and were down 1.3% over the full year. Peugeot-Citroën's French market share grew to 30.4% from 28.6% in 2009. Renault, on the other hand, saw its market share shrink to 25.4% in 2010 from 26.6% in 2009.

French registrations of light utility vehicles, which weren't affected by the scrapping bonus, rose 6.7% in December and were up 2% for the full year. December's data also show a 51% year-to-year surge in heavy goods vehicles, making a decline of 3.7% annually. 

French automobile industry executives expect the first quarter of 2011 to be robust in terms of deliveries, following the flurry of last-minute orders booked in December. But they think demand will fizzle later in the year as the artificial support wears off. To be eligible for the scrapping bonus, cars ordered in 2010 must be delivered by the end of March. 

Renault's head of French sales,  Bernard Cambier, commented in a radio interview earlier Monday that order intake in December had been "absolutely phenomenal". He estimated that 370,000 new orders had been recorded in France last month, an increase of 30% from a year before, and said Renault's order book had swelled by 46%. 

Mr. Cambier said the French market in 2011 is likely to fall by between 10% and 13% compared to 2010. He noted, however, that even after a 10% fall next year the market would still be at a level of sales close to the annual average of the last ten years, and described the anticipated decline as "quite relative."
