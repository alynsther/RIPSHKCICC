NEW DELHI -- The Indian government is trying to prevent further increases in prices of diesel, cooking gas and kerosene, Oil Minister  Murli Deora said Wednesday.

"If [crude] oil prices increase then something has to be done, but we are doing our best to see that essential commodity prices don't increase," Mr. Deora told reporters.

Any increase in prices of diesel, the main transportation fuel, leads to a rise in prices of essential commodities such as food items because of higher freight costs. A rise in prices of cooking gas, used mostly in towns and cities, and kerosene, used mostly by poor people for cooking and heating purposes, also hurts consumers.

Mr. Deora added that since commodity prices are high he feels "it is not good to have an Empowered Group of Ministers meeting just now."

The ministers' panel was scheduled to meet in December to review diesel prices as rising global crude prices are hurting state-run fuel retailers. The meeting was cancelled without citing any specific reason.

The government has been struggling to contain rising food prices that have hit millions of people over the past year. India's food inflation rate accelerated to 14.44% year-on-year in the week to Dec. 18 from 12.13% in the prior week.
