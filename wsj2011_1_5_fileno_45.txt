Former Iranian Prince Ali Reza Pahlavi, the youngest son of the late Shah committed suicide on Tuesday morning at his home in Boston, according to a family statement.

Mr.Pahlavi, 44, who lived between Paris and Boston, fought a long battle with depression according to the statement by his brother Reza Pahlavi who announced the death on his personal website. The statement said friends and family were plunged in sorrow.

"Like millions of young Iranians, he too was deeply disturbed by all the ills fallen upon his beloved homeland, as well as carrying the burden of losing a father and a sister in his young life."

Mr.Pahlavi was reclusive, stayed away from politics and was not as well known as his older brother. He is the second child of the late Shah to die of suicide. In 2001, Leila Pahlavi was found dead in a hotel room in London overdosed on sleep medication.

The Shah of Iran, Mohamd Reza Pahlavi, was overthrown from throne in 1979 and his family lives in exile in the United States.
