On Thursday, the same day that Knicks forward Amar'e Stoudemire was named a member of the All-NBA second team, his teammate Carmelo Anthony joined a more unique and dubious fraternity: elite scorers who have been snubbed in the All-NBA voting. 

Anthony, who has received All-NBA recognition four times, averaged 25.6 points per game this season, third-highest in the league. He becomes the third player in the last 25 years to finish in the top three in scoring and not receive All-NBA recognition. The other two were Jerry Stackhouse in 2001 and Allen Iverson in 2008.

This marks the fifth time that Stoudemire, who averaged 25.3 points and 8.2 rebounds, has been so honored. The award is decided in voting by 119 media members.

If Nassau County voters do give the Islanders the go-ahead to build a new hockey arena, it will mean Rick DiPietro, the team's goaltender, will no longer have to apologize to opposing players for the spartan conditions at and around Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum. "You come in from the airport, and you see the arena, and that's pretty much all you get to see of Long Island, which is unfortunate because this is one of the most desirable places to live in the country.''

Mets pitcher Chris Young will undergo season-ending surgery to repair a torn anterior capsule in his right shoulder, the team announced Thursday. After receiving the diagnosis Monday, Young had been mulling whether to opt for surgery or attempt to rehab the injury. 

His Mets career lasted all of four starts. Young was their best starting pitcher when healthy. He went 1-0 with a 1.88 ERA.
