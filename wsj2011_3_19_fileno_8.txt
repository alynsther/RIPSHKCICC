Rookie Michal Neuvirth stopped 33 shots for his fourth shutout and the Washington Capitals put another dagger in the Devils' playoff hopes Friday night in Newark. The loss was the second in as many nights for the home team and left it six points behind idle Buffalo in the race for the final playoff berth in the East with 11 games to play. It marked the first time since early January that they've lost consecutive games.
