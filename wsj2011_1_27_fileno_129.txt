Not so long ago, golf's world rankings may as well have been etched in stone: There was Tiger Woods and then there was everybody else. But these days, the top of the men's game is a lot more crowded.

Lee Westwood ended Mr. Woods' record five-year reign as world No. 1 last year and Martin Kaymer last week also moved within touching distance of the top spot after winning the HSBC Abu Dhabi Championship, a result that saw him climb above Mr. Woods to No. 2 in the rankings. In doing so, Mr. Kaymer ensured that two European players occupied the top two spots in the world rankings fort he first time in 18 years.

But Mr. Woods has an opportunity to respond Thursday when he tees off in his first PGA Tour event of the year at the Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines, Ca.

As a seven-times winner on the track—and holder of the 72-hole record on this course—Mr. Woods is just 11/4 to record another triumph at Torrey Pines. He has the power to master the 7,569-yard South course (one round will also be played on the shorter North course) and even at such a short price, backing Mr. Woods is strongly recommended.

Among the challengers, Hunter Mahan stands out. His accuracy off the tee will stand him in good stead if the wind gets up, while his excellent approach play to the greens—he's 11th on the PGA Tour for hitting greens in regulation—will also be an advantage. Back him each-way at a best-priced 45/1 with Boylesports or Totesport.
