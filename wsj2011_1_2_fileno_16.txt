BAGHDADâ€” Officials says insurgents have assassinated four members of Iraq's security forces in separate attacks in the nation's capital.

Iraqi police and hospital officals say gunmen killed an off-duty traffic policeman in a drive-by shooting in eastern Baghdad, while insurgents killed an Iraqi army colonel in his car downtown.

Assailants killed two other policemen in separate incidents later Sunday, raising suspicion the killings were part of a coordinated campaign.

Insurgents in Iraq frequently target the country's security forces.
