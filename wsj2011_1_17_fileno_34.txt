Chinese shares slumped 3% Monday, dragging other Asian markets lower, as Beijing's move Friday to increase banks' reserve requirements triggered a selloff in real-estate and financial stocks.

"The timing of the latest hike in banks' reserve-requirement ratio is a little earlier than expected, indicating China will remain tough on its monetary-policy stance," said  Xu Wei, an analyst at Sinolink Securities. 

The People's Bank of China said Friday it will raise the share of deposits that banks must keep on reserve by half a percentage point effective Thursday, after six such increases last year and two interest-rate rises since October. The central bank's tightening moves underscore Chinese officials' resolve to combat inflation. And analysts expect further moves.

"The consumer-price index is likely to rebound in January due to strong holiday demand after an expected slower growth in December, so the likelihood of another interest-rate hike is still high," said  Zhang Yanbin, an analyst at Zheshang Securities. 

  Mark Williams, senior China economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note to clients that the firm expects six additional reserve-ratio increases in 2011.

The Shanghai Composite Index slid 84.68 points to 2706.66, its lowest close since Sept. 30. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 0.5% to 24156.97.
