In a sign of the Bay Area's enduring status as the state's innovation hub, 86 of the 121 California firms granted the most patents last year are based in the region, according to data compiled by IFI Claims Patent Services, a division of Fairview Research LLC that analyzes patent data. Among Bay Area companies,  Intel Corp.,  Cisco Systems Inc., Oracle Corp.,  Apple Inc. and  Applied Materials Inc. were granted the most patents in 2010, with Intel in the top spot, generating 1,653 patents last year, compared with 1,537 the previous year. "Many of those companies are involved in electronics, computers and biotech, areas that tend to generate relatively high numbers of patents," says  Darlene Slaughter, general manager of IFI Claims Patent Services.
