LONDON—Stocks rallied across Europe as auto stocks rose and a brief rise in the Dow Jones Industrial Average above the 12000 level encouraged investors.

Anticipation regarding a statement from the Federal Reserve's policy-making Open Market Committee scheduled for release after trading closed added to the rally. Major indexes ended higher, although they gave up some of their gains as the Dow slipped back.

"There is speculation that the Federal Reserve will look to support the U.S. recovery, even though growth has seemingly returned to the world's largest economy," said  Sean Power, an equity analyst at City Index, in comments on the company's website. 

The Stoxx Europe 600 index closed up 0.9% to 282.47, bouncing back from a 0.7% drop in the prior session. 

In Frankfurt, the DAX gained 1% to 7121.35. Autos and parts were among the best performers, led higher by Porsche. The company's shares rose 7.1% after it said its vehicle sales in China rose 63% on the year, marking a new annual sales record. Porsche also said talks with Qatar regarding a planned capital increase were positive.

Shares of industrial conglomerate Siemens advanced 0.7%, a day after the firm reported a forecast-beating 16% gain in first-quarter net profit. 

In Paris, the CAC 40 closed 0.7% higher at 4049.07. Renault rose 3.3%. Barclays Capital upgraded the stock to "overweight" from "underweight," while  Credit Suisse boosted its target price. 

French hotels group Accor rose 4.2%. The firm said it opened 41 new hotels in the Asia-Pacific region last year. 

In London, the FTSE 100 closed up 0.9% at 5969.21. The minutes of the January meeting of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee showed that member  Martin Weale joined perennial inflation hawk  Andrew Sentance in calling for a 0.25 percentage-point increase in interest rates, now at a record low 0.5%. Mr. Sentance had been a lone voice in favor of raising rates since June.

"The surprise was not so much that someone joined Andrew Sentance— that was always a risk," said BNP Paribas. "It was the fact that it was Martin Weale, who most would have assumed was of a more dovish persuasion."
