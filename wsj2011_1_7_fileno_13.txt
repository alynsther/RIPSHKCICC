OTTAWAâ€”Canadian job creation modestly exceeded expectations in December as employers, primarily in the private sector, filled full-time positions and eliminated part-time workers, leaving the jobless rate steady at a near two-year low. The manufacturing sector led with the largest monthly job creation in records dating to 1976.

The economy overall added a net 22,000 jobs, the third consecutive increase and up from November's 15,200, Statistics Canada said Friday. Full-time jobs accounted for 81% of total employment. The jobless rate was unchanged at 7.6%.

The market had expected 20,000 net jobs to be created and the jobless rate to climb to 7.7%.

Employment increased by 2.2%, or 369,000, compared with December 2009, recovering from a 1.1% decline the prior year.

The Canadian dollar was firmer after the data were released. The U.S. dollar dropped to C$0.9957 from C$0.9965 just before the release. The Canadian dollar has traded higher than the U.S. unit in recent sessions.

The data are unlikely to change expectations for the Bank of Canada to stand pat at its first policy decision of the year on Jan. 18. However, it could raise anticipation for the central bank to begin raising rates again sooner than expected, particularly if U.S. recovery quickens.

"This is a solid report, with more strength than meets the eye. In particular, the huge upturn in factory and transportation payrolls provides a tantalizing hint that the upturn in the U.S. economy is spilling over into Canada," BMO Capital Markets' deputy chief economist said in a report. "While the result will not make a big impact on Bank of Canada policy, it does solidify our view that the bank will start to tighten before midyear."

Last month, employers hired 38,000 full-time workers, the fourth gain in five months, and shed 16,100 part-time employees. However, part-time employment grew 3.4% over the past year, faster than the 1.9% rate for full-time employment.

Employment in the manufacturing sector bounced back from November's 29,000 decline with the addition of 65,700 new jobs. These were primarily in Ontario and Quebec and were spread across a number of industries, StatsCan said. Other notable gains were in transportation and warehousing, where 44,500 new jobs were added, and natural resources, up 7,700. Employment in both these sectors has grown by 10.8% over the past 12 months.

The biggest declines last month were in construction, health care and social assistance, and trade.

Overall, 40,800 net new jobs were added in the goods-producing sector, while the services-producing sector lost 18,800 jobs.

The labor force expanded by 19,200 and the participation rate, which is the share of the population in the labor force, held steady at 66.9%.

Average hourly wages grew 2.4% year-on-year, faster than the 2.2% increase the prior month. The rate for permanent workers rose to 2.3% from 2.2%.
