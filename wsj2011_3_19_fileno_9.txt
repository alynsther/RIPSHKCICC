Ryan Callahan, Marian Gaborik and Brian Boyle scored 1:07 apart in the Rangers' highest-scoring first period in more than 11 years, and they then held on for a key victory over the Montreal Canadiens Friday night. The teams, fighting for playoff positioning in the Eastern Conference, staged a postseason-like show at boisterous Madison Square Garden. The Rangers, in seventh place, moved within five points of sixth-place Montreal with 10 games left for both teams.
