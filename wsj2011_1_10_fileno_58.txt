New York-based rock band Guster released its sixth studio album, "Easy Wonderful," in October, and the band will appear on "Conan" Monday night to support it. The 42-minute album took 26 months to make, according to Guster's lead singer, Ryan Miller. 

"Thousands of hours of work so that people can judge it in an infinitesimally smaller amount of time," he said after tabulating the creative process for The Wall Street Journal. "I can't decide if that's exhilarating or depressing." 

To get an idea of the work that goes into making a Guster album, we asked Mr. Miller to count up and break down the hundreds of hours that went into "Easy Wonderful," from writing the songs to finding diversions on MTV.

"Culture is so disposable now," he said. "It's kind of anachronistic to spend so much time on something that's just going to be thrown out there with everything else that's out there, but it means you can't really be results-orientated. You have to enjoy the process."

For creative and social "escape hatches," the band turned to "The Jersey Shore" and Chatroulette, a Web site that matches random strangers for live video chats. "Making a record is an incredibly insular process and the arguments are real, because we all care deeply about the music. You need to be able to talk about Snooki," he said.

"And Chatroulette opened it up. You're a person! Talk to me! It was something we could kind of share." 

He also noted that all three of the band's original members—guitarist Adam Gardner, drummer Brian Rosenworcel and himself—started families while the record was created. 

"Four babies made," he said, still apparently thinking in metrics. "About 45 minutes."
