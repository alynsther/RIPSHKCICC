's newest 747 passenger jet took to the skies for the first time Sunday, marking the third maiden flight of a new Boeing commercial airplane in the past 15 months. 

Painted in its orange and red "sunrise" livery, the massive, four-engine 747-8 Intercontinental lifted off from Paine Field, north of Seattle, at 10 a.m. local time under partly cloudy skies and gusty northerly winds. 

At 250 feet long, the 747-8 is 18 feet longer than its predecessor, the 747-400, and is the largest commercial plane ever built by Boeing. 

After a 4½-hour test flight, the big jet landed at Boeing Field in Seattle at 2:25 p.m. Pacific time. 

At a press conference following the flight, Boeing's two test pilots said the first flight was a success, which enabled them to complete a number of standard checks to begin the official flight-test regime.

The flight-test program will involve about 600 flight hours, which should last through the summer, according to  Elizabeth Lund, the 747 program manager. 

On hand for the event was  Joe Sutter, the original 747 project engineer, who turns 90 years old on Monday. In a tribute, Mr. Sutter's initials were stenciled in blue on the 747-8's front landing-gear door. 

Sunday's first flight of the Intercontinental follows two other high-profile airplane launches. In December 2009, Boeing finally flew the much-delayed 787 Dreamliner, which is nearing the end of its flight-test program, with first delivery to  All Nippon Airways Co.

 slated for sometime this summer. 

In February 2010, the 747-8 Freighter flew for the first time. Now nearly two years behind schedule, the freighter version of the jet encountered significant problems during its flight-test program and Boeing now expects to deliver the first freighter to Cargolux Airlines International SA by this summer. 



The first 747-8 passenger jet is to be configured for a private customer, likely in the Middle East. The first airliner is slated for delivery to German carrier Deutsche Lufthansa AG sometime in early 2012, assuming Boeing runs into no trouble during the flight test certification of the Intercontinental.

The 747 has been a global workhorse since it first entered service in 1970. And though the 747-8 shares the same distinctive look, with a humped upper deck, it is vastly different from previous models. It sports a brand new wing, increased use of composite materials, new cockpit avionics and the same new  General Electric Co.

 engines that are offered on the Dreamliner.

Boeing has 114 orders on the books for the 747-8, with 76 for the cargo version and 38 for the passenger model. 

But sales for the passenger version have been slow, with customers hesitant to commit to the new 467-passenger jet. Rival Airbus, a unit of  European Aeronautic Defence & Space Co., offers a larger-capacity jetliner with its double-deck A380, while Boeing's smaller, twin-engine 777 remains popular with international airlines.

The passenger version of the 747-8 has a list price of about $317 million, but customers typically negotiate deep discounts. Earlier this month,  Air China Ltd.

 agreed to buy five Intercontinentals and airline officials said they received "significant price concessions" from Boeing. 

Boeing has also been forced to compensate its customers for the three-year Dreamliner delay and recent deals for 777s, 737s and 747-8s have been seen as part of that compensation strategy.
