BERLIN—Chancellor Angela Merkel Thursday said she would seek to secure an agreement for Germany to spread its contributions to the euro zone's permanent bailout fund over five years instead of the three- to four-year timeline European Union leaders had been discussing. 

Germany had agreed, at a meeting of finance ministers in Brussels on Monday, to make €22 billion ($31.03 billion) in total contributions to a permanent bailout fund that would take effect in 2013, . 

Mrs. Merkel also said in an address to parliament ahead of a summit of EU leaders in Brussels Thursday and Friday that the Portuguese parliament's rejection of austerity plans proposed by the minority government was "regrettable." 

Prime Minister  José Socrates resigned late Wednesday after failing to persuade the opposition to support the plans at a vote, greatly raising the likelihood that Portugal will seek a bailout from its euro-zone partners. 

Mrs. Merkel also promoted the long-term reforms that EU leaders are expected to outline to prevent debt crises in the future, saying they are working to "close a hole" in the infrastructure of their common-currency zone and that "anyone who exceeds debt limits in the future must expect tough consequences."
