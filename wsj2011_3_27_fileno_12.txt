TOKYOâ€”Highly toxic levels of radioactivity, up to 10 million times the normal level for reactor cooling systems, have been discovered at least two units of the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, government nuclear safety officials said Sunday, the latest setback to efforts to restore the plant's cooling and control systems. 

The very high level of 1,000 millisieverts, is "a rather large figure," said  Hidehiko Nishiyama, spokesman for Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency. 

He said that the level of radioactivity was likely from the core of the reactor but said that they had not yet determined by what means the water was leaking. The water could have come from a breach in the system or from somewhere in the pipes that carry cooling water to and from the reactor. 

Authorities said that they were attempting to pump the radioactive water to the condenser units that allow steam from the reactor to cool down so that workers could continue their efforts to lay power cables and perform checks in order to bring the plant's systems back on line. 

The work to restore the plant's systems, knocked out in the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, has been repeatedly delayed by halts as radioactive clouds and water leakages have forced the stoppage of planned work.
