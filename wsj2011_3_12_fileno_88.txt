The globalization of golf continues apace at the WGC-Cadillac Championship this week at Doral. Not just among the competitors—44 of the 68 are international players—but among the fans. Jhonattan Vegas, whom even antigolf Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez has praised, was swarmed during practice by children from Miami's large Venezuelan community. A full quarter of the gallery following new world No. 1 Martin Kaymer of Germany on Thursday were Germans, some tourists, some who'd flown in for the event.

Ryo Ishikawa, also in Miami, awoke Friday to the news of the earthquake in his native Japan. He had six holes to play in the weather-delayed first round; he birdied two for a 65. "We can provide encouragement and hope for the people of Japan by doing the job," said the 19-year-old superstar, a bigger celebrity in Japan than Tiger Woods ever was in the U.S. He got word before the round that his parents in Tokyo were fine.
