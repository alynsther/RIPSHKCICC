MADRID—Two earthquakes struck southeast Spain in quick succession Wednesday, killing at least 10 people, and causing major damage to buildings and historic sites.

The epicenter of the temblors--with magnitudes of 4.4 and 5.2--was near the town of Lorca in the southeastern region of Murcia, according to preliminary estimates.

Local telephone lines have been affected by the earthquake.

Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero has ordered a military unit in charge of civil emergencies in the area, and Deputy Prime Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba is expected there to assess the damage early Thursday.

Spain rarely has earthquakes, and few buildings are built to resist them.

Large chunks of stone and brick fell from the facade of a church in Lorca as Spanish state TV was broadcasting live from the scene. Nervous groups of residents gathered in public places, talking about what happened and calling relatives and friends on their cell phones.

  John Bellini, a seismologist with the U.S. Geological Survey's National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colorado, said the larger earthquake had a preliminary magnitude of 5.3 and struck 220 miles (350 kilometers) south-southeast of Madrid, the Associated Press reported.

The quake was about 10 kilometers (6 miles) deep, and was preceded by the smaller one with a magnitude 4.5 in the same spot, Mr. Bellini told the AP. He classified the bigger quake as moderate and said it could cause structural damage to older buildings and masonry.

The quakes occurred in a seismically active area near a large fault beneath the Mediterranean Sea where the European and African continents brush past each other, USGS seismologist Julie Dutton told the AP.

The USGS said it has recorded hundreds of small quakes in the area since 1990.
