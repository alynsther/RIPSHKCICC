MUMBAI -- Larsen & Toubro Ltd., India's largest engineering and construction firm by sales, said Monday the company will reorganize itself into nine operating units to enable faster decision-making and increasing competitiveness.

"We are trying to bring about a transformation. A change in mindset, where decision-making is closer to our clients," Director J.P. Nayak told reporters at a press conference.

The units would have separate boards of directors, but they would be legally part of the parent company.
