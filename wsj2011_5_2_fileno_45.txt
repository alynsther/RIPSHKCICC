NEW DELHI -- India's merchandise exports rose 43.8% to $29.1 billion in March from a year earlier, according to provisional data issued Monday by the Ministry of Commerce.

The government didn't give any reasons for the growth in exports.

Imports rose 17.2% to $34.7 billion, largely due to a rise in non-oil imports, which were up 21% from a year earlier at $25.3 billion.

India's March trade deficit narrowed to $5.6 billion from $9.3 billion a year earlier, the data showed. In the last financial year that ended March 31, the trade deficit stood at $104.8 billion marginally down from $109.6 billion in 2009-10.

Oil imports during April to March rose 16.7% to $101.6 billion, while non-oil imports rose 23.7% to $249 billion.
