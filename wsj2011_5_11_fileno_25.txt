The energy sector pulled stocks lower, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index posting its biggest one-day point and percentage drop in two months, as crude-oil prices tumbled.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 130.33 points, or 1%, to 12630.03. The Nasdaq Composite declined 26.83 points, or 0.9%, to 2845.06, and the S&P index lost 15.08 points, or 1.1%, to 1342.08.

 shedding 2.1%. Crude-oil prices fell as data pointed to a bigger-than-expected jump in crude inventories. 

A decline in the euro on renewed worries over the finances of Greece and Portugal helped drive the dollar higher, which only added to the pressure on crude because the commodity is inversely correlated with the U.S. currency. 

"It's a perfect storm for selling right now," said  Ryan Larson, head of U.S. stock trading at RBC Global Asset Management. He cited the crude inventory data, the jump in the dollar and the drop in the euro. 

The market's turn began shortly before noon, as crude-oil prices headed lower. Crude prices fell below $100 shortly after noon and by 12:06 p.m. EDT, CME Group halted trading in crude oil, heating oil and gasoline futures for the first time in over two years when gasoline dropped to its trading limit.

The halt resulted in a five-minute delay in trading for all three energy-futures contracts. 

"Seeing circuit breakers in effect in any kind of market does tend to spook other markets" due to their interconnected relationship, RBC's Mr. Larson said. 

As the drop in crude pressured the energy sector, the DJIA lost nearly 80 points between noon and its low of the day at 12577.21.
