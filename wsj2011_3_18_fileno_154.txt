Bill Cosby broke new ground in American television on "I Spy" (1965-1968), as the first African-American actor to co-star in a dramatic series. He soon after starred as high-school gym teacher Chet Kincaid in the short-lived comedy "The Bill Cosby Show" (1969-71). The series had no laugh track and featured a score by Quincy Jones. The co-creator of the show, Ed. Weinberger, later helped create "Taxi" and Mr. Cosby's 1980s TV hit "The Cosby Show."

This Emmy-winning seven-season series starred Robert Young as Dr. Welby. His foil is a youthful and surprisingly more traditional doctor played by James Brolin. Episodes touched upon a range of situations, including "acid flashes" and pregnant hippies.

 The Complete Series 

The 1979 miniseries was based on novels by K.M. Peyton, set in England at the turn of the 20th century. Christine McKenna plays Christina Parsons, an orphaned teenage heiress sent to a rundown estate owned by her cruel uncle and his two sons, where she proceeds to stir the pot. Michael Ferguson, director of several episodes, is best known as a director of "Dr. Who" and went on to executive produce episodes of popular BBC soap opera "EastEnders."
