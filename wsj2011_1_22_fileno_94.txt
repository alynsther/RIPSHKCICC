Photography was an expensive, primitive medium when fashion magazines like Vogue and Harper's Bazaar were founded in the early 20th century. Readers got glimpses of the latest styles mostly through the elegant drawings of Georges Lepape, Erté and André Édouard Marty. Their sketches were joyous elaborations of silhouette and line—elements common to both designer and draftsman. 'Drawing Fashion: A Century of Fashion Illustration' (Prestel, 240 pages, $49.95), the catalog for an exhibition on view at London's Design Museum, unites the work of these pioneers alongside dozens more from later decades. With the postwar flowering of fashion photography, illustrators felt the need for novelty—like Antonio's imitation of the Pop Art pyrotechnics of the painter Bridget Riley. Closer to our own time, Mats Gustafson and François Berthoud have shown a renewed emphasis on the pure, often faceless, silhouette. This book lends support to Colin McDowell's claim, in an introductory essay, that "drawing fashion will no more die than figurative painting will."
