A famous provocateur, Italian heiress Marchesa Luisa Casati was not only known for her pet cheetahs (which she is said to have walked on diamond-studded leashes) but also for her love of snakes.

Legend has it she wore live serpents curled around her neck like the most exotic kind of jewelry. 

While these vibrantly hued python totes are nowhere near as slithery (or deadly) as Casati's writhing ornaments, they're sure to draw attention, especially when worn against the dark palettes favored in the chilly months. 

So, start defrosting early by carrying a burst of candied orange, hydrangea blue, deep green or acid yellow in rich, scaly texture. 

These carryalls are just the pill for the winter bluesâ€”and will be well worth their price tags once spring has finally sprung.
