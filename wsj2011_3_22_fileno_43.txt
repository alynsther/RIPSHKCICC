Japanese equities surged to lead Asian markets higher Tuesday as easing fears about an earthquake-damaged nuclear power plant and low valuations after last week's sell-off lured investors back into stocks.

Stocks rallied after Wall Street powered ahead for a third session overnight, even as markets remained wary of the Libyan crisis's impact on crude-oil prices.

In Tokyo, the Nikkei Stock Average, which fell more than 10% last week, jumped 4.4% to end at 9,608.32. The buying came as several analysts called Japanese stocks undervalued after their recent tumble, with Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Chairman Warren Buffett suggesting the slump was a buying opportunity.



"Foreign investors were completely thrown off by Japan's nuclear-power-plant problems, but there is still room for them to buy back the undervalued shares," said Masayoshi Yano, a senior market analyst at Meiwa Securities.

Elsewhere, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 0.8% to 22857.90 and China's Shanghai Composite added 0.3% to 2919.14.

Refining and petrochemical shares in and outside Japan posted broad gains on hopes that the loss of capacity caused by the earthquake and tsunami would boost demand from facilities that emerged intact.

BHP Billiton Ltd. shed 0.7% and Rio Tinto Ltd. dropped 0.6%, while Woodside Petroleum Ltd. gave up 1.2%. Some uranium stocks continued to recover from their recent hefty losses, with Extract Resources Ltd. rising 1.3%.

"Obviously we were priced for Armageddon last week, but I think the easy snap-back gains have probably been seen, and now we will see if investors are prepared to buy on strength and bet that the Japanese nuclear crisis is over and oil prices aren't going to derail global markets," said Ben Potter, market strategist at IG Markets.
