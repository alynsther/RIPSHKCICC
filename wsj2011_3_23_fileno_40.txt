FRANKFURT—European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet Wednesday said "much remains to be done" to improve the functioning of the financial sector, calling for more stringent oversight of "shadow" banks and a solution on how to define and treat financial institutions whose failures are seen as threats to the entire financial system. 

"I believe we are now about halfway through the comprehensive reforms that the crisis has called for," Mr. Trichet said in Frankfurt at an event closed to the public, according to the text of his speech. 

Mr. Trichet said it is crucial to continue with badly-needed financial sector reforms. 

"The issue of systemically important financial institutions requires further reflection, and oversight of the proper functioning of financial markets in a way that avoids undue volatility, excessive influence of dominant players and oligopolistic market structures, while reinforcing transparency, needs to be addressed resolutely," Mr. Trichet said. 

More needs to be done to control the activities of the "shadow" banking sector, or large, complex institutions—such as hedge funds—that don't endure the same stringent financial oversight as regular banks. 

"We have to ensure that tighter regulatory rules do not provide incentives for financial institutions to shift their activities to unregulated areas."
