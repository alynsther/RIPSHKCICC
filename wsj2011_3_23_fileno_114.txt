RIM unveiled the PlayBook back in September, but took nearly seven months to launch it commercially, allowing time for rival firms to launch their own tablets and for Apple to release its second-generation tablet, its iPad 2.

The initial version of the PlayBook may disappoint customers already used to some advances in other tablets. It will need to be tethered to a BlackBerry to achieve some functionality, such as reading email attachments. It also doesn't allow for a cellular connection, so users can only go online using Wi-Fi or by tethering the device to their BlackBerrys. RIM has indicated that future PlayBook models will have cellular capability.

The PlayBook launch has confused some mobile-market watchers over its intended market. RIM executives have said the product will benefit from RIM's proven corporate-security infrastructure, appealing to both business executives and everyday users, who want to use tablets for personal tasksâ€”everything from booking cinema tickets to mapping out street directions.

The launch also comes amid a senior marketing-executive transition at RIM. Earlier this month, RIM said its chief marketing officer had decided to leave the company, though he'd be staying on during a transition period straddling the PlayBook launch. The company, based in Waterloo, Ontario, hasn't named a replacement. RIM is scheduled to announce fourth-quarter earnings Thursday.
