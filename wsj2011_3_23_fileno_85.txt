Chase Utley is not the best player in baseball—Albert Pujols has ownership of that crown and doesn't seem in a hurry to surrender it. However, Utley's lingering knee problems have forced the Phillies to look for a fill-in at second base. In doing so, they may be quickly realizing that he's the most irreplaceable player in the game.

Without Utley's services for the start of the season, the Phillies first considered using utility infielder Wilson Valdez to replace Utley. Unsatisfied with that option, they signed Luis Castillo on Monday, who had been released by the Mets just 24 hours earlier. Castillo, a 35-year-old who hit .235 last year and has lost most of the speed that allowed him to thrive earlier in his career, is not exactly the kind of player that championship teams give starting jobs to. Using the metric Wins Above Replacement, the value decline from Utley to Castillo would be the biggest drop of any starter-to-backup in baseball.

If Pujols were to suddenly get injured, the Cardinals would have the option of moving Lance Berkman to first base and then deploying a decent reserve such as Jon Jay to fill the hole in the outfield. While they would take a hit offensively, this would represent an upgrade to the defense, and Jay has shown offensive potential as well. 

Philadelphia's second-base quandary further shows why middle infielders who can also hit well, such as Utley or Colorado's Troy Tulowitzki, are so valuable to begin with. The league is hardly brimming with quality reserves at those positions.
