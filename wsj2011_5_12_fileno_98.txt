For decades, golf writers and commentators have persistently suggested the Players Championship is or could become the game's "fifth major." This is in large part because the Players is the premier tournament run by the PGA Tour, and because of its large purse—this weekend's winner will take home $1.71 million. Still, the Masters, the British Open, the U.S. Open and the PGA Championship are universally regarded as golf's only major events.

The fifth-major mentions date as far back as 1977, in the Washington Post. There was much talk in the 1980s about the idea of the Players becoming the fifth major, which Payne Stewart was vehemently against. "Just because we're playing for a lot of money on a great golf course, I don't see that it should be a major," he said in 1988.

Nevertheless—using Factiva, a database with more than 28,000 news sources—The Count found 4,264 references over the years to the Players as a "fifth major." But the mentions were typically surrounded with all manner of hedge phrasing, such as referring to it as "the so-called fifth major." A quick tally let us determine the most common ways the nickname was introduced: There were 907 references where it was called the "unofficial fifth major" and 546 cases where a writer said the event is "regarded" as the fifth major. 

One writer for the Globe and Mail even wrote that the Players is "well on its way to becoming golf's fifth major." That was in 1983.
