Short-selling at the New York Stock Exchange rose in the first half of January, according to the latest twice-monthly figures for the exchange.

The data were released a day later than expected because of technical problems.

In the period ended Jan. 14, the number of short-selling positions at the NYSE not yet closed out, known as short interest, rose 0.8107%. The positions rose to 12,624,792,572 shares from 12,523,260,782 shares in the period ended Dec. 31. (On Wednesday, the Nasdaq Stock Market released its short statistics, showing a 0.6746% rise.)

Investors who short shares do so by borrowing and selling them, betting that share prices will fall and that they can buy them back at a lower price for return to the lender. Stocks can also be shorted for reasons other than bearish bets, including hedging strategies.

"It is not surprising to see short interest rise when the market is rising-short sellers tend to increase exposure as valuations are getting richer," said  Eric Newman, portfolio manager at TFS Capital in West Chester, Pa.

The NYSE short ratio-or the number of days' average volume represented by outstanding short positions for mid-January was 2.7 days, down from 4.1 days at the end of December.

Though a substantial short position reflects speculation a stock's price will decline, some investors consider an increase in short interest to be potentially positive because the borrowed shares eventually must be bought back.

The next short-interest report is scheduled to appear in The Wall Street Journal on Feb. 10.
