WASHINGTONâ€”Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker is expected to step down as head of a panel that advises President Barack Obama on economic issues, according to a person familiar with the matter. 

Mr. Volcker has been synonymous with a rule that bars banks from making certain types of trades with their own capital. That rule, which is aimed at helping damp risk, is part of sweeping financial regulation passed last year and is known as the "Volcker Rule."

Mr. Volcker headed the President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board, created by Mr. Obama during the financial crisis of 2009 to get independent analysis about how to lift the shaky economy. The board's members include venture capitalists, labor leaders, professors and executives from companies such as  General Electric Co.

The expected departure of Mr. Volcker comes amid a reshuffling that is reaching top levels of the White House. The president is expected to name Gene Sperling, a senior adviser to Treasury Secretary Timothy, as director of his National Economic Council.
