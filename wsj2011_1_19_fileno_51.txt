His hometown NFL team is looking for a defensive coordinator, but  Mike Pettine has no plans to leave the Jets to join the Philadelphia Eagles, he told The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday night.

Mr. Pettine, 44 years old, grew up in Doylestown, Pa., less than 30 miles north of Philadelphia, and was a head coach for seven years at two suburban Philadelphia high schools before joining the Baltimore Ravens in 2002. His ties to the region and the Jets' success over the past two seasons would make him an attractive candidate to replace  Sean McDermott, whom the Eagles fired last week.

"Have heard the rumor too," Mr. Pettine, who is under contract with the Jets for another year, wrote in an email. "No truth to it."

Under head coach  Rex Ryan and Mr. Pettine, who were hired in January 2009, the Jets ranked first in the NFL in team defense last season and third this season. They have reached the AFC Championship Game each of the past two years; a victory Sunday over the Steelers would put them in the Super Bowl for the first time since 1969.
