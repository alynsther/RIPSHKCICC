 QUOTED: "I do believe that the second round of securities purchases was effective. We saw that first in the financial markets. The way monetary policy always works is by easing financial conditions. ... We saw all the changes in financial markets and quite significant changes that one would expect. ... And, indeed, we saw the same types of financial market responses in the first round, which began in March of 2009." 

 -- Federal Reserve  Chairman Ben Bernanke,  April 27, 2011 

 REALITY: "Quantitative Easing 2," the Fed's purchases of $600 billion in Treasury notes and bonds, may have helped the economy, but Mr. Bernanke overstates his case.

Easier monetary policy is supposed to work, for the most part, by driving interest rates lower. Yet interest rates are significantly higher now than they were when the Fed started buying bonds in November.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury was 3.34% on April 26, about three-quarters of a percentage point higher than the 2.63% yield when the program started on Nov. 3.

The "QE2" program was supposed to reduce costs for private borrowing as well, but yields on AAA corporate bonds and 30-year mortgages also have risen by about three-quarters of a percentage point since the Fed began its second buying program.

By contrast, yields on corporate bonds plunged by more than two percentage points during the first round of Fed buying in 2009.
