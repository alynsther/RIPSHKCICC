TOKYOâ€”Japan's prime minister Naoto Kan said Thursday he will reshuffle his cabinet on Friday, a move aimed at placating opposition parties and boosting his flagging support ratings as he tries to smooth the passage of the next fiscal year's budget through parliament. 

The reshuffle is unlikely to affect the post of Finance Minister, with Yoshihiko Noda, who was chiefly responsible for drawing up the budget bill, expected to stay in his job.

Mr. Kan will likely use the personnel makeover as a bargaining chip with the opposition in steering the budget deliberations and to give a quick boost to his support ratings.

"I would like to reshuffle the cabinet tomorrow," Mr. Kan said at a press conference after the annual convention of the ruling Democratic Party of Japan.

His main task will be to decide the fate of Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshito Sengoku, the government's top spokesman. Opposition parties are demanding Mr. Kan fire his right-hand man, and have censured Sengoku in the opposition-controlled upper house.

Mr. Kan refused to comment on the fate of Mr. Sengoku at the press conference, but local media reports say he is likely to be replaced by former DPJ Secretary General Yukio Edano.

Mr. Kan is also expected to add veteran fiscal hawk Kaoru Yosano to his new cabinet, according to media reports. Mr. Yosano, who favors doubling the country's 5% consumption tax rate to finance rising social security costs, on Thursday left the six-member opposition party he helped create in anticipation of joining the Kan cabinet.

Prior to founding the Sunrise Party of Japan, Yosano, 72, held key economy posts in the Liberal Democratic Party, including the finance, banking, economy, and fiscal policy posts. Kan said that Yosano's thinking on fiscal policy is in line with that of the DPJ.
