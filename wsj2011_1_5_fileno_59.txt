New to New York's ubiquitous hamburger scene is the Counter, a California-based franchise that recently set up shop in Times Square.

The Counter, a California-based burger franchise that recently set up shop in Times Square, offers a variety of options: some 312,120 different burger combinations.

The Counter falls into the "fast casual" category, a cheery place to sit but not to linger. A recent meal lasted 35 minutes and cost about $20. 

Counter's niche is its options: five kinds of meat, on six styles of buns or in a bowl, with 63 toppings, from Gruyère to grilled pineapple. Sides include sweet-potato fries and "onion strings," a droopy sibling to onion rings.

But is the sum greater than the parts? It depends. 

Some of the toppings are misses—grilled onions and organic mixed greens, for example—but you can do just fine with cheese, bacon and familiar fixings. 

Or, go crazy and throw in some dried cranberries and horseradish mayo. If you've got the option, why not?
