When one pictures a salty French fisherman bracing himself against sea spray and wind in a burly wool sweater, a modern-day slicker suddenly seems inauthentic, unstylish, wimpy and over-prepared. This spring, consider ditching the windbreaker when it's blustery and drizzling and throw on one of these handsome knits, which deflect moisture and wind the old-fashioned way.

Seafarers from Brittany who sailed to England to sell onions in the 1800s, wore tight-knit sweaters made from unwashed sheep's wool to bear the elements; Irish mariners wore the now-iconic Aran sweater on the water, with its moisture-wicking lanolin-coated cable knit. And the worsted wool Guernsey sweater—named after the Channel Island where it's made—was worn by the British Royal Navy in the 19th century and is still sported by the U.K.'s 7th Armoured Brigade (aka the "Desert Rats") and the Intelligence Corps. 

If a thick-skinned sweater was good enough for English captains in the Battle of Trafalgar (which they were), they're good enough gear for a wet spring day or a stormy summer night. As for the absence of a hood, not to worry: The wet look is in.
