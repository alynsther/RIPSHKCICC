 said Thursday its new casino-resort in Macau's Cotai area will have 450 gambling tables when it opens in May, with room for 150 more. 

The Hong Kong-listed casino operator, controlled by the family of tycoon  Lui Che Woo, said earlier Thursday it expects its HK$14.9 billion (US$1.9 billion) Galaxy Macau to be the only new resort to open in the Chinese gambling territory until "at least the end of 2011" and that it will feature 2,200 hotel rooms and over 50 food and beverage outlets. 

The company will apply to the government to host more gaming tables beyond its initial 450 "if and when necessary," said Galaxy Deputy Chairman  Francis Lui, son of Lui Che Woo.
