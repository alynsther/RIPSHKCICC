The world's largest cellphone maker said it will continue to offer Ovi Music Unlimited subscriptions in China, India, Brazil, Turkey and South Africa, but has stopped producing the devices for other markets. 

There will be no disruption in the service for existing customers, and any Ovi Music Unlimited devices in the retail channel awaiting sale can be activated until Dec. 31, offering 12 months of unlimited track downloads, Nokia said. 

Nokia first launched its mobile music offering, then called "Comes With Music," in 2008, as a rival service to Apple's iPhone and iTunes offerings. Services such as music and navigation have become an increasingly important battleground for makers of mobile handsets. 

Nokia's music service let customers download tracks freely for 12 months to their handsets and keep them after the end of the subscription period. The initiative was supported by a number of major record companies including Universal Music Group, Sony BMG Music Entertainment and  Warner Music Group. 

"We are actively pursuing and planning new music and entertainment services for 2011 with our ecosystem of partners, and will make further announcements at a later date," Nokia said.
