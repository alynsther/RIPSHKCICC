LONDONâ€”Global economic growth appears set to pick up in coming months, led by China, the U.S., France and Japan, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's composite leading indicator. 

The Paris-based think tank Monday said its leading indicator of economic activity in its 33 members rose to 102.8 in November from 102.6 in October, its third straight monthly increase. 

According to the OECD, that sequence points to "an increasing pace of economic expansion," following a period in which growth appeared to have lost momentum. 

"The CLIs for China, the United States, France and Japan show clear signs of accelerating economic activity, while the one for Russia points strongly to steady expansion," the OECD said. 

It added that the measures for Germany, Canada, Italy, the U.K. and India point to a stable rate of growth in coming months. Of the major economies, only Brazil appears set for a slowdown in economic activity, as its CLI fell to 98.6 from 99. 

Taken as a whole, the leading indicators suggest growth in the Group of Seven leading developed economies will pick up, as will growth in the five largest Asian developing economies. 

The OECD's leading indicators are designed to provide early signals of turning points between the expansion and slowdown of economic activity, and are based on a wide variety of data series that have a history of signaling changes in economic activity. 

The November reading will fuel growing optimism about the outlook for the global economy at the start of 2011. It follows the release Thursday of a December survey of 11,000 purchasing managers at businesses in 30 countries around the world that indicated the global economy grew at its fastest pace since April.
