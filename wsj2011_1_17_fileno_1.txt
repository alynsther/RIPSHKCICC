The death toll from flooding and mudslides in southeastern Brazil climbed to at least 626 people on Sunday, as authorities still struggled to reach blocked neighborhoods in mountains north of Rio de Janeiro. 

Enduring yet more rain over the weekend, families continued to gather outside morgues and relief stations for news or to identify the bodies of relatives recovered after last week's downpours. 

Authorities, meanwhile, responded to criticism that they haven't yet been able to get past mud, floodwaters, and rubble to reach some of those affected. 

It still will take days, officials admitted, before recovery workers can better assess casualties and material damages. Authorities remain reluctant to estimate the number of people still missing until they can reach the isolated neighborhoods. 

"It's impossible to know the extent of the catastrophe," James Barros, a colonel from a state police battalion in the region, told the Globo news network. "There are areas where mudslides carried away entire families, with no one left to recognize bodies." 

Amid the recovery, the public outcry over the country's ability to prevent and respond to natural disasters continued. Much of the affected region was known to be vulnerable to flooding. O Estado de S. Paulo, a leading daily newspaper, on Saturday reported that federal officials as recently as November admitted in documents that much of the country's civil-defense network is "unprepared" to respond to such emergencies.

In a statement Sunday, the federal government said President Dilma Rousseff had ordered various government agencies to respond with whatever means necessary to continue helping overwhelmed state and local authorities. In addition to more than 800 soldiers, paramedics, firefighters and other federal relief workers, national authorities have provided helicopters, machinery, and emergency food, medicine, and funding.
