After playing .600 ball down the stretch last season and with promising young studs on their roster, the Baltimore Orioles are seen as a team to be reckoned with in the tough American League East. But the numbers show that a good late charge in one season doesn't necessarily lead to good news the following year.

Since the start of divisional play in 1969, 19 teams have played sub-.500 baseball in the first half of the season before playing at a playoff-caliber .555 clip in the second half. Of those teams, just six were .500 the following year, and just two made the playoffs the next season: the 1987 St. Louis Cardinals and the 2001 Houston Astros. Neither of them won the World Series, though the Cardinals came close, losing in Game 7 to the Minnesota Twins.

Still, after 13 years of losing baseball, Orioles fans are right to have some hope. In 2010, they were a dreadful 25-56 in the first half, but they played .600 baseball (34-23) down the stretch after Buck Showalter took over as manager. They have an elite young catcher in Matt Wieters and a new slugging first baseman in Derrek Lee, and they could look to the San Diego Padres for inspiration. That team rode a hot second half in 2009 to the cusp of the playoffs in 2010.

At the very least, Baltimore could provide a nice payoff to anyone willing to bet they'll win their stacked division. Sportsbook Bodog has set 18-1 odds that the team can take the A.L. East.
