To win the scoring title in men's college basketball, you pretty much need to be a big fish in a small-conference pond. It's nearly impossible for players in the major conferences to do it. The competition is too good, the odds of someone dominating a lesser league too great.

The last player from one of the six current major conferences to lead Division I in scoring was Purdue's Glenn Robinson in 1993-94. (Mr. Robinson averaged 30 points a game.) But that could soon change: UConn guard Kemba Walker is No. 1 nationally at 26.1 points per game. And his closest competitor, Adrian Oliver of San Jose Sate, is well behind (24.4).

College basketball's smaller schools naturally benefit from their greater numbers. Because only 73 of Division I's 345 teams are in the six major conferences, the small schools are more likely to have a few freakish teams that play at an uncommonly fast, high-scoring pace—like Virginia Military Institute, where Reggie Williams led the nation in scoring in 2006-07 and 2007-08. And it's easier for a small-conference star to post gaudy numbers every night, like Gonzaga's Adam Morrison, who beat out Duke's J.J. Redick for the scoring crown in the 2005-06 season. Since the 1996-97 season, only five major-conference players have averaged 25 points a game for a full season.

While Mr. Walker has scored big almost every night this season, whether he can keep it up against the Big East Conference is another story. On Tuesday, Notre Dame held him to a mere 19 points, his lowest output since UConn's season opener.
