 'M-G-M: Hollywood's Greatest Backlot' 

A black-and-white historical peek behind the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studio gates. Its streets and sound stages served as London in "Gaslight" and Munchkinland. It hosted the stateroom scene in "Night at the Opera," the lamppost in "Singin' in the Rain" and a screening room used in shooting "Two Weeks in Another Town" (1962) with a younger Kirk Douglas, at right. Authors Steven Bingen, Stephen X. Sylvester and Michael Troyan were given access to archives, some of them at Warner Bros., which now owns a big chunk of MGM's old film library. 

 'The Event,' NBC, Monday  

It's hard enough to launch a "Lost"-like drama these days, much less relaunch one. But that's what NBC will try to do when it brings back this big-ticket series about a global conspiracy involving a secret alien race. NBC invested heavily in the show when it premiered last fall. Young devotees of such shows tend to watch the episodes in real time, discuss them online and buy the DVD box sets. Some 10.9 million viewers tuned in to the pilot, but ratings plummeted. NBC will air a brief recap of the first 10 episodes before the two-hour episode airs. 

 The Majestic Silver Strings, Thursday 

Four of the baddest guitar slingers in country and experimental jazz are assembling at L.A.'s Grammy Museum for their only scheduled performance following last week's release of their self-titled album. Led by Buddy Miller, pictured here, the Strings also feature New York jazz veterans Marc Ribot and Bill Frisell, and pedal-steel great Greg Leisz. On the album, they work through country classics by George Jones ("Why Baby Why"), Lefty Frizzell ("I Want to Be With You Always") and Roger Miller ("Dang Me"), plus a rousing, lick-trading rendition of "Freight Train."
