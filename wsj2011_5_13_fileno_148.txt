HONG KONG—Hong Kong's economy grew 7.2% in the first quarter from a year earlier, accelerating from the previous quarter's 6.4% expansion on robust domestic and external demand, the government said Friday. 

The first-quarter growth rate was higher than the median 5.3% forecast of nine economists polled earlier by Dow Jones Newswires. 

On a seasonally adjusted basis, the city's gross domestic product in the first quarter grew 2.8% from a quarter earlier, higher than the fourth quarter's 1.5% expansion. It was the eighth consecutive quarterly expansion. 

Given the continued expansion in the first quarter, the government raised its full-year GDP growth forecast for this year to 5% to 6% from its previous forecast of a 4%-5% increase. Last year, Hong Kong's GDP grew 7.0%. 

It raised its forecast for the consumer price index to a 5.4% rise this year from its previous expectation of a 4.5% rise. The price index rose 2.4% last year.
