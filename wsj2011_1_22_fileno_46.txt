"It feels like no one's really cooking for themselves in New York," says  Ben Towill, owner, with childhood friend  Phil Winser, of the Fat Radish, a restaurant at the divey-cool juncture of Chinatown and the Lower East Side. With a playful, seasonal take on British dishes, Messrs. Towill and Winser's new venture (they also run Silkstone catering) aims to bring a touch of home to eating out. 

The Fat Radish, a restaurant at the divey-cool juncture of Chinatown and the Lower East Side, offers a playful, seasonal take on British dishes.

For brunch, that means dishes like the traditional potato hash "bubble and squeak" augmented by Brussels sprouts, collard greens and poached eggs ($12). 

The full English breakfast includes sausages made specially for the restaurant by the Myers of Keswick in the West Village ($15). 

On the sweet side, try the pumpkin pancakes with walnuts and maple mascarpone ($12); pumpkin will be swapped out for other fruit as the seasons change. 

The space connotes romance even during the bleariest of brunches. The dining room is bright and carefully crunchy (white-washed brick walls, herb planters), set deep in the restaurant behind a bar and street-facing juice and coffee bar. 

In early spring, the Fat Radish will start selling fresh produce and bottled versions of its juices, such as greens-and-apple and beet-pear ($6).
