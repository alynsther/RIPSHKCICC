The way this Yankee team is constructed, they need CC Sabathia to be near-perfect every time he pitches—and they've come to assume he will be.

He wasn't quite that on Tuesday night, allowing a moribund Detroit Tiger team to whack 10 hits off him, and that left the Yankees clawing from behind as the Tigers won their first game in a week, 4-2.

The slumping Tigers teed off on Sabathia early, with sub-.200 men Austin Jackson and Magglio Ordonez breaking out against the Yankee ace, who is now 2-2 despite pitching well enough to notch a 2.68 ERA.

The decisive blow came at the hands of Aubrey Huff, who homered off Taylor Buchholz in the 10th inning to hand the Mets a 7-6 loss to the San Francisco Giants. But what cost the Mets a victory Tuesday was everything that led up to it.

R.A. Dickey had one of his worst outings as a Met, giving up six runs on seven hits in six innings. And, with one out and the winning run at third base in the bottom of the ninth, Josh Thole grounded into a double play. The Mets were 2 for 12 with runners in scoring position.

In the first game in New York since the death of Osama bin Laden, the Mets wore blue and white hats with stars and stripes woven into the interlocking NY. The Mets also donated 4,000 game tickets to military members and their families.
