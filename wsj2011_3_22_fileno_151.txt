NEW DELHI â€“  Dell Inc. will focus on three areas to grow its India operations, which are close to fetching $2 billion in revenue, the Texas-based company's chief executive said Tuesday. 

  Michael Dell said the company is expanding its hardware business, developing products and services for education and healthcare sectors and that the personal computer manufacturer will place a third emphasis on managing and servicing its offerings in India. 

"India today offers a fantastic opportunity to use technology for a wide range of applications. We see a tremendous opportunity for growth of the personal computer segment in this country, as the penetration level hovers around just 20-30 PCs per 1,000 people," Mr. Dell said at a technology industry event. 

According to  technology research body IDC, Dell Inc. fell to second position by the end of 2010 in India's overall personal computer sales after two quarters of taking top place. 

Dell Inc., at the end of December, had a 14.2% market share in India's personal computer sales, including desktops and notebooks, trailing  Hewlett-Packard Co.

Mr. Dell separately told reporters at the event that the company plans to add a few thousand employees in India, but he didn't elaborate. 

Dell Inc., which develops, sells and supports computers and related products and services globally, currently employs 23,000 in India. 

Annual personal computer sales in India rebounded in 2010, recording a 30% growth from 2009, when the economic slowdown translated to a 5% fall in sales from the previous year, IDC said in its October-December report.
