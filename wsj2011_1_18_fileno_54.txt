Though Suns point guard Steve Nash once again reminded Knick fans how perfect he is for coach Mike D'Antoni's offense, scoring 15 points with 11 assists in Monday's win over the Knicks, a potential reunion with his former coach is unlikely. Mr. D'Antoni said that he'll have a reunion only when those old Suns teams have a ceremonial reunion in a few years. Suns coach Alvin Gentry was even more direct, saying, "we're not trading him."



By beating the New England Patriots on Sunday, the Jets became the eighth team in the last 20 years to reach back-to-back AFC Championship Games, and there's a bit of history on their side heading into their matchup Sunday against the Steelers. All seven of those previous teams won the second of their two title-game appearances—regardless of how they fared in their first.

In the wake of Sunday's 28-21 victory over the New England Patriots, Jets coach Rex Ryan cited his biggest concern: special teams. Punter Steve Weatherford, in particular, was not at his best. Mr. Weatherford had a 22.3-yard net average on six punts, thanks largely to two touchbacks. Mr. Weatherford was excellent during the regular season, tying an NFL record by dropping 42 punts inside the 20-yard line.
