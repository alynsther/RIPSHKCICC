WASHINGTON--President Barack Obama on Saturday said December's job report shows the economy is trending in the right direction as he urged businesses to take advantage of temporary tax breaks to lift the economy. 

"We know that these numbers can bounce around from month to month," the president said in his weekly radio address Saturday, referring to a jobs report released Friday showing the unemployment rate fell though the economy added fewer-than-expected jobs. He added, "We saw 12 straight months of private-sector job growth--the first time that's been true since 2006." 

The president has continually touted private-sector job growth to bolster his case that his administration's policies have benefited the economy. "Now we're seeing more optimistic economic forecasts for the year ahead, in part due to the package of tax cuts I signed last month," Mr. Obama said. 

Republicans, meanwhile, are trying to take ownership of the tax package, which passed with bipartisan support and extended Bush-era tax breaks that were set to expire at the end of 2010. 

Republicans also had a different interpretation of the jobs report. "House

Republicans intend to use our new majority to focus on creating an economic environment in which employers large and small feel confident enough to hire new workers," said Rep.  Peter Roskam (R., Ill.), a member of the House GOP leadership team, in a statement Friday. 

The president's comments come in a week dominated by a retooling at the White House--including his naming new members to his economic team--as his administration prepares to engage Republicans on reining in government spending.

Still, Mr. Obama said his focus will be doing everything he can to lift the economy. He urged businesses to take advantage of a temporary provision that allows them to expense 100% of capital purchases.
