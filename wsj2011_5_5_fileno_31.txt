The energy sector led stocks lower as crude-oil prices tumbled and jobs data disappointed.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 139.41 points, or 1.1%, to 12584.17. The measure's energy components weighed, with  Exxon Mobil

 down 2.06, or 2%, to 102.62, as crude settled below $100 a barrel, off 8.6% on the day.

The Nasdaq Composite declined 13.51 points, or 0.5%, to 2814.72. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index shed 12.22 points, or 0.9%, to 1335.10, with its energy sector leading to the downside, marking the measure's fourth consecutive drop. It represents the first time the S&P 500 has been down for the first four days of a month since October 2008.

The tumble in crude came as investors rushed to the safety of the dollar after data showed new claims for jobless benefits unexpectedly surged last week to the highest level since August.

"The dollar's flying and oil's getting crushed," said  Dave Rovelli, managing director of U.S. equity trading at Canaccord Genuity. "There's a flight to safety; the risk trade is off." 

Still, the Dow Jones Transportation Average jumped 1.1% as shares of transportation companies rose on the prospect of lower energy costs.  FedEx

 surged 75 cents, or 7.2%, to 11.22. 

Shares of some retailers also climbed after same-store sales reports showed momentum aided by the Easter holiday, while Thursday's drop in commodities also eased worries over the impact on consumer spending from high gasoline prices.

Macy's rose 95 cents, or 3.7%, to 26.35, while Target added 1.14, or 2.3%, to 50.34.

 jumped 1.38, or 6.9%, to 21.38, after the maker of products for telecommunications companies, cable operators and network-equipment manufacturers, swung to a fiscal third-quarter profit, topping analysts' estimates as revenue jumped sharply. 

  Electronic Arts gained 1.76, or 8.8%, to 21.68, after the videogame maker's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings more than quintupled. 

  BMC Software added 2.19, or 4.5%, to 51.26, following an increase in its fiscal fourth-quarter profit on better-than-expected revenue growth and wider operating margins. 

  Whole Foods Market was another bright spot. The natural-foods grocer's fiscal second-quarter earnings rose as same-store sales increased and gross margins expanded in what the company said were the strongest results in five years. Its stock edged up 21 cents, or 0.4%, to 59.95. 

Aeropostale plunged 4.20, or 16%, to 21.29, after the teen-apparel retailer trimmed its fiscal first-quarter profit outlook on lower-than-expected sales and margins.

In deal news,  Kendle International surged 5.48, or 58%, to 14.98, after closely held INC Research agreed to buy the company for $232 million. The deal, which will merge two global contract research organizations that intend to focus on therapeutics, values Kendle's shares at a 61% premium over its Wednesday closing price.
