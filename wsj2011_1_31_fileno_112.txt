Getting in to Red Rooster, chef Marcus Samuelsson's bright new eatery, is a tough squeeze. Harlem's hot hangout is packed with neighborhood folks and boldface names nightly, making a dinner table hard to come by. 

So, go for lunch, when you can have much of the same menu—a bit uptown and a bit Scandinavian, but essentially all caloric comfort. 

Start with the savory and sweet spinach and crab soup with honeydew melon and coconut milk (with the cornbread it's a fine lunch). For a main, there's gravlax, shrimp with red grits, Helga's Meatballs, named for the owner's grandmother, or the "Fried Yard Bird," a tremendous pile of spicy chicken with an even spicier mace gravy and collard greens. 

The desserts are just as inventive as the main courses; the sweet potato doughnuts with cinnamon sugar and the warm apple pie with cheddar crust are standouts.

Sandwiches and entrees are $13 to $18, and there is also a $17 daily lunch deal that includes an appetizer, a main course and a dessert, such as a cupcake.
