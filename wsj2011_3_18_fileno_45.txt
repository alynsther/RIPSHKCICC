Bi Lokma, which means "one bite" in Turkish, is a tiny new outpost serving Turkish cuisine in Midtown East.

Chef Orhan Yegen named his new restaurant Bi Lokma, which means "one bite" in Turkish. It's an apt name for the small outpost of about 16 seats serving the Grand Central worker-bee crowd. A large part of its business comes from big orders from nearby companies. 

The Turkish fare, flavorful and hearty, is served in generous portions. Appetizers include borek (filo stuffed with feta cheese), piyaz (white kidney beans, red bell peppers in olive oil and lemon juice) and lahmajun (thin crust dough topped with minced lamb and spices). Main courses include chicken shish kebab and musakka (layers of eggplant with ground lamb). For dessert, a good combination is Turkish tea and almond pudding.

Main courses range from $8.50 to $9.50; appetizers are $3 to $14.50. 

"I don't have the most beautiful restaurant, but I have the most beautiful food," said Mr. Yegen, also owner of Sip Sak.
