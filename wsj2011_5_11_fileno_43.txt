The Museum of Modern Art agreed Tuesday to purchase the American Folk Art Museum's building, allowing the Folk Art Museum to eliminate its bond debt, and MoMA to significantly expand its exhibition space.

A spokeswoman for the Folk Art Museum confirmed the sale late Tuesday, after its board voted in favor of it. The price of the sale is undisclosed. The Folk Art museum is in default on nearly $32 million of bonds. 



The Folk Art Museum plans to continue to present exhibitions and public programs at Lincoln Square, a gallery space near Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, which the museum has operated since 1989.

MoMA has had the right of first refusal on the space, which is next door to its home on West 53rd Street. MoMA doesn't have immediate plans for the space, as the deal was completely very quickly, but ultimately plans to use it for additional exhibition space, according to a person familiar with the matter. 

"[T]his also remains a time of considerable financial challenge for the museum," Folk Art board President Laura Parsons said in a letter to its trustees Tuesday. 

"Efforts to balance our budget and bring meaningful fiscal stability to the museum's annual operations have been effective, but we have made little progress in raising the substantial funds necessary to satisfy the bond on our West 53rd Street building," the letter said. "The constant burden of servicing and paying down this debt imperils the institution and distracts the museum's board and staff from our pursuit of programmatic excellence." The museum's executive director, Maria Ann Conelli, said on its website last week that she would step down in July.
