European stocks fell sharply Thursday, as nervous investors grappled with weak data from China and the U.S., a downgrade of Spain's credit rating and escalating tension in Libya. The euro lost ground against the dollar, while oil and gold prices fell in tandem. 

The Stoxx Europe 600 index slid 1.2% to 277.88. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 index fell 1.6% to 5845.29, France's CAC-40 index shed 0.8% to 3963.99 and Germany's DAX fell 1% to 7063.09. 

In the U.S., stock indexes also tumbled. In afternoon trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 212 points, or 1.7%, at 12001.03. The Standard & Poor's 500 shed 1.7% to 1297.5, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was also off 1.7% at 2706.22.

Disappointing Chinese data set the tone for Thursday's session in Europe. China posted a $7.3 billion trade deficit in February, against expectations for a surplus, as growth in exports and imports slowed sharply. The news weighed most heavily on basic-resource issues, as investors worried about a potential slowdown in demand from one of the world's largest consumers of commodities. The Stoxx Europe 600 index for the sector ended down 3.2%. 

Meanwhile, the downbeat mood was compounded by Moody's Investors Service's downgrade of Spanish government debt to Aa2 with a negative outlook, from Aa1. Moody's also warned over the potential for further downgrades, citing the high costs associated with restructuring Spain's banking system.

Banks with exposure to some of Europe's weakest economies declined, including Allied Irish Banks, which dropped more than 7% in Dublin.

Munich Re, the world's largest reinsurer, fell 1.4% in Frankfurt after it cast doubt on its 2011 profit target, saying it would achieve it only if the cost of disaster claims falls to below the long-term average for the rest of 2011.

The afternoon session brought no relief, as investors were served up another helping of doom and gloom in the form of disappointing U.S. initial jobless claims and trade-balance data. New jobless claims rose by 26,000 to 397,000 last week, versus expectations of a 7,000 increase. Meanwhile, figures showed that the U.S. trade gap widened sharply in January, to its highest level in seven months. 

The euro fell heavily across the board following Spain's downgrade, but managed to recover a little ground later in the day. By the time the European stock markets closed, the common currency was trading at $1.3815 from $1.3904 late Wednesday. 

Late in Europe, light, sweet crude for April delivery was down $3.09 at $101.29 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Gold for April delivery was down 1.5% at $1407.65 per troy ounce late in Europe on the Comex division of Nymex.

Mining stocks also dropped after the Chinese data. BHP Billiton sank 3.5% and Rio Tinto fell 3.8%.

In London, the FTSE held on to its losses after the Bank of England maintained its key interest rate at 0.5%.

Belgium's Delhaize was among the relatively few gainers in Europe. The stock rallied 4.1% after the supermarket operator reported a 42% jump in fourth-quarter profit and an improving trend in its U.S. business.

Technology stocks were among the weakest performers. U.K. chip maker ARM Holdings sank 9% after a bearish broker note from J.P. Morgan Cazenove, which said the company is the most at risk from recent negative industry data.
