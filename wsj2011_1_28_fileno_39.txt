Tiger Woods spent last year developing a new swing with coach Sean Foley, but it was his short game that held him up Thursday on the North Course at Torrey Pines. Playing in his first competitive round of the season, Mr. Woods missed a half-dozen birdie putts from within 15 feet on his way to a 69, putting him at three under par, and three shots off the Farmers Insurance Open lead at the time he walked off the course. After dropping a birdie putt on his 15th hole, (Mr. Woods began his round on the back-nine) and pitching to seven feet on the 16th, a late-round birdie run looked likely. But the putt drifted and his two final drives missed the fairway. "I kept leaving myself above the hole," Mr. Woods said. "You can't do that on these greens." Mr. Woods will play the more difficult South Course Friday. He has won eight times at Torrey Pines, including the 2008 U.S. Open.

When Timothy Bradley fights Devon Alexander in Pontiac, Mich., on Saturday (HBO, 10 p.m. ET), it will be an ultra-rare bout. Mr. Bradley is 26-0 and the World Boxing Organization 140-pound champion. Mr. Alexander is 21-0 and holds the World Boxing Council light welterweight title. The last time two undefeated American world-title-belt holders squared off was Mike Tyson against Tony Tucker in 1987, according to the boxing database Boxrec.com. Mr. Tyson's unanimous 12-round decision over Mr. Tucker, at the time, unified the heavyweight division. Today, there are three heavyweights holding belts—Vitali Klitschko, Wladimir Klitschko and David Haye.
