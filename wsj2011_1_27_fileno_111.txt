According to TVB, the other investors that have agreed to buy the stake are private equity firm Providence Equity Partners LLC and Taiwanese businesswoman  Cher Wang, chairman of HTC Corp.

The investors couldn't be reached for comment. 

The broadcaster said 103-year-old  Sir Run Run will remain as chairman of the company after the share sale, while three new board members will also be nominated, including Ms. Wang and Mr. Chan, who had earlier invested in TVB's Hong Kong pay-TV venture. 

Sir Run Run has made no secret of his intention to bow out of TVB, a company he co-founded more than 40 years ago. For several years, he has sought buyers for his stake. In 2009, he gave up his executive duties to assume a nonexecutive chairmanship role, leaving his wife,  Mona Fong, to oversee the broadcaster's day-to-day operations.

TVB commands about 85% market share in the free broadcast segment, against competitor Asia Television Ltd., which isn't listed. 

Once completed, the sale of the TVB stake would represent Sir Run Run's final farewell to the motion-picture and television empire he helped build in Hong Kong starting in the 1950s. He also owns a 6.23% stake in TVB through the Shaw Foundation Hong Kong Ltd. TVB said Wednesday, the Shaw Foundation will sell a portion of its stake to independent third parties before the completion of Shaw Brothers's TVB stake sale.
