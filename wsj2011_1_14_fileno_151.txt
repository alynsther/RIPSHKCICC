The Seahawks might be one of the all-time worst NFL playoff teams, but if Seattle manages to beat the Chicago Bears on Sunday, it will also own another place in history: the first squad in at least 30 years to win two playoff games despite being double-digit underdogs in both. If that does happen, though, the Seahawks shouldn't expect any newfound respect from Las Vegas. In a potential NFC Championship tilt against the Falcons, according to Bodog.com, Atlanta would open as 10.5-point favorites. In a Seattle-Green Bay matchup, the Packers would be favored on the road—but only by seven points.

 It's a good year to win the Australian Open, which starts Monday in Melbourne. The winner of the men's and women's singles titles will receive $2.2 million Australian dollars ($2.19 million), making it the largest payout in Grand Slam history. Not bad for an event that was once the pudgy kid brother of the other three majors. Eleven-time Slam winner Björn Borg, you'll recall, only played the tournament once, losing in the third round in 1974.
