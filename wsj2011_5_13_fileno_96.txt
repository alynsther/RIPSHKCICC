 Sonoma Coast, Calif.  Vintage: 2008  Alcohol: 12.1%  Price: Around €25 or £25

What a find. Based in the Russian River Valley, Pam and Pax Mahle's Wind Gap focuses on small plots of vineyards. Given the quality of the wines, the estate has all the hallmarks of a cult winery in the making. This wine really impressed with its restraint, elegance and finesse; a Syrah that wouldn't look out of place amid a line-up of some of the finest examples from the northern Rhône. The nose is replete with white pepper, a little spice and an inviting cherry character. The palate is fresh, with ripe tannins. If this is California taking on France at its own game, it is also an example of it winning.
