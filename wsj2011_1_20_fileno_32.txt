They're baaack. If you can recall the clomp, clomp, clomp of wooden clogs back in the day, then you know what we're talking about. Proof positive that the 1970s still rule fashion this season, fast-fashion retailer H&M is today announcing a collaboration with the shoe label Swedish Hasbeens.

Three updated, but relentlessly wood-soled styles will be available beginning April 20 in H&M stores worldwide. "Using handcrafted methods and environmentally friendly materials, Swedish Hasbeens are a perfect example of how fashion and fun can also be naturally sustainable," the company says in a press release. 

As a style trend, the seventies have cropped up repeatedly over the past four to five years, returning peasant blouses, fringed suede bags, and stringy hair to the modern fashion lexicon.

Swedish Hasbeens was founded in 2007 by childhood friends Cilla Wingård Neuman and Emy Blixt, after Emy decided the '70s clogs were due to be revived. Since then, the shoes have been worn by enough celebrities to call it a cult—even  Sarah Jessica Parker has worn them. 

The H&M versions will come in multiple colors. Attached to the familiar wooden soles are three styles of uppers: gladiators (now there's another fashion with a long shelf life), a summer sandal, and a lace-up version of a clog with a heel. They're priced from $59.95-$69.95.
