LIMAâ€”The campaign for president in Peru has become less of an ideological battle and more of a sort of variety show, said  Mario Vargas Llosa, a one-time presidential candidate and Nobel laureate. 

The race for president in Peru has entered into the last two weeks before the April 10 election and pollsters say five candidates have a shot at gaining enough votes to enter into a run off between the two candidates with the most votes. 

"The most painful thing is that in this campaign there hasn't been an ideological struggle. There has been a tournament of clownish like behaviors but very little ideological struggle," Mr.  Vargas Llosa said in a TV broadcast late Sunday. 

Mr. Vargas Llosa ran for president in Peru in 1990 but lost in a run off vote to now-jailed ex-President  Alberto Fujimori. Mr. Vargas Llosa won the Nobel prize for literature in 2010. Following his unsuccessful bid to lead Peru politically, Vargas Llosa has refrained from being a candidate in subsequent elections. 

"I think that politics in Peru have gone from being an ideological mediocrity to being sadly one of being the politics of spectacles. In this campaign we have seen this in a flagrant manner, as the show is the most important," he added. 

In his run for office in Peru in 1990, Vargas Llosa espoused center-right policies, and has written extensively in his novels about dictatorships. 

Pollster Ipsos-Apoyo said left-leaning nationalist leader Ollanta Humala is in first place in voter intentions at 21% with former President Alejandro Toledo in second at 20%. The poll shows Congresswoman Keiko Fujimori in third place with 19%, followed by ex-Prime Minister Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, with 15%, and then former Lima mayor Luis Castaneda with 14%.
