It may be faster to rent a car at the airport, but you'll likely pay for the convenience.

Instead, consider taking a taxi to a rental location outside an airport. Renting offsite typically will save you about 25%, says  Jill Rosenberg, travel spokeswoman for AAA New York.

That's because you'll pay a lower rental base fee offsite and skirt airport taxes.  Darren Koch, general manager of CarRentals.com, says most airports also have a facilities fee.

When Sunday Journal reader  Leah Pearson booked a midsize car for seven days for Labor Day week, the lowest price she could find at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport was $630 -- $435 base price plus $195 in taxes and fees. But a Budget Rent A Car less than five miles away in Kent, Wash., had the same car for a $147 base rate and $36 in taxes and fees, for a total of $183.

Similarly, a compact-size car rented for four days during the July 4 weekend through Hertz at Orlando International Airport costs $352, with $298 for the rental and $54 in taxes and fees. Just 13 miles away, an Enterprise Rent-A-Car shop has the same size car for $123 -- $105 base price and $18 in taxes and fees.

In addition to free-standing locations for various rental companies, you can find Avis Rent A Car facilities inside some Sears auto centers.
