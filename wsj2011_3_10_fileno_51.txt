Jamal Olasewere scored seven of his 31 points in overtime and Long Island University earned its first NCAA tournament bid in 14 years with an overtime victory over two-time defending champion Robert Morris in the Northeast Conference title game Wednesday night.

Russell Johnson, who made a 3-pointer for the Colonials to send the game to OT, missed a potential tying 3 with the clock winding down. The rebound bounced out of bounds with 0.6 seconds left, but Johnson missed a 3 at the buzzer.
