Gokaldas Exports Ltd. will appoint  Gautam Chakravarti, a nominee of majority stakeholder Blackstone Group, as chief executive officer in April, the Indian apparel exporter's managing director said Thursday.

"As per our agreement [with Blackstone], we wanted to retire,"  Rajendra Hinduja told Dow Jones Newswires. "For the last two-and-a-half years we have been training new professionals to take charge of the company."

Gokaldas Exports last month informed the Indian stock exchanges that it appointed Gautam Chakravarti as an additional director. In January, Madanlal Hinduja retired as executive chairman of the company.

Public shareholding in Gokaldas Exports is low as the founder and founder groups own 88.27% of the company--with Blackstone FP Capital Partners (Mauritius) V-B Ltd. holding 68.27% and the Hinduja family holding a 20% stake as of March 31.

U.S.-based private-equity firm Blackstone bought a majority stake in Gokaldas Exports in 2007.
