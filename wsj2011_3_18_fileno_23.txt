' west India plant have been on strike since Wednesday, opposing a recent wage settlement pact, P. Balendran, vice president of the company, said Friday. 

The employees stopped work at the Halol plant without prior notice from the second shift on March 16, the company said. 

Government authorities intervened and after looking into the details, have declared the strike illegal. 

The striking workers are threatening and attempting to stop other employees who are willing to work and forcing them to join them, according to the company, which described the actions as improper, unreasonable and illegal and said it would be forced to take legal action against such workers. 

In December 2010 the company signed a wage settlement agreement for three years, covering salary increases and productivity-related matters with the employees' union. 

General Motors India makes various models of the Chevrolet brand of cars at its Halol facility. 

The plant produces 95 vehicles in a single shift and employs 900 workers.
