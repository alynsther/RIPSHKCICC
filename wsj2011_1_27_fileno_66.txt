PARK CITY, Utah—Sundance has its It Girls, one of whom is Brit Marling, a Georgetown economics graduate with two films that premiered here this week. She wrote, starred in and produced both. 

In the first, "Another Earth," which has science fiction overtones, she stars as a former convict who develops a relationship with the man whose life she changed before she went to prison. In the second, "Sound of My Voice," she is a cult leader.

As a college junior, Ms. Marling interned at Goldman Sachs. At the end of that summer, she participated in a 48-hour film festival. Making a film short that weekend was "like working investment-banking hours," but ultimately more gratifying, she said at the premiere party for "Another Earth" this week. "I knew I wanted to get better at telling stories."

Ms. Marling, who currently lives in Los Angeles, said that "Another Earth" was so low-budget the production couldn't afford to shoot in a prison. To get a shot where her character in the film is being released from jail, "I had to walk into a prison and say I was there to teach yoga," recalled Ms. Marling. "When they went to check if I was supposed to be there, we quickly shot the scene, I dropped the yoga mat and left. So the scene was the cost of a yoga mat. It's all in the spirit of illegal independent filmmaking."

Ms. Marling added she wasn't sure what all the fuss at Sundance would lead to. "But maybe it becomes a splinter that makes it easier to make the next project," she offered.
