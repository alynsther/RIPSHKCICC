Spanish stocks surged again, led by gains for banks after a successful government bond auction, while other European markets finished lower.

The Stoxx Europe 600 index fell 0.6% to close at 284.04, while the IBEX 35 index jumped 2.7% to 10370.80 in Madrid after the Spanish government sold about €3 billion ($3.94 billion) of five-year bonds, with yields rising, but demand also strengthening. 

The Spanish stock index has advanced sharply in the last three sessions, helped by successful debt auctions at home and in Portugal, supportive comments from China and Japan, and an apparently increased willingness by European politicians to tackle the sovereign-debt crisis. 

"Spain had been seen to be next in the firing line behind Portugal, so anything that reduces the chances of a Portuguese bailout must have a knock-on effect for Spain," said  Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec. 

  Manoj Ladwa, senior trader at ETX Capital, added that the heavy weighting of financial stocks in the Spanish index contributed to the strong gains.  Banco Santander rose 4.8%, and  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria

 added 2.9%, helping the CAC 40 index rise 0.8% to 3974.83. French banks are seen as some of the most exposed to economies on the periphery of the euro zone.

 It dropped 1.2% in Frankfurt after the bank said it plans to increase its share capital by as much as 10%. The fall kept a lid on the performance of the German DAX 30 index, which finished up just 0.1% at 7075.11. 

The U.K.'s FTSE 100 closed 0.4% lower at 6023.88. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was about 0.1% lower at 11737 around the European close; the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was roughly flat at 1285.73.

Decisions by the Bank of England and the European Central Bank to keep interest rates unchanged had little effect on stocks, as the markets had anticipated those decisions. However, ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet emphasized that the central bank would be closely monitoring inflation. 

"While Trichet was rather close-lipped on the sovereign-debt crisis and possible new measures by EU leaders in the coming weeks, he sent a slightly more hawkish message on monetary policy," said  Carsten Brzeski of ING. "According to the ECB, interest rates remain 'still' appropriate, suggesting that this is not self-evident anymore."

Italy also completed a bond auction Thursday, selling €6 billion of debt. 

In Milan, the FTSE MIB index gained 0.9% to close at 21308.  Fondiaria Sai soared more than 17% after French insurer Groupama expressed an interest in acquiring a stake of as much as 20% in the Italian car insurer ﻿. 

In the European foreign exchanges, the euro extended its gains against the dollar and the yen after the single currency's surge Wednesday. 

In afternoon trade, the euro was at $1.3321, up from $1.3133 in late New York trade Wednesday. The dollar was at 82.87 yen, down from 82.97 yen.

By the close of European equity markets, spot gold on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange was down $3.40 per troy ounce at $1,382.40. Light, sweet, crude for January delivery was up $0.35 at $92.21 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Looking ahead to Friday, consumer-price index data are due from Germany and the broader euro zone. The U.S. also publishes CPI, along with retail sales, industrial production data and the University of Michigan's confidence survey.
