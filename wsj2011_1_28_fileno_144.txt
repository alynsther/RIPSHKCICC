SINGAPORE—Singapore Airlines Ltd. said Friday its fiscal third-quarter net profit fell 28.6% from a year earlier after the company set aside money to pay fines for alleged price fixing by its cargo unit, while adding that tapering advance passenger bookings and rising fuel costs are clouding its outlook. 

Net profit for the three months ended Dec. 31 fell to $288.3 million Singapore dollars from S$403.7 million Singapore dollars ($315.7 million) a year earlier, the airline said in a statement. The result was lower than the S$371 million profit forecast in a Dow Jones Newswires poll of five analysts. 

The exceptional items of S$199.1 million comprised provisions made for fines payable by SIA Cargo as imposed by the European Commission (S$135.7 million), the South Korean Fair Trade Commission (S$3.6 million) and the United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division (S$62.5 million), the airline said, adding it has appealed the decisions by European Commission and the Korean body. 

In November, the European Commission fined 11 air cargo carriers a total of €799 million, or about $1.1 billion, for price-fixing in cargo services. Singapore Airlines contested that it was involved in a global conspiracy to fix surcharges or rates. 

In the following month, the carrier said it had agreed to pay an antitrust fine to the U.S. Department of Justice, bringing to a close an investigation into an alleged conspiracy to fix prices from 2002 until at least February 2006. 

On its outlook, it said: "As airlines including SIA continue to inject capacity, advance passenger bookings for the final quarter of the 2010-11 financial year are levelling off." 

Singapore Airlines said operating profit in the quarter was 58% higher on year at S$509 million while group revenue grew 12% to S$3.84 billion. Expenditure rose 8% to S$3.33 billion. 

Fuel costs remained the biggest expense item, rising 7.8% to S$1.11 billion, the carrier said, adding that "jet fuel prices are at two year highs and trending up." 

The airline raised fuel surcharges from Jan. 27 by as much as US$27 per ticket due to a recent sharp and "sustained" increase in jet fuel prices. 

For the nine months to December 2010, Singapore Airlines recorded net profit of S$921 million, a turnaround from the S$62 million loss in the same period the previous year, it said. 

Group revenue rose 17% to S$10.94 billion while expenditure rose at a slower rate of 3% to S$9.83 billion. 

During the quarter, Singapore Airlines took delivery of two Airbus A330-300s, taking its operating fleet to 109 aircraft as at Dec. 31. with an average age of six years and two months.
