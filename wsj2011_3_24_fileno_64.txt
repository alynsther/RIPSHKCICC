Stocks rose in relatively light volume, led by materials companies, though a bank-dividend disappointment and worries over several overseas trouble spots kept investor sentiment in check. 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 67.39 points, or 0.6%, to 12086.02, for its fourth gain in the last five sessions. The measure was led by  Alcoa,

 led decliners as it shed 23 cents, or 1.7%, to 13.65, after the Federal Reserve rejected the bank's plan to boost its dividend.

The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 3.77 points, or 0.3%, to 1297.54, also staging its fourth gain in five days. The S&P was led by its materials sector, while financial stocks lagged behind. The Nasdaq Composite rose 14.43 points, or 0.5%, to 2698.30. 

Stocks hit session lows after data showed that U.S. new-home sales in February hit a record low, underscoring the weak housing market. But the market rose midsession in light volume that showed bulls weren't out in full force. A below-average 3.9 billion shares traded hands in New York Stock Exchange composite volume.

"This is a little bit of a continued bounce back from overselling as a result of the Japanese tsunami and problems in the Middle East," said  Nathan Rowader, director of investments at Forward Management.

Materials stocks gained in moves that investors linked to the view that Japan's reconstruction could be costly, a boost to companies that produce commodities like aluminum, steel and copper. 

"The amount of money that Japan is going to need to rebuild, the estimates are rising," said  Robert Haber, chief executive officer of Haber Trilix Advisors. Japan's government said that damage from the earthquake and tsunami could be more than double the cost of the 1995 Kobe earthquake. 

The Middle East and North Africa continued to deliver worrisome news, helping oil stay above $105 a barrel. Another concern came from Portugal. That country's Parliament rejected austerity measures just as U.S. markets were closing. Some investors had predicted the government's collapse if the measures failed.
