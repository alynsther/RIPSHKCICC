LONDON—U.K. gross mortgage lending grew at the same pace in February as in January, suggesting the housing market will stay subdued as a cloudy economic outlook keeps prospective buyers away from the market. 

Gross mortgage lending grew by £9.5 billion ($15.33 billion), the same increase as in January, the Council of Mortgage Lenders said Friday, 

The lending growth figures for January and February are the lowest since February 2010. January's figure was revised up from £9.2 billion previously. 

"The housing market remains stuck in a rut," said  Bob Pannell, chief economist at the council. "This is going to be a challenging year for households and the housing market." 

Mortgage lending is a key forward-looking indicator for house prices, which have fluctuated in early 2011 following a modest rebound in 2010. 

The CML predicted the housing market would continue to struggle this year as the government presses ahead with its ambitious £111 billion program of spending cuts and tax rises. The likelihood of higher interest rates will also damp activity, it said. 

"Looming fiscal changes will add to the pressure on household finances, while the prospect of modest base-rate increases, perhaps starting as early as May, suggests residential property transactions for the year may disappoint," Mr. Pannell said. 

The Bank of England is widely expected to begin raising interest rates from their all-time low of 0.5% later this year, possibly as early as May, in an attempt to bring inflation back to target. 

Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, in his budget on March 23, is expected to shift focus away from the government's austerity plans and toward its strategy for supporting growth.
