BRUSSELS—The North Atlantic Treaty Organization decided Friday that conditions had been met for its involvement in military action against Libya, and said it would continue planning to this end.

The decision follows a United Nations Security Council resolution Thursday authorizing "all necessary measures" to protect Libyan citizens.

However, diplomats said the alliance had taken no formal decision to get involved, though a number of NATO countries, including France, Spain and Britain, have said they would. Meetings by the alliance's decision making body—the North Atlantic Council, which comprises ambassadors to NATO from the alliance's 28 member governments—would likely continue into the weekend.

NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said NATO "is now completing planning in order to be ready to take appropriate action."

Alliance defense ministers meeting last week set three conditions for NATO's involvement in military action: a demonstrable need, a clear legal basis and support from the region. Planning continues on ways to provide humanitarian assistance, enforce an arms embargo and impose a no-fly zone, the diplomats said. Planning wasn't complete on how to manage the no-fly zone, one diplomat said.

NATO takes decisions by consensus, meaning that if any of the alliance's members object, the alliance can't get involved. Diplomats said questions surrounded particularly the positions of Germany, which abstained Thursday on the U.N. resolution, and Turkey, which had voiced its opposition to a no-fly zone. The two had not blocked further planning, however.

Military action could go ahead without a NATO agreement, but the organization has joint command and control and surveillance assets in the region that may allow the operation to be mounted more quickly.
