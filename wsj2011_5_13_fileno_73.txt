 'A Time to Kill,' Arena Stage, Washington, in performances now through June 19  

Actors address theatergoers as though they are members of the jury in the rural South in this first-ever stage adaptation of a John Grisham novel, this one his debut, published in 1989. The action takes place largely in a courtroom, with the set rotating on a turntable so audiences can see the trial from different angles. Mr. Grisham has read the script but hasn't seen the show yet, says Arena artistic director Molly Smith, who expects the best-selling novelist at the play's opening May 22. 

 'Celebrating 100 Years: The Centennial Exhibition,' New York Public Library, Saturday through Dec. 31 

Today's e-books and budget cuts notwithstanding, the lion-guarded New York library will always have its past. It shows off its deep collection of historic and cultural memorabilia, including a 1911 letter from Houdini to the first library director, J.S. Billings, as the magician bestowed some books about handcuffs and his collection of "Conjurer's Monthly"; a pair of Jack Kerouac's glasses; Virginia Woolf's last diary entry; and a 1978 typescript of Bob Dylan's underappreciated "Changing of the Guards" with handwritten edits. 

 Bergdorf Goodman, Fifth Avenue, NYC 

The windows at Bergdorf Goodman department store are still festooned, through Sunday anyway (last chance alert), with "Selections From the Archives of Alexander McQueen." They've been a kind of companion piece to "Savage Beauty," the exhibit of the late English designer's work 25 blocks north at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which levies a "recommended" $20 fee and runs through July. Added bonus: Across the street from Bergdorf's in front of the Plaza Hotel is "Circle of Animals/Zodiac Heads" by Chinese dissident artist Ai Weiwei. Two for the price of...none.
