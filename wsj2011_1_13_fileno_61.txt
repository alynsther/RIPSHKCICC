The year 2010 has tied 2005 as the Earth's warmest on record, according to an assessment by U.S. government scientists.

Researchers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said the combined global land and ocean surface temperature for 2010 was 1.12 degrees Fahrenheit (0.62 degrees Celsius) above the 20th-century average. 

In each of the last 34 years, the global temperature has been above the 20-century average, NOAA said. 

Nine of the 10 warmest years on record have occurred since 2001. The exception was 1998, the third-warmest.

The record compiled by NOAA is based on data from hundreds of land-based weather stations and ships and buoys at sea, sent by more than 200 countries. The data go back to 1880.

The latest findings were seen by some as further evidence of a link between human activities and global warming.

"In my mind, it reinforces the notion that we're seeing a signal from increasing greenhouse-gas emissions," said David Easterling, a NOAA researcher. "If that weren't a fact, we'd see temperatures tapering off and cooling, but we're not seeing that."

Not all scientists agreed. John Christy, a climatologist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, said natural long-term variability in climate, rather than greenhouse-gas emissions, could play a greater role in warming.

In addition, Dr. Christy said, "If greenhouse gases are causing warming, the climate system is not very sensitive to carbon dioxide because the warming is not very dramatic."

Dr. Christy helped develop a global temperature data set based on satellite measurements going back to 1979. His approach indicates that 1998 was the warmest year. 

Dr. Christy noted that despite disagreement about how fast the earth is warming, most scientists agree global temperatures are, indeed, rising.

In July, an international study by 300 scientists concluded that the Earth has been getting warmer over the past 50 years and that the past decade was the warmest on record. 

Those conclusions broadly matched the findings of the most recent report by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, published in 2007.

This week, Canada's environmental agency said 2010 was the country's warmest year, with the average temperature 3 degrees Celsius above the normal since records began in 1948.

Meanwhile, the Finnish government said 2010 was the country's coolest year since 1987. at 0.6% below average.Yet the decade 2001-2010 was Finland's warmest, based on records going back to the 1840s.

Dr. Easterling said unusually cold temperatures for a single year or two didn't undermine evidence of a warming planet. "Climate change is a global and long-term phenomenon," he said.

In its latest report, NOAA also noted that 2010 was the wettest year on record globally since 1900, though patterns varied from region to region. The United Kingdom, for example, recorded its driest January-to-June period since 1953 and the second-driest since 1929, while Pakistan was hit by the worst floods seen in a generation.

The contiguous U.S. recorded its 14th consecutive year when the annual temperature was above the long-term average, while precipitation in 2010 was 1.02 inches (2.59 centimeters) above the long-term average.

The NOAA study also found that global ocean-surface temperatures for 2010 were tied with 2005 as the third-warmest on record. Global land-surface temperatures for 2010 were the warmest on record, at 1.80 degree Fahrenheit (1.0 degree Celsius) above the 20th-century average.
