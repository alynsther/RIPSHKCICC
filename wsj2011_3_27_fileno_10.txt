BRUSSELSâ€”The top military committee of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization approved plans Sunday for the takeover of all international military operations in and around Libya, diplomats said.

The technical decision, which approves operational plans put together by military planners over the previous two days, opens the way for a political decision by NATO's key decision-making body, the North Atlantic Council. That could come as soon as Sunday evening at a scheduled meeting of the NAC, which comprises the ambassadors to NATO of the 28 member nations.

The alliance's phased takeover of the no-fly zone is already underway, after agreement late Thursday for NATO to take responsibility for that part of the operation. NATO is also enforcing an arms embargo on the country.
