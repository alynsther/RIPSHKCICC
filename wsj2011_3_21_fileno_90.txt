St. John's women's basketball team, coming off Saturday's 55-50 win over Texas Tech in the first round of the NCAA tournament, will get a much bigger test when they face No. 1 seed Stanford (30-2) at 9:30 p.m. Monday in Palo Alto, Calif. Sophomore point guard Nadirah McKenith (pictured above) led all scorers with 14 points in the Red Storm's win over the Red Raiders. Monday's game marks the second straight year that St. John's (22-10) has made it to the second round. But the Red Storm has never made it to the Sweet 16.
