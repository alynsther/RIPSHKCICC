PARIS—Unemployment in France fell slightly in the fourth quarter of 2010, giving some cheer to President Nicolas Sarkozy who has made fighting unemployment a key battleground ahead of presidential elections in May 2012. 

The unemployment rate fell to 9.2% from 9.3% in the third quarter, national statistics agency Insee said Thursday. Including overseas territories, the unemployment rate fell to 9.6% in the fourth quarter from 9.7% in the third quarter. 

Facing record lows in opinion polls, Mr. Sarkozy has promised to dedicate much of his work this year to bringing down unemployment. He recently announced a plan to divert €500 million ($693.4 million) to the labor ministry from other ministries to fund initiatives to reduce youth and long term unemployment. 

Earlier this week French Prime Minister  François Fillon said the target of reducing unemployment in 2011 is "clearly within reach." He proposed cutting fixed levies employers pay for the lowest earners and slashing paperwork required for appointments. 

The unemployment rate amongst 15-to-24-year-olds fell to 22.3% in the fourth quarter from 24.2% in the third quarter, while the rate those aged 25 to 49 rose to 8.5% from 8.4%, Insee said. 

The rate of permanent contracts didn't increase in the fourth quarter, while temporary contracts increased, Insee said.
