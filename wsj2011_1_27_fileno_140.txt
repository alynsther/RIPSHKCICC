New-home sales in the U.S. surged last month but 2010 was still the worst year on record for the battered homebuilding industry.

Sales increased by 17.5% in December, compared with the previous month, rising to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 329,000 new homes, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. 

That wasn't enough to turn around a notably bad year. For all of 2010, the government estimated that about 321,000 homes were sold—the lowest tally on records dating back to 1963—as joblessness and foreclosures continue to weigh on the market.

December's strength was driven by surging sales in the West, which rose 71.9%, and were likely inflated by a rush to take advantage of a homebuyer tax credit in California.

"New-home sales are bouncing around the bottom," said Ian Shepherdson, a High Frequency Economics Ltd. analyst. "Ultimately, we think a sustained acceleration in payrolls will be the key driver of stronger demand for new property, so we think the second half of this year will be a good deal better than the first."

While home sales ended the year on an encouraging note, total sales in 2010 were 14.2% lower than in 2009. Compared with December 2009, new home sales last month were 7.6% lower. 

Prices also firmed last month. The median sales price for a new home sold in December was $241,500, up 8.5% from the same month a year ago. A jump in sales of higher-priced homes in the West may have been behind the increase, which analysts don't expect to last.

In December, the number of new homes available for sale slid to 190,000, a supply that would take 6.9 months to deplete at the current sales rate. A six-month supply of new homes is considered healthy. The supply in November was 8.4 months.

In addition to the West, sales picked up in the Midwest, rising 3.2%, and the South, increasing 1.8%. Sales fell 5% in the Northeast.
