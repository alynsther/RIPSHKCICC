Coal producers led Chinese stocks higher on Friday amid optimism over prices, but Australian shares ended the year on a weak note, with  BHP Billiton weighed down by speculation it may launch a bid for Anadarko Petroleum.

China's Shanghai Composite Index rose 1.8% to 2,808.08, ending the year with a 14% loss, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 dropped 0.9% to 4745.24, down 2.6% for the year. 

Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index edged up 0.2% to 23035.45, leaving investors with a 5.3% gain for 2010. Singapore's Straits Times Index lost 0.7%, slipping to 3190.04 for a gain of 10% for the year. India's Sensitive Index rose 0.6% to 20509.09, rising 17% in 2010. 

Markets in Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines, South Korea, Malaysia and Thailand were shut for New Year's Eve.

Chinese coal producers posted solid gains after Shanxi Xishan Coal & Electricity Power said it will raise the price of some of its products from Saturday, which would increase its sales by around 1.3 billion yuan ($197 million). Shanxi Xishan shares jumped 6.1%, while Yanzhou Coal Mining gained 4.4%.

Overall activity was muted, however. "There is little desire for investors to trade in the last session of this year," said Li Bin, an analyst at Capital Securities.

In Sydney trading, BHP Billiton dropped 1.3% in the wake of a report in the U.K.'s Daily Mail that the mining giant may make a $90-a-share bid for Anadarko Petroleum Corp.

Financial shares and some other miners also drifted lower in thin trading, but RBS's head of domestic sales trading,  Justin Gallagher, said there was no theme to the selling. 

"The volumes are so atrocious, maybe there's a bit of rebalancing going on," he said.
