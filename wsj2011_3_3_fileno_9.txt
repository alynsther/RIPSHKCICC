DUBAIâ€”Egypt's stock exchange, shut since Jan. 27 due to political unrest, has delayed again the resumption of trading until it consults the country's new prime minister. 

"The bourse management has decided to suspend trading until a date is set after consulting the prime minister," the Egyptian Exchange said in a statement emailed for Zawya Dow Jones late Thursday. 

The market was set to open Sunday after a number of postponements intended to soften the fallout for investors from a wave of selling that is expected to result from the ouster of former President  Hosni Mubarak. 

The announcement came after Prime Minister  Ahmed Shafiq resigned Thursday and was succeeded by a U.S.-educated former transport minister,  Essam Sharaf. The change signaled a break from Mr. Mubarak's regime and met a major remaining demand of the protest movement that toppled him. 

Until the crisis broke in January, Egypt was considered one of the hottest emerging markets around, drawing foreign investment that helped push the benchmark EGX 30 Index 15% higher in 2010. The index dropped 16% in the two days before the market closed on Jan. 27, ending that day at 5,647. 

Concerned about another market slump, stock-exchange authorities have implemented a set of new rules. 

The exchange will suspend trading on all stocks for 30 minutes if the broader EGX 100, a price index more sensitive than the EGX 30 to small and midcap stocks, moves more than 5%. It cut trading hours on the exchange by an hour.
