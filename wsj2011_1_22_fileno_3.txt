WASHINGTONâ€”U.S. President Barack Obama hailed the creation of a White House jobs council as a group that will lead to a spur in U.S. competitiveness and job creation.

In his weekly radio address, Obama said the Jobs and Competitiveness Council would "generate good ideas about how we can spur hiring, educate our workers to compete in the 21st century, and attract the best jobs and businesses to America rather than seeing them spring up overseas."

He said he was confident in the leadership of General Electric Co. Chief Executive Jeffrey Immelt on the council. The president announced this week that Mr. Immelt would lead the panel.

Obama said a free-trade deal renegotiated with South Korea at the end of last year would protect 70,000 U.S. jobs. 

In their weekly address, Republicans focused on the party's effort to repeal the health-care law. Republican Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, a practicing doctor, said the bill would kill jobs and raise health care costs.

He said Republicans would seek to replace it with a measure that allows people to buy insurance across state lines, limits bogus medical law suits and restores patient choice.
