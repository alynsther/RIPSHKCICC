Investors pulled $4 billion out of municipal-bond funds in the week ended Wednesday, setting a new record, Thomson Reuters unit Lipper FMI said Thursday. 

The outflow is the largest one since Lipper began measuring muni fund flows in 1992, eclipsing the $3.1 billion outflow in mid-November that previously claimed that title. 

It comes on the heels of a $1.5 billion pullout in the week ended Jan. 12 and marks the 10th straight week of outflows, which total roughly $20.6 billion. 

The four-week moving average, a more meaningful number because of the longer time span it measures, was an outflow of $2.2 billion versus an outflow of $1.9 billion in the previous four-week period.

Assets in the institutional class fell $35.36 billion to $1.82 trillion. Taxable government funds slid $22.25 billion to $628.72 billion. Nongovernment funds had outflows of $11.48 billion to $1.069 trillion. Tax-exempt funds decreased $1.63 billion to $122.29 billion. 

Retail funds had net inflows of $280 million to $940.84 billion. Taxable government funds grew $1.25 billion to $167.08 billion, while nongovernment funds fell $600 million to $566.85 billion. Tax-exempt funds slid $360 million to $206.91 billion.
