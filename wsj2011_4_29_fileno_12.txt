NEW DELHI â€“ State-run Steel Authority of India Ltd. Friday posted a sharper-than-expected 28% fall in fourth-quarter net profit, hit by higher cost of imported coking coal.

Net profit for the January-March period fell to 15.07 billion rupees ($340 million) from 20.85 billion rupees a year earlier and missed the 16.98 billion rupees average of forecasts from six analysts in a Dow Jones Newswires poll. 

Its sales rose 1% to 131.37 billion rupees from 130.05 billion rupees. 

Rising cost of raw materials, such as iron ore and coking coal, has hurt margins of Indian steelmakers over the past few quarters. 

Global raw material prices have been rising over the past year, as strong pace of industrial activity in China and India and continued revival of demand in developed countries have increased sales of steel. 

The company is largely insulated from any rise in iron ore prices, since it has its own captive mines, but is vulnerable to price shocks in coking coal as it imports all of the commodity. 

Steel Authority's total cost in the fourth quarter rose 8% to 102.11 billion rupees. 

Steel Authority in the just-ended quarter produced 3.43 million metric tons of steel products, a 5% rise over the year-earlier period.

The company said it spent 112.80 billion rupees in the past fiscal year, up 6% year-on-year, toward expanding production capacity at its existing plants. 

The company said it expanded market borrowings in 2010-11 to fund its expansion program. As of March 31, it had 201.62 billion rupees of debt and cash reserves of 170 billion rupees. 

Chairman C.S. Verma told reporters the company plans to increase its hot metal production capacity to 19.5 million tons from 14 million tons. 

Steel Authority expects capital expenditure in the next financial year that begins April 1 at 143 billion rupees. 

Mr. Verma said the company is also planning to set up an equally owned joint venture with Japan's Kobe Steel in the next two months to produce 500,000 tons of iron ore nuggets in India. 

The two companies plan to jointly invest $350 million in the venture.
