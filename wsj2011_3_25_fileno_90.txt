 'How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying,' opens Sunday 

At the Al Hirschfeld Theatre, Daniel Radcliffe will open in his first-ever Broadway musical as corporate climber J. Pierrepont Finch. Mr. Radcliffe, whose final "Harry Potter" movie appears this summer, may be taking an even bigger risk than he did by appearing nude in "Equus," his critically praised 2008 Broadway play debut. Despite his recent intensive musical theater training, will audiences buy their familiar young wizard dancing on a conference table while singing about humanity?

 'Body of Proof,' ABC, premieres Tuesday 

Two decades after the end of "China Beach," the ABC drama set at an evacuation hospital during the Vietnam War, actress Dana Delany returns to medicine. This time she's Megan Hunt, a brilliant neurosurgeon who must quit practicing after a car accident in the new drama "Body of Proof." She responds by becoming a medical examiner and using her scalpel skills to solve murders. Originally scheduled to premiere last fall on Fridays, ABC held the series so it could get a better, Tuesday time slot.

 'Nurse Jackie,'  Showtime, Monday 

Jackie Peyton, the pill-popping nurse with a heart of gold, returns for a third season. This time the troubled staffers at All Saints' Hospital in New York finally confront Jackie about her drug addiction. The role of a morally challenged nurse may not have thrilled the medical community but critics raved and last year Edie Falco won an Emmy for her performance. Only time will tell whether the comedy can build the audience to give it the staying power of such Showtime stalwarts as "Weeds" or "Dexter."
