"Take it slow," said the tuxedoed bartender at the "21" Club, placing down a pale-orange concoction in a highball glass. "There are many ingredients."

Eight, in fact, in the "21" Triple Crown, a new drink created to commemorate the horse races. It will be available starting Saturday, when the bar puts a TV in the lounge for the Kentucky Derby. 

The cocktail includes bourbon, rum, cream sherry and a splash of peach schnapps. "It tastes like fruit punch," says Tara Wright, the "21" bartender who created it, "with an accent on the punch." 

While many modern-day bars try to evoke the atmosphere of Manhattan's bygone clubs, it's ironic that one of the last survivors of that era looks to do something new. 

But old-school drinkers should rest assured. The lounge's dark wood paneling, fireplace, the Frederic Remington horse paintings, the low lighting, and the men in suits and ties—despite a recent loosening of the dress code—still beckon another age. The '21' Club, 21 W. 52nd St., between Fifth and Sixth, is open Monday to Saturday; 212-582-7200.
