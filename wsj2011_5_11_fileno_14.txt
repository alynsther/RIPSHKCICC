BENGHAZI, Libya—Rebels in the embattled western Libyan city of Misrata celebrated Wednesday the taking of a key air base outside the contested city in what they hailed as a major victory in their months-long struggle against Col. Moammar Gadhafi's troops.

A Misrata-based spokesman for the rebels reached over an Internet telephone connection said anti-government fighters seized the strategic air base and air force academy south of the city. The compound served as one of the main staging grounds for artillery and rocket attacks against the city by pro-Gadhafi soldiers and has been repeatedly bombarded by coalition forces since March. 

The only rebel-held position in western Libya, Misrata is the country's third-largest city, about 125 miles (200 kilometers) southeast of Libya's capital, Tripoli.

The spokesman Mohammed Slim said rebels "liberated" the road leading to the sprawling air base and then entered it earlier on Wednesday.

In Tripoli, government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim denied the rebel claim, saying the airport remained under the control of Col. Gadhafi's forces.

By nightfall the rebels' hold on the base appeared to be in contention, with Mr. Slim saying that Misrata was coming under fresh attack by pro-Gadhafi forces positioned beyond the air base while another official in the rebel capital of Benghazi farther east saying that the fight over the air base was still far from over.

The official Saadoun al-Misrati, a native of Misrata, said rebels entered the air base earlier in the day and then retreated closer to their supply lines when they came under attack by regime forces.
