When these Yankees hit, they smash balls out of the park at an astounding rate. When they don't, they do, well, nothing.

Wednesday was another of those nothing nights, as the Yankees were shut out 4-0 by the Detroit Tigers and pitcher Max Scherzer, who went eight innings. It marked the sixth time in the last 10 games that they have scored three runs or less; Yankees have notched just three extra base hits in their last two games. Mark Teixeira had one of them, a double, on Tuesday night.

The Yankees got enough out of Freddy Garcia, above, to keep them in the game—four runs, 10 hits allowed and eight strikeouts in seven innings— had they only managed to hit, but with the Yankee bats in a deep freeze, getting only four hits, the gap seemed like 14-0.

If only the Mets could fast-forward to July. Then, they could begin dismantling this roster. Then, they could begin to chart a path to whatever their future will be under Sandy Alderson. Until then, the Mets can only wait and endure nights like Wednesday.

With Citi Field largely overtaken by San Francisco Giants fans, the Mets delivered a crowd-pleasing result, a 2-0 loss. Tim Lincecum was dominant, striking out 12 batters in seven innings.

For the Mets, Chris Capuano was decent, allowing just two runs in 6 1/3 innings. But Mets hitters finished just 1 for 9 with runners in scoring position.

After winning six games in a row in late April, the Mets have since lost five of six. At 12-18, they are on pace to lose 97 games. With Wednesday's loss, they fell 8 1/2 games behind the first-place Philadelphia Phillies.
