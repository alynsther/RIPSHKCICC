 QUOTED: "The massive borrowing and spending by the Treasury Department crowded out private investment by American businesses of all sizes." 

 -- House Speaker  John Boehner  May 9, 2011 

 REALITY: There is no evidence that private investment is being "crowded out" by government borrowing and spending.

If businesses were having trouble borrowing, they'd have to offer higher yields in order to attract investors. But the cost of capital is near a record low.

Large companies with the best credit ratings are paying just 2.7% interest on their long-term debt, down from 4.73% at the beginning of the recession in December 2007 and a peak of 6.95% at the height of the credit crunch in September 2008.

 EDITOR'S NOTE: Rex Nutting, MarketWatch's Washington-based international commentary editor, checks the facts behind financial and economic pronouncements of executives, pundits and politicians.

Small businesses say their biggest concern is not the cost of capital or the availability of credit, but weak demand for what they sell.

Not only is it very cheap for companies to borrow or raise the money they need to expand, they already have a record $1.9 trillion in liquid assets on their books.

The proof is in the results: Far from being crowded out, U.S. companies are now investing in new equipment at a record $1.14 trillion annual rate, up 25% from the low point in 2009.
