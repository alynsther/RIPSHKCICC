The Metropolitan Museum of Art will lease the Whitney Museum of American Art's Upper East Side building when the Whitney opens its new downtown facility in 2015, the museums said Wednesday.

The Met agreed to lease the Whitney's Breuer building for eight years, with the option to extend, and plans to use the space to showcase its modern and contemporary art holdings. 

The agreement comes one day after the Museum of Modern Art agreed to purchase the American Folk Art Museum's building. While that deal was negotiated swiftly, the Whitney and the Met had been in talks for at least a year.

 The potential for such an arrangement helped pave the way for the Whitney board's May 2010 approval of a $680 million plan to open a six-story, 195,000-square-foot building in the Meatpacking District. That project is set to break ground May 24.

Because of the terms of the $131 million gift by its chairman emeritus, cosmetics executive Leonard Lauder, the Whitney can't sell its uptown building to help finance the downtown space. Income from the lease of the building at Madison Avenue and 75th Street, however, will help the Whitney alleviate some of its financial obligations.

"Throughout our planning for the Whitney's new building downtown we have committed ourselves to finding a distinguished museum partner for the Breuer building in keeping with its iconic stature," Whitney director Adam Weinberg said in a statement. "The Met is ideal in so many ways."

The Met plans to use the Whitney's longtime home for exhibitions and educational programs, and the museums plan to collaborate on collection-sharing.

"With this new space, we can expand the story that the Met tells, exploring modern and contemporary art in a global context that reflects the breadth of our encyclopedic collections," Met director Thomas Campbell said in a statement.
