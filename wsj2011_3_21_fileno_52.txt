Even though Padma Lakshmi can already claim at least five professional titles, master event planner might be the next addition to her C.V.

When co-hosting the third annual Blossom Ball to benefit the Endometriosis Foundation of America, Ms. Lakshmi was in full and impressive command. She encouraged short and sweet speeches and offered what every great benefit should feature within the confines of the New York Public Library: wine bottles and models (Ms. Lakshmi's beau, Ted Forstmann, who owns IMG, is a big sponsor of the charity), random cameos (Joel Schumacher, anyone?), two personal outfit changes and gyrating Brazilian Carnival dancers.

The "Top Chef" host was also, obviously, involved with the evening's menu. "I'm sorry that the sweet mashed potatoes are a little spicy," she said of the accompanying side to the lemon-infused halibut. 

"That's why you've got to love Padma," said actress Susan Sarandon. "She takes every dish so seriously. But yes, proceed to the potatoes with caution." 

Ms. Sarandon was a chaiwoman of the evening, with Cindi Leive and Eileen Guggenheim, but it was charity co-founder Dr. Tamer Seckin who easily got the most love. Many women in the room seemed to be among the gynecologist's acolytes. 

"I obviously see a lot of my patients here," said Dr. Seckin. "But I never really talk about them. I leave that to Padma."

Ms. Lakshmi's friend, New York Giant Justin Tuck, confessed that he was a little disoriented by the evening's cause. "I don't know anything about gynecologists though I should since I have five sisters," he said. "I have a little more time to learn nowâ€”the NFL has been on lockdown and I'm unemployed."
