Anand Giridharadas's book is more modest than its grandiose subtitle suggests. "India Calling" is not a treatment of the country as a whole, and numerous facets of its ongoing renaissance go essentially unmentioned. Instead, this smart, evocative and sharply observed memoir concentrates on an Indian-American's years in India as a McKinsey consultant and newspaper correspondent, introducing us to an entertaining gallery of characters along the way.

It consists, broadly, of Indians on the make—mostly young, usually navigating (very gingerly) tradition and modernity. Among them is Ravindra, a young man whose ambition for self-improvement has led him from an impoverished rural life to a job traveling internationally as (of all things) the manager of the Indian national roller-skating team. Ravindra's is just another "bright lights, big city" story. But Mr. Giridharadas's narrative gusto makes the familiar fresh, as when he describes the oft- mentioned practice of young Indians' flirting via mobile phone as "pockets vibrating with textual innuendo."

Immersing us in quotidian detail, Mr. Giridharadas ducks larger issues. There's little on India's dysfunctional politics or its religious tension, and a portrait of a Maoist rebel resisting the "Citibankification" of his country sits oddly amid so many scenes of upward mobility. One might expect the Maoist to supply the book's most misguided pronouncements, but that prize goes to the man who complains that, with its malls and conveniences, "India is becoming America." By Mr. Giridharadas's evidence, the country has long since come into its own and is in no danger of becoming anything but itself. Even if it is still working out exactly what that might be.
