The earthquake in Japan Friday damaged undersea cables on and could affect connectivity of calls made between China and Japan, said a spokesman for the parent company of Chinese network operator  China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd. 

"Two or three" cables were damaged, said the spokesman for China United Network Communications Group Co., but he warned his information wasn't complete and he didn't know which specific cables were affected. 

Unicom Group has adjusted routers to redirect data along undamaged paths and the effect of the cable damage on its operations is limited, the spokesman said. 

Also, Chunghwa Telecom Co. reported "some damage" to an undersea cable that is partly owned by the Taiwanese fixed-line operator, but data transmission hasn't been interrupted. 

An official from Chunghwa Telecom, who asked not to be named, said the affected cable belongs to the Asia Pacific Cable Network 2, which is owned by a consortium of 14 telecom operators led by AT&T Inc.

The damaged part is near Kita on the eastern coast of Japan, the Chunghwa Telecom official said, without elaborating.
