This is a few weeks later than earlier guidance given by the companies, who previously said they expected the deal to close in the first quarter of this year. Cairn and Vedanta are awaiting approval for the deal from the Indian government.

Cairn said that its gross daily oil and gas production for 2010 was up 70% on the previous year, due to the startup of its major oil fields in Rajasthan, India.

Cairn produced at total of 130,952 barrels of oil equivalent a day in 2010 from fields it operates. The company's share of oil from this total was 63,359 barrels of oil equivalent a day, which it sold at an average price of $69.18 a barrel.

Cairn added that it continues to assess well results and seismic surveys for Greenland and will announce in May the locations of its next four wells offshore the largely unexplored country.
