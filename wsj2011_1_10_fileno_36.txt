Banks led European stocks' losses as worries about sovereign debt returned to the fore amid speculation that Portugal may be forced to take a bailout. 

The concerns resurfaced following reports over the weekend that France and Germany are urging Portugal to accept funds from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, despite the country's insistence that it doesn't need help. 

The Stoxx Europe 600 index closed down 0.9% at 278.48. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 index fell 0.5% to 5956.30, France's CAC-40 index ended down 1.6% at 3802.03, and Germany's DAX fell 1.3% to 6857.06. 

The Stoxx Europe 600 index for the banking sector ended down 1.9% as investors worried about the sector's exposure to sovereign debt. Basic resources were also under selling pressure, with the Stoxx Europe 600 index for the sector closing 1.1% lower amid declining base-metals prices.

"Instead of leaning back, the ECB is very much there supporting the periphery," said  Martin Van Vliet at ING.
