Second baseman Roberto Alomar, who was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame on Wednesday, spent a forgettable season-and-a-half with the Mets in 2002 and 2003, hitting .265 over 222 games. Still, the team released a statement congratulating Mr. Alomar "on baseball's most prestigious honor, his well-deserved election into the Hall of Fame."

Centerfielder Carlos Beltran, who joined the Mets in 2005, said, "He's my personal friend. No one played his position better."

It's a comeback season for the Knicks on the floor, and now, apparently, on television, as the team's ratings on MSG are up 39% from a year ago. The Knicks are rating a 1.50 on the season and just completed their highest-rated month since 2004-05, when Nielsen changed its methodology to people meters. 

The Knicks' Dec. 15th game against the Boston Celtics was their highest-rated game on MSG since opening night in 2001, scoring a 3.61.

After missing the last three games of the regular season with a right knee injury, Jets offensive tackle Damien Woody expects to play in Saturday's first-round playoff game against the Indianapolis Colts. Mr. Woody has participated in two practices this week and assessed his knee as "great." He underwent arthroscopic surgery on Dec. 15 to repair a partially torn ligament.

In off-the-field news (because there's always off-the-field news with the Jets), a team spokesman confirmed that the Jets are appealing the $100,000 fine that the NFL levied against the franchise because of the tripping incident involving strength and conditioning coach Sal Alosi.
