MUMBAI â€“Indian shares fell for the seventh straight session Tuesday to close at a near six-week low, as a sharper-than-expected rise in key rates by the Reserve Bank of India, coupled with a gloomy economic growth outlook, sparked a broad sell-off. 

The Bombay Stock Exchange's Sensitive Index fell 463.33 points, or 2.4%, to close at 18,534.69. The benchmark has lost 5.4% over the past seven sessions and had last ended below Tuesday's close on March 24. 

Trading volume on the BSE rose to 31.04 billion rupees ($700 million) from Monday's 24.10 billion rupees. Decliners heavily outnumbered gainers 2,102 to 711, while 112 stocks were unchanged. 

On the National Stock Exchange, the 50-stock S&P CNX Nifty fell 136.05 points, or 2.4%, to end at 5,565.25. 

India's central bank raised its lending rate by 0.5 percentage point Tuesday and said reining in inflation is the top priority, even if there are some short-term costs by way of lower growth. 

Only five of 15 economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires had predicted the 50 basis-point hike, with the rest expecting a 0.25-percentage point increase. 

The RBI also said it expects the economy to expand around 8% in the current fiscal year, lower than the 8.6% the economy is estimated to have grown last fiscal year. 

"Apart from the rate hike, the RBI has said [economic] growth might slow down due to monetary tightening and that it is okay with it. If growth slows, companies' earnings would obviously be impacted," said  Vikas Khemani, head of institutional equities at Edelweiss Capital. 

The near-term outlook for Indian shares, especially rate-sensitive stocks, looks bleak and investors will be closely watching foreign fund flows for cues, he added. 

All but one of the 30 Sensex constituents ended lower with banking, auto and real estate falling the most. 

Concerns about the impact of rising interest rates on banks' interest margins were amplified after the RBI raised the annual interest banks pay on savings deposits to 4.0% from 3.5%. 

"The policy is clearly a negative for banks on a number of counts and the increase in the savings bank rate will impact interest margins of all banks," said Angel Broking Vice President  Vaibhav Agrawal. 

State Bank of India fell 4.0% to 2,583.10 rupees and ICICI Bank shed 2.8% to 1,067.90 rupees. 

In autos, losses were led by  Tata Motors, which fell 5.3% to 1,163.45 rupees while Bajaj Auto slipped 5.0% to 1,366.95 rupees. 

DLF led the 2.9% fall in the realty index, ending 2.6% lower at 220.80 rupees. 

Reliance Industries, India's largest company by market capitalization, dipped 2.2% to 943.95 rupees. 

In other Sensex losers, Jaiprakash Associates fell 8.1% to 85.05 rupees as investors worried that the diversified conglomerate would have to shell out more cash as interest payments for its infrastructure projects following the hike in policy rates. 

The sole Sensex gainer was engineering company Bharat Heavy Electricals, which wrapped up 0.2% higher at 2,014.60 rupees.
