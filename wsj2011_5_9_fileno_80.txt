When Memphis native Justin Timberlake and partners opened rib joint Southern Hospitality on the Upper East Side a few years ago, they brought a taste of Tennessee to the Big Apple.

Now, the gentlemen have branched out a little farther south, with a much larger outpost in Hell's Kitchen. 

Justin Timberlake is one of the creators behind Southern Hospitality, a Memphis-style BBQ joint with two locations in Manhattan.

Perhaps because of the owners, you might spot some boldface names in the crowd (Carmelo Anthony, Lala Vasquez and the Jonas Brothers were recent guests). Like everyone else, they're there to pig out. 

The menu is much of the same you'll see uptown, but in a somewhat unusual twist, the owners have brought on Gary Vaynerchuk to create a wine list to match the meals. (There are 50 varieties of bourbon, too.)

"Firestarters," or appetizers, run $6.95 to $11.95 and include Southern fried chicken livers, BBQ nachos and crawfish-and-cheddar hush puppies. Next, make a beeline for the barbecueâ€”wet, dry or on a sandwich. 

There are salads, too, but why would you want one? For $3.95 or $5.95, have your 'cue with a side of baked beans, a hunk of cornbread with honey butter or some rosemary grits. 

Hungry men (and ladies) can add fried shrimp or chicken to the mix, or just go for a platter. Those who finish the Over the Top Combo (wet and dry Memphis spareribs, baby-back ribs, half a barbecue chicken with four sides and cornbread; $49.95) will have their photos added to the wall of fame. 

 Southern Hospitality, 645 Ninth Ave. at 45th Street, is open noon to 11 p.m. Monday to Thursday, noon to midnight Friday and similar hours weekends; 212-265-1000.
