After four consecutive gains, the National Federation of Independent Business index of small-business optimism fell back in December.

The NFIB’s index slipped 0.6 point to 92.6 last month.

“Apparently, the ‘management change’ in Washington and marginally better retail-sales numbers weren’t enough to pump up spirits at the New Year celebrations,” the NFIB said.

A big drag came from the subindex of expected business conditions in six months. It fell seven percentage points to 9%. In addition, the subindex on earnings trends fell four points to -34%.

Even so, small-business owners expect an improvement in demand, with the expected sales index up two percentage points to 8%.

Hiring also made gains. The December employment subindex increased two points to 6%. For those firms that are hiring, the subindex covering job openings that are hard to fill rose four points to 13%.

“The reduction in the payroll tax will add some impetus to hiring as most of that addition to take-home pay will be spent,” the report said.

Inflation pressures from small businesses remain low. Seasonally adjusted, the net percentage of owners raising prices stood at -5% in December, a one-point drop from November.

Even so, the report said the “trend is clearly supportive of higher prices in future months.” Plans to raise prices rose two points to a seasonally adjusted net reading of 15% of owners, the highest rate in more than two years.
