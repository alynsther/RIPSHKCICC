NEW DELHI -- India expects an amicable solution to the Iran oil payments issue during a scheduled visit of officials to Tehran later this week, Oil Secretary S. Sundareshan said Monday.

"We would require payments to be channelised through alternative banks which will be suggested by National Iranian Oil Company," Mr. Sundareshan told reporters. "We have on table some banks which have been suggested. We will probably work through them."

A delegation comprising officials from the finance and oil ministries and the Reserve Bank of India will be visiting Tehran in the later part of the week, he said.

Iran and India have been trying to find an alternative payment mechanism after the RBI stopped Iran-related payments through the Asian Clearing Union route.
