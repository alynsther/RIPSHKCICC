LAKELAND, Fla.â€”For two-and-a-half hours, Angel Pagan fidgeted in his seat on the Mets' bus, trying to find a comfortable position. It didn't happen.

As a result, the center fielder arrived here with a stiff lower back. He left Tuesday's 7-4 exhibition victory over the Detroit Tigers after the first inning.

"It's nothing bad," he said. "We're just being cautious. It's only 10 days before the season starts, so why would you want to get worse?"

The injury appears to be relatively minor. Pagan will skip the trip to Jupiter for Wednesday's game against the St. Louis Cardinals, though he said he will work out at the Mets' complex in Port St. Lucie. 

But the fact that his back felt tight on the bus, with no prior problems, underscores the team's travel woes.

A Wall Street Journal analysis earlier this month found that the Mets will travel more miles by bus (2,752) this spring than any team in baseball. With only nine Grapefruit League games left, most Mets regulars, including David Wright, Jose Reyes and Jason Bay, made the trip to Joker Marchant Stadium. Only Pagan seemed affected by it.

"Those buses are not really comfortable, but it is what it is," Pagan said. "You have to ride it and come over here and play a ballgame."

With right fielder Carlos Beltran still recovering from knee injuries, the health of Pagan is especially important.

 Had this been a regular-season game, Pagan said he easily could have kept playing. But after one inning in the field, with his back still a little stiff, he decided to call it a day.

"When you have a two-and-a- half-hour bus ride, those things happen," Mets manager Terry Collins said. "That was one of the reasons, even early in camp, I didn't want them wearing shorts. I wanted them wearing something where they can stay somewhat warm on those buses."
