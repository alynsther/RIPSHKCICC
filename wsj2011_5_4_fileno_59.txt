LONDON—Consumer prices in developed economies rose in March at the fastest pace since October 2008, driven by energy and food inflation. 

But with the economic recovery still fragile in many of those economies, the response of central banks to the pickup in inflation is likely to vary. The European Central Bank raised its key interest rate last month, but the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of England aren't expected to match that move for many months. 

Data released by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development on Tuesday show consumer prices in its 34 member countries rose by 2.7% in the 12 months to March, having risen by 2.4% in the year to February. 

Rising energy and food prices are the main source of inflation. In the 12 months to March, food prices rose 3.2%, having risen by 3.1% in the year to February. Energy prices rose by 12.4%, having risen by 10.2% in the period to February. 

There are signs that prices of other goods and services are rising at a more rapid rate as the global economy recovers. In the OECD area, the core rate of inflation—which excludes volatile items such as energy and food—rose to 1.4% in March from 1.3% in February.
