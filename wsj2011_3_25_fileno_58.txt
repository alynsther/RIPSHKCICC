It's well known that Mark Teixeira's biggest nemesis is the calendar. His chronically poor Aprils make him one of baseball's slowest starters. But a closer examination of his numbers suggests a new theory as to what ails the first baseman in the early part of season: He can't hit when it's cold outside.

In 121 career games when the temperature is below 60 degrees, Teixeira has a .211 average and a sub-par .741 on-base plus slugging percentage (OPS). This includes 12 cold-weather postseason games when he's hit .170 with .541 OPS. In all other games, Teixeira hits .292 with a .926 OPS.

Cold weather generally hurts everyone's offensive productivity. According to Yale physicist Robert Adair, fly balls travel about four feet less for every 10-degree drop in temperature. But Teixeira's struggles far exceed typical cold-weather declines.

Saying that Teixeira's just a slow starter is contradicted by his very hot spring training performances (.373/1.118 OPS for the Yankees, including .302/.993 this year). Also consider his best April ever back in 2006 for the Texas Rangers (.293/.886). That year, the Rangers played 22 of his 25 April games in more temperate weather in Texas and on the West Coast. This year, the schedule maker gives Teixeira little reprieve. The Yankees have 18 April home games, 13 of which are at night. They also travel to Boston and Baltimore. The only respite is a two-game trip to Toronto, which becomes an indoor park when the weather is cold. 

But perhaps the Blue Jays will opt to open the roof and play those games alfresco in hopes of freezing Teixeira's bat.
