The city will retain exclusive use of the name Tavern on the Green for restaurant services in the city, but use of the name outside of the tri-state region can now be sold, according to a settlement reached Thursday in federal bankruptcy court.

The settlement is part of the bankruptcy-court proceedings with the Chapter 7 Trustee for Tavern on the Green Ltd. Partnership LP and LeRoy Adventures Inc. 

The agreement will allow a buyer to use the iconic Tavern name and logo for restaurants outside of the tri-state area, which includes a portion of Pennsylvania, according to Streambank, the advisory firm that will market and sell the rights to the name.

Though the buyer can use the trademark, it must have distinguishing features and specify that the operation is not related to Tavern in New York City.

The buyer can also use the name for products such as packaged foods and home furnishing outside of the metro area, which includes the five boroughs and surrounding counties.

"We are pleased that this agreement resolves the litigation while ensuring that the City will be able to continue using the iconic TOG trademark, as it has since 1937," said  Howard Friedman, a city attorney, in an emailed statement.

The famed Central Park restaurant closed at the end of 2009 after the former operators filed for bankruptcy. 

Whether or not the building will ever reopen as a restaurant again remains unclear. Negotiations with  Dean J. Poll, who won a license to operate Tavern in 2009, and the union representing the restaurant's former workers, broke down last year. The restaurant has since been turned into a visitor center and an outdoor food court with food trucks. The mayor has indicated it may never be transformed into a restaurant like Tavern again.
