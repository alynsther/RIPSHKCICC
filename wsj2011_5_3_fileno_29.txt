AUCKLAND, New Zealand—A tornado twisted through the North Shore of New Zealand's largest city on Tuesday, killing and injuring shoppers at Westfield Albany mall and adding to woes in the Pacific Island nation that is still struggling to recover from a devastating earthquake earlier this year.

Windows were smashed and part of the shopping complex roof was damaged after the tornado hit Auckland, with local radio reporting that two people had been killed in the freak storm that left a number of cars badly wrecked outside the mall.

Amy Watson, manager at a women's clothing store, said she'd been outside just prior to the tornado, which sent a tall spiraling cloud cutting across part of the city, and saw the guttering rip off as the twister struck around at around 3pm local time. 

"I ran inside and heard a huge bang and then there was stuff flying," said Ms. Watson, adding that one customer was thrown against a glass window.

"We have had only minor cosmetic damage to our roof, a few tiles have come off and that sort of thing," said a spokeswoman for Westfield, the largest shopping mall owner. "We haven't been able to get in there to assess the damage fully yet. Everyone was evacuated safely."

New Zealand's South Island is still recovering from an earthquake that destroyed large parts of its second-largest city Christchurch in February and left at least 160 people dead. The February quake was the second to hit the region in six months and the rebuild is expected to cost the already cash-strapped government some NZ$8.5 billion. (US$6.8 billion).
