 Gourmet Ice Cream for  Snobs  and Slobs  

It's easy to be skeptical of ice creamery Cowabunga's foodie cred; the Forked River, N.J.-based company specializes in so-called "designer" ice cream and probiotic frozen yogurt with flavor bases seemingly named for the Real Housewives set (e.g. Hampton's Lux Vanilla, Madison Avenue Chocolate). 

But they pass the taste test. Try a spoonful of the graham-cracker-crust-packed NY Cheesecake or the equal parts crunchy, fudgy and chunky Death By Chocolate. $7 a pint (minimum order of $50), cowabungaicecream.com 

 A Preseason Watermelon Fix 

What's a Southern gal doing in a town like Portland, Ore.? Pickling watermelon rinds, naturally. South Carolina native Tricia Butler has brought a little bit of home to the Pacific Northwest with her catering business Sassafras and its canned-goods offshoot. 

In addition to those tart, star-anise-accented pickle rinds (try them in place of cornichons), don't miss turmeric-tinged sunchoke relish (put it on your next frank). From $7, sassafrascatering.com 

 Get Buzzed on . . . Quinoa? 

Five months ago, Bar Keeper, a vintage barware shop in Silver Lake, Calif. got its retail liquor license. The owner, Joe Keeper, fills his shelves with small-batch, unknown or hard-to-find imbibables, including the Fair line of fair-trade versions of spirits. 

The quinoa-derived vodka and two liqueurs, the grenadine-like Goji and the Mexican-bean-based Café, are all well-suited to cocktail mixing. Made from a combination of Arabica beans, medium roasted and macerated into spirit, plus organic sugar cane, the latter is also worth sipping solo.From $20 for 375 ml, fairtradespirits.com
