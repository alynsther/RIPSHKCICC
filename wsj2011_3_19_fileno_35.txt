DUNEDIN, Fla.—Alex Rodriguez has long been one of baseball's best hitters, but his performance this spring is enough to make someone wonder: Was there something in the popcorn Cameron Diaz was feeding him during the Super Bowl?

 Rodriguez has at least one hit in each of the 11 games he's played for the Yankees this spring, and he's batting .406 with four doubles and four home runs.

 "You do take notice of the way he's swung the bat in spring training," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. "And you get a little smile."

Mets outfielder Carlos Beltran received a cortisone shot on his left knee Friday in an attempt to eliminate lingering inflammation in the joint. General manager Sandy Alderson said the team still expects Beltran to be ready for Opening Day. 

"But at the same time," he said, "this is another bump in the road, so we'll see how it goes over the next week." 

Beltran, who has spent much of the last year rehabbing from right knee surgery, injured the left knee earlier this spring. He has played in only one Grapefruit League game.
