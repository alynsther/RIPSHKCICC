DUNEDIN, Fla.â€”Over his last three seasons with the Mets, Pedro Feliciano was as reliable as a sunrise. He pitched in a total of 266 games, leading the National League in appearances each year. It has seemed a bit strange, then, that in this, his first spring training with the Yankees, he hasn't pitched since March 9.

On Friday, Yankees manager Joe Girardi explained why. Feliciano, Girardi said, has a sore arm. In describing the soreness, Girardi pointed to the back of his own left arm, meaning that the pain was in Feliciano's triceps area. It was another in a growing number of aches, pains and strains for the Yankees' bullpen.

"He's just getting a little extra rest here," Girardi said. "Guys go through this dead arm in spring training."

Both Feliciano and right-hander Joba Chamberlain, who has a strained oblique muscle, are scheduled to throw bullpen sessions on Saturday. Boone Logan, the Yankees' other left-handed reliever, pitched Thursday night against Tampa Bay, then showed up Friday morning with back spasms, which according to Girardi could prevent him from throwing again for 4-5 days.

With the Yankees' first regular-season game now less than two weeks away, Girardi acknowledged that should these injuries linger, they could affect which relievers remain on the roster when spring training ends.

"It's possible that Joba goes out and throws his bullpen [and] he doesn't feel good. Or Feliciano throws his bullpen and doesn't feel good," Girardi said. "But...I don't think any of us really know until they go out and compete."
