When Dave Eichelberger played in his first Sony Open, his partner was 1938 Masters winner Henry Picard and pineapples were used as tee markers. The 67-year-old Eichelberger, who played on the PGA Tour from 1968 to '91, qualified for this week's Sony Open in Oahu, Hawaii—by shooting his age to win a qualifier last September. If he makes the cut, he'll become the oldest player to do so on Tour. Working in his favor: he's a member of Waialae, where the event is being held.

On Saturday, three Duke undergrads will be calling the Blue Devils' game against Virginia in Mandarin.
