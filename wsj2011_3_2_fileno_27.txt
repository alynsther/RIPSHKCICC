U.S. stocks finished a touch higher after the previous session's sharp selloff, even as crude oil rose above $100 a barrel and gold rose to a new record.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 8.78 points, or 0.07%, to 12066.80 after a day of choppy trading. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index increased 2.11 points, or 0.16%, to 1308.44, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 10.66 points, or 0.39%, to 2748.07.

The market moves came as crude oil rose $2.60, or 2.6%, to $102.23 a barrel for April delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest settlement since Sept. 26, 2008. Brent crude oil, traded in London, rose to $116.35 a barrel to notch a 2Â½-year high.

The rise in oil prices has been underpinned by fears that the unrest in the Mideast and North Africa will disrupt oil supplies from the region. The blue-chip Dow on Tuesday slumped 1.4% on worries that sustained increases in oil prices may represent a threat to economic growth.

The Saudi Arabia stock index, already down sharply in recent days, fell 3.9% Wednesday to bring its weekly decline to 15%.

"Any mention of Saudi Arabia brings instant fear and sends the market down," said  Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Banyan Partners. "People are wondering if yesterday's selloff was such an appropriate move to be making. [These high oil prices] are still so new that it's hard to completely factor in."

Even so, concerns lingered that the Mideast and North African turmoil still has to run its course.

"The market had an enormous run-up, and there was probably some unbridled optimism," said  Mitchell Eichen, financial adviser and wealth strategist at the MDE Group in Morristown, N.J. "The market is priced to perfection, and anything that wasn't perfection was going to disrupt that, whether it's oil or Congress fighting over the debt ceiling ... The slightest shift can knock the market off-balance."

The sole economic data point showed U.S. private-sector employment growing by 217,000 last month, better than consensus expectations of 170,000 new jobs. The strong numbers come ahead of Friday's closely watched nonfarm-payrolls report. Separately, the Federal Reserve said in its periodic "beige book" report that nationwide economic activity "continued to expand at a modest to moderate pace."
