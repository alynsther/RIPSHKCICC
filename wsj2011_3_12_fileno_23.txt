Matt Moulson, Michael Grabner and Jack Hillen scored within six minutes spanning the second and third periods to help the Islanders rally for a victory over the Boston Bruins Friday night in Uniondale.

P.A. Parenteau added an empty-net goal, and Al Montoya made 26 saves for the Islanders, who have won 12 of 17 games following the All-Star break. 

Nathan Horton and Zdeno Chara scored for the Bruins. Chara was booed constantly for his rough play, which recently sent a Montreal player to the hospital.
