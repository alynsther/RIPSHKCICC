NEW DELHI -- Bharti Airtel Ltd will not extend its bid to buy out the Indian government's 30% stake in Bharti Hexacom Ltd, the company said. 

The Indian government holds its stake in the telephony and related services provider through Telecommunications Consultants of India Ltd, or TCIL, while Bharti Airtel Ltd owns the remaining 70% stake. 

TCIL earlier in 2010 invited expressions of interest for the sale of its stake in Bharti Hexacom through an open bidding process. 

"Due to procedural issues the process has not culminated into finality," the company said in an e-mail response. "Bharti Airtel, therefore, has decided not to extend the bank guarantee and the offer to buy 30% equity."

Bharti Airtel and Punj Lloyd Ltd. had put in bids to buy the stake in Bharti Hexacom, which operates in the western state of Rajasthan and northeastern states. 

The advisors to the government's disinvestment had requested Bharti Airtel to extend the validity of the offer, but the company said it declined, and has requested the return of its bank guarantee. 

TCIL has hired consulting firm Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India Pvt. Ltd as an adviser for the stake-sale process. 

Executives at  Punj Lloyd and TCIL couldn't immediately be reached for comments.
