A Gallup poll released last week suggests that the electorate is leaning in a more conservative and Republican direction -- results which augur well for the GOP in next year's presidential election.

The poll finds "a marked decline in the number of solidly Democratic states from 2008 (30) to 2010 (14)." And not one state has moved in a more Democratic direction since 2008.

In the past four years, 12 states (Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, Maine, Missouri, Nevada, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Virginia and Wisconsin) that were labeled "solidly or leaning Democratic" have now shifted into the "competitive" category. And one state, New Hampshire, which was solidly Democratic in 2008, is now considered a "leaning Republican" state. So much for the permanent political realignment the Democrats were hoping for two years ago.

Every state recorded a drop in Democratic affiliation since 2008. The biggest declines were in Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Maine and Hawaii; the smallest were in North Dakota and Mississippi. "After several years of increasing Democratic affiliation beginning in late 2005, the current political situation is similar to what it was in the mid-2000s, when the parties were more or less even," says Gallup.

These are undoubtedly the political repercussions of a liberal policy agenda by the Obama administration on fiscal and economic issues. Voters appear to be disassociating themselves from a national Democratic party that gave us ObamaCare and a $1.6 trillion deficit. The midterm election blowout for the Republicans obviously reflected that voter unease, but it still doesn't put the GOP in any kind of a commanding position going into 2012. President Obama remains personally popular and will be difficult to beat. The good news for Republicans is that the electoral map looks much less ominous today than it did four years ago.
