WASHINGTONâ€”A top Securities and Exchange Commission official said the regulator would move ahead as soon as this summer with a proposal to cap the marketing fees charged to mutual-fund investors.

The SEC will move with "full force" on the proposal limiting the fees following the one-year anniversary of the Dodd-Frank financial law in July, SEC Commissioner  Elisse Walter said at a mutual-fund industry conference.

The proposal, which won the support of all five SEC commissioners when it was issued last July, has elicited more than 2,000 comment letters from industry officials and the public. A second vote by the commission is required to make it final.

Investors who buy mutual-fund shares often have a choice to pay a large front-end sales charge or pay the sales charge little by little over time. Such "12b-1 fees" help compensate third parties that help market the funds and other intermediaries.

The SEC is concerned that the fees may not be transparent to some investors who choose to pay the sales charge over time.

"The fees need to be set in a manner that's fair," Ms. Walter told reporters on the sidelines of the conference. She said she is bothered that "it's very difficult for investors to understand what they're paying and when."

Under the proposal, the term "12b-1 fees" would be phased out. Continual sales charges would be capped so they didn't exceed the maximum charge for those who choose to pay the sales charge upfront. The commission may make changes to the proposal before it is adopted.

Ms. Walter said it was important to eliminate the 12b-1 name "because it immediately sounds to an investor like something I don't understand."
