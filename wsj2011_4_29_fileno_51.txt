Every year around this time, as the first rounds of the NBA and NHL playoffs wind down, sports fans wage a fierce debate: Which is better in the postseason—rest or momentum? It turns out the answer may be neither.

Since the NBA extended the conference quarterfinals to seven games in 2003, no team that swept its first opponent went on to win the championship. Among teams that played seven games in the opening round, only one went all the way—the Boston Celtics in 2008. In the NHL during that span, no team that won its first series in four or seven games ended up winning the Stanley Cup. That's 19 first-round sweeps and 26 seven-game series altogether between the two sports, with only one title and eight finals appearances to speak of.

Since 2003, the eventual NBA and NHL champion played an average of 5.6 games in the first round. Of the 15 title-winners in both leagues, seven won their opening-round series in five games, seven won in six games and one won in seven. 

Looking further back—when the first round of the NBA playoffs lasted five games instead of seven—it seems teams have been better off winning quickly than playing to the brink of elimination. Since 1985, there have been 93 sweeps in the two sports, with 20 of those teams winning the championship (21.5%). Meanwhile, only seven of the 111 teams that won their first-round series in the maximum number of games won their respective titles (6.3%).
