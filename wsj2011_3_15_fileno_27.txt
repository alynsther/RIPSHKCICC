SEOULâ€”North Korea notified South Korea Tuesday that it would accept the return of 27 North Koreans who were on a boat that drifted to a South Korean island in early February.

The announcement came nearly two weeks after Pyongyang refused to take the 27, in protest of a decision by four others from the same boat to defect to the South. 

North Korea said it wanted the 27 to return by boat to the North, South Korean officials said. The South wanted the people to transfer across the land border crossing that is usually used in such incidents. It wasn't clear how or when officials from the two sides would resolve the matter and schedule the return.

The 31 North Koreans arrived on South Korea's Yeonpyeong Island on the night of Feb. 4. South Korean officials said the North Koreans initially explained they drifted to the South unintentionally. But authorities held the group for several weeks of questioning, as they routinely do when North Koreans arrive in the South. On March 3, the day before they were to return home, four asked to stay in the South.

On March 4, North Korea accused the South of holding the four hostage and refused to accept the other 27. South Korea said the four chose to remain in South Korea independently and offered to let North Korean Red Cross officials enter the South to verify the decision, but Seoul refused North Korea's request to bring the four to the inter-Korean border.

Last week, North Korean state media published the names of the four defectors, as well as letters it said came from their relatives, which carried protests similarly worded to the government statements. Human-rights activists criticized those statements as intimidation, noting that North Korean defectors fear for the safety of the families they have left behind, who are often punished by the North's authoritarian regime.
