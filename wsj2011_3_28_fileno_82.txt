JUPITER, Fla.—In the grand scheme of things, it doesn't much matter which pitcher gets the last spot in the Mets' bullpen. But in the last days of spring training, this is what passes for drama.

Blaine Boyer pitched well again Sunday, allowing only a single in the sixth inning of a 3-1 exhibition loss to the St. Louis Cardinals. Jason Isringhausen pitched a perfect seventh inning. In all likelihood, only one will make the team.

"We're going to have to make some tough choices," Mets general manager Sandy Alderson said. "It could go to the last day.''

Barring a last-minute change in organizational thinking, six relievers are almost certain to make the team: Francisco Rodriguez, Bobby Parnell, Tim Byrdak, D.J. Carrasco, Pedro Beato and Taylor Buchholz. That leaves only one spot for Isringhausen or Boyer, assuming the Mets start the season with 12 pitchers.

The decision is complicated by the fact that the Mets cannot simply stash one of the two in the minors. Boyer has a clause in his contract that allows him to become a free agent if he does not make the team. Isringhausen said he would rather retire than accept a minor-league assignment.

The Mets were considering Isringhausen for the eighth-inning job. But his recent elbow soreness, though minor, reminded them of his health risk. Isringhausen is 38, hasn't pitched in the majors since 2009 and has undergone three reconstructive elbow surgeries.

As a former All-Star, his stature is far greater than that of Boyer. But if the Mets take Isringhausen and Boyer signs with another club, and Isringhausen gets injured, they'll end up with neither pitcher.

"There's always going to be questions about my health," Isringhausen said. "That's just always going to be there.…If my arm is healthy, I'm going to get people out. I know that."
