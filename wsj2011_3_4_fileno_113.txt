England suffered one of the most ignominious defeats in cricket history, a three-wicket loss to Ireland in Bagalore, India, Wednesday, raising the prospect of a humbling first-round exit at the ICC Cricket World Cup.

For sheer shock value, this was arguably the greatest upset ever in this tournament. England is a three-time World Cup finalist after all, the country that invented cricket. Until Wednesday's game, Ireland's cricket history was only slightly richer than America's. 

But the English repeatedly squandered winning positions—some people backed England in-play at 1/100 on Betdaq—before some lusty hitting from Kevin O'Brien, who clubbed 113 runs off 63 balls, secured Ireland's victory.

The English have struggled in the field in each of their three games so far, conceding 959 runs in three matches—two of which came against nations that are deemed not good enough to play Test cricket.

Against South Africa, which has easily beaten West Indies and the Netherlands, England can expect more trouble: South African batters Hashim Amla and AB de Villiers have both posted big scores and lead the betting in the top South African run-scorer market at 3/1 and 4/1 respectively for this game.

Given England's travails, backing South Africa at 3/5 with Bwin and buying South Africa's total runs at 283 with Sporting Index both look attractive. For England, Andrew Strauss is one of the few players to have emerged with any credit so far. He has scored almost 100 runs more than any of his teammates and is favorite to be his side's top batsman at 3/1.
