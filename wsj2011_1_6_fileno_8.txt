KARACHI -- Pakistan has banned the export of onion to India through land, but has kept open the sea route for shipments, a senior trade ministry official said Thursday.

The ban follows complaints that exports to bridge a shortage in India has caused a sharp rise in the vegetable's prices in Pakistan.

"We are monitoring onion shipments. Huge orders were booked [for exports], inflating local prices," said the official, who didn't want to be identified.

Onion prices have jumped to 80 Pakistan rupees per kilogram from 45 Pakistan rupees in a month. Pakistan is estimated to have exported 50,000-60,000 metric tons of onion to India.
