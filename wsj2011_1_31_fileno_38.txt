DUBAI—Moody's Investors Service Inc. on Monday downgraded Egypt's government bond ratings to Ba2 from Ba1 and changed its outlook to negative from stable, citing political risk.

The ratings agency warned that the Egyptian administration's policy response to recent unrest could undermine the Arab republic's already weak public finances. 

Moody's also cut Egypt's ceiling for foreign-currency bonds to Baa3 from Baa2 and the ceiling for foreign-currency bank deposits to Ba3 from Ba2. 

"Moody's decision to downgrade Egypt's government bond ratings is driven by increased event risk," Moody's said in an emailed statement. "This has resulted from escalating political tensions in the country following the recent uprising in Tunisia, with large-scale antigovernment protests taking place." 

Moody's warned that "rising inflationary pressures" would further complicate Egypt's "fiscal policy by threatening to increase the high level of budgetary expenditure on wages and subsidies." 

Moody's is the first of the three major credit ratings agencies to downgrade Egypt since the protests kicked off, leaving its rating one notch below the other two agencies. Fitch Ratings and Standard and Poor's Corp. have BB+ ratings on the North African country. 

However, Fitch Ratings lowered the outlook on its rating to negative Friday, saying a downgrade could be imminent if the political unrest escalates. 

In a report last Thursday, S&P said economic risks and fiscal pressures for the region have been heightened in Egypt, Algeria, Jordan, and "to a lesser degree, Morocco," because of the revolt in Tunisia in mid-January.
