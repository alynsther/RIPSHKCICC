Lawrence Taylor avoided jail time Tuesday, but the all-time New York Giants great won't be able to avoid registering as a sex offender. The 52-year-old Hall of Fame linebacker was sentenced to six years probation in a Rockland County Court after pleading guilty in January to sexual misconduct. Taylor admitted at the time to paying a then 16-year-old for sex last May. A hearing will be held April 12 to determine what level Taylor will be assigned in the sex offender registry.

A misunderstanding caused former Mets second baseman Luis Castillo to show up late for his first day as a Philadelphia Phillie, according to a person with knowledge of the situation. 

After signing Castillo, whom the Mets had released last week, to a minor-league contract Monday, the Phillies had expected him to arrive at their spring-training complex in Clearwater by 7 a.m. Tuesday. But Castillo, the person said, thought he could arrive anytime, so he didn't report until Tuesday afternoon.
