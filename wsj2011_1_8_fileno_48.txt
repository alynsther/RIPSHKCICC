Just in time for detox season, we put several juicers to the test with apples, carrots, watermelons and even sweet potatoes. In addition to style and durability, we gave points to machines with mouths large enough to fit whole apples and that produced dry pulp (a sign of juicing efficiency).

 Breville Juice Fountain Plus 

$150 // breville.com 

 Plus: Cleanup in general was easy-peasy. We had no trouble lifting out the blade, which stuck on some of the other winners. This juicer was also among the quieter machines we tested.

 Minus: While it was faultless when it came to harder fruits and veggies, we sometimes had to run the watermelon pulp through twice to maximize the juice output.

 Oklife Juice Extractor 

$170 // oklifestore.com 

 PLUS: Refuse just slides off the mesh filter, which often allowed us to skip the pesky scrubbing step.

 MINUS: While we liked the speedcontrolling knob, which can be jacked up to tackle more stubborn substances, we didn't entirely see the point of the LCD screen

 De Longhi Juice Extractor 

$200 // shopdelonghi.com 

 PLUS: This innovative, and extremely attractive, juicer collects pulp within the base of the machine, rather than in an attached receptacle—a vertical arrangement that not only looks nice, but also saves precious counter space. 

 MINUS: Despite the suction on its bottom, it occasionally crept a few inches across the counter and required a steady hand to keep it in place.

 Hamilton Beach Big Mouth Juice Extractor 

$70 // hamiltonbeach.com 

 PLUS: The Big Mouth is deceptively powerful for its size and weight: It can gobble up whole apples while still squeezing onto the most crowded of countertops. Assembling and disassembling this little machine is a cinch, too. 

 MINUS: The Big Mouth was the only winning juicer made of plastic and not containing at least some stainless steel—but a little sturdiness was all we sacrificed for the price.
