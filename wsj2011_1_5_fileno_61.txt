If the Jets win the opening coin toss on Saturday, Rex Ryan should ignore his general practice of deferring the decision to the second half and instead elect to receive the ball first. After all, his team's best chance of taking a quick lead on the Indianapolis Colts may be the initial kickoff return.

Brad Smith and the Jets' return game are where the Jets hold their biggest statistical edge over the Colts heading into the prime-time Wild Card matchup. The Jets are third best in the NFL as a team this year in averaging 25.2 yards per return, and Mr. Smith is averaging 28.6 yards, with a pair of touchdowns in his 50 returns.

What's more, the Colts are dismal at covering kick returns. They rank 31st out of 32 NFL teams, as opponents are averaging 25.8 yards per return.

And when the Jets kick off on Saturday, they also hold a lopsided statistical advantage. New York is third best at covering kicks while Indianapolis is ranked 29th in returning the ball. 

Mr. Smith's special-teams prowess keyed important victories over the Cincinnati Bengals and Pittsburgh Steelers this season (he ran back kicks for touchdowns in both games). And the Jets' special-teams edge over Indianapolis was on display last December, when Mr. Smith returned a kickoff 106 yards for a touchdown when the teams met in the regular season. That return is tied for the second-longest in league history.

If lightning can strike twice inside Lucas Oil Stadium on Saturday night, the Jets may find their way to the Divisional Round.
