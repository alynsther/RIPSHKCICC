BRUSSELS—European Union ambassadors agreed Friday that the bloc should extend sanctions against 13 Syrian officials, not including Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, EU officials said. 

The decision to extend sanctions will be put to EU foreign ministers early next week and could be in place by the end of the week, EU officials said. 

The extra sanctions include travel bans and asset freezes for 13 senior officials from the government, military and intelligence services "involved in the repression" one official said, but won't apply to Mr. Assad. Some EU members, including France, had expressed their support for including him in the measures. 

The sanctions come in addition to a range of reactions already in place, including an arms embargo and an end to trade agreements. The EU had earmarked €129 million in aid to Syria for 2011-13 for various programs to help economic and rural developments, while the European Investment Bank has €1.3 billion in programs for Syria. 

The sanctions package is being imposed more swiftly, going to EU foreign ministers via a written procedure. Foreign ministers would usually have to sign off on such a plan in person; their next scheduled meeting is in Brussels on May 23.
