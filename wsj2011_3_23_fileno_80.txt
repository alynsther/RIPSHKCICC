U.S. home prices fell for a third straight month in January, a government agency said Tuesday, adding to evidence that the housing market is weakening even though the economy is improving. 

Home prices fell 0.3% on a seasonally adjusted basis in January compared with December, according to the Federal Housing Finance Agency's monthly home-price index.

January's index value was 186.5. A reading of 100 is equal to the price of homes in January 1991. December's results were revised down to a 1.0% decline from an initial estimate of a 0.3% drop. The FHFA's index is calculated by using the prices of houses purchased with mortgages backed by government-controlled mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 

The National Association of Realtors reported Monday that sales of existing homes in February dropped 9.6% from a month earlier. The median sales price of $156,100 was the lowest since February 2002. Prices are falling because of the large amount of distressed properties hitting the market.

"We think house prices will continue to face headwinds as the large inventory of foreclosed properties make their way through the market," Barclays Capital economist Theresa Chen said. "Some of this should be offset as demand for homes increases due to the improving economic backdrop."
