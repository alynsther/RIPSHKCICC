NEW DELHI â€“ India's Ministry of Environment and Forests is likely to make a decision on Lavasa Corp.'s hill city project in the third week of January, a person familiar with the matter said Friday. 

A fact-finding team of the ministry will reach the capital, New Delhi, on Jan. 10 after visiting Lavasa's project site, the person said. "A decision will take place once its report is submitted," the person added. The decision is likely to come between Jan. 17 and Jan. 20. 

The ministry on Nov. 25 asked Lavasa, a unit of Hindustan Construction Co., to stop work at the project in western India, saying it violated some environmental rules. It also asked the company why some structures built after 2004 shouldn't be demolished. 

Lavasa then approached the Bombay High Court, which instructed the ministry to send a team to the project site to find out whether environmental rules were violated.
