Shakhtar Donetsk, one of the leading football clubs in Ukraine, is on course to make history when the Champions League reconvenes this week.

The team, coached by Romanian trainer Mircea Lucescu, has never previously reached the knockout rounds of European football's elite club tournament, but is poised to advance to the quarterfinals when it plays host to AS Roma on Tuesday night.

Shakhtar takes a 3-2 aggregate lead into the second leg of this round-of-16 match and, with home-field advantage here, looks certain to progress: Shakhtar has won its last 18 home games, has never lost at its Donbass Arena, and last suffered a home defeat of any kind in October 2008.

Given that just three teams in Italy's Serie A have surrendered more goals than Roma this season, the home team should find scoring chances easy to come by here and Bodog's best-price of evens for a home win is tough to turn down.

The match between Germany's Schalke 04 and Valencia, of Spain, on Wednesday is more evenly balanced. The 1-1 draw in the first leg in Spain means the Germans have a slight edge by virtue of their away goal—under Champions League rules, the first tiebreaker is away goals—but domestic results suggest the Spanish team is in better form.

Valencia won away to Mallorca in La Liga, while Schalke suffered a 1-0 defeat to Bundesliga strugglers Stuttgart. Backing the visitor at 2/1 with Stan James is advised, while a Shakhtar/Valencia double pays around 5/1 with the same firm.
