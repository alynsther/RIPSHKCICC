Evander Holyfield's senior tour continues Saturday when he boxes Sherman Williams, 38, in White Sulphur Springs, W.Va. Mr. Holyfield, 48, suspended by New York in 2005 for "diminished skills," was licensed by West Virginia this week after he passed medical tests and a follow-up eye exam recommended by Nevada. Mr. Holyfield (43-10-2) also has a March bout scheduled in Denmark against 45-year old Brian Nielsen.

Everything really is bigger in Texas. Just ask ESPN, which announced a 20-year, $300 million deal with the University of Texas and IMG College to create a 24-hour Longhorn-specific network, launching in September. Only a handful of football games will be shown on the channel but expect some cultural fare, such as student musicals.
