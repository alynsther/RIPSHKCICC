LONDON—U.K. producer prices accelerated at the fastest rate in two years in February owing largely to rising oil and food prices, adding to the inflationary pressures that could prompt the Bank of England to raise interest rates in coming months. 

The Office for National Statistics said Friday that output prices, those charged at the factory gate, rose 5.3% from a year earlier. It was the highest rate since October 2008 and above January's 5.0% inflation rate, although it was largely in line with expectations. 

Prices rose 0.5% from a month earlier, slower than January's 1.1%. 

Higher output prices from producers will put pressure on retailers to increase their own prices, possibly fueling further rises in the consumer-price index and spurring the BOE to tighten monetary policy. 

The central bank left interest rates on hold at 0.5% Thursday, but investors believe BOE policy makers may raise borrowing costs as early as May to contain inflationary pressures. 

Producers' input prices also rose at their fastest rate since October 2008, by an annual rate of 14.6%. That was an increase from January's 14.1%. 

Economists had forecast output prices would rise 5.3% from a year earlier and input prices would rise 14.5%.

Petroleum, food, alcohol and tobacco products together accounted for more than half of the annual inflation rate, as uprisings in North Africa and the Middle East drove oil prices higher. 

Excluding these, inflation slowed slightly. Core output price inflation—which strips out food, alcohol, energy and tobacco prices—dropped to 3.1% on the year from 3.2% a month earlier. 

Core factory-gate prices rose just 0.1% from a month earlier, down from January's 0.7% increase. 

Chemical and pharmaceutical prices fell 1%, the biggest decline since records began. Other product prices were unchanged on the month, including those for transport equipment and computers.
