  Q: Why is it that so many people fail to remove outside tags and basting stitches that clearly aren't meant to stay on the clothes after they are taken home? And that includes the cardboard Levi's tag on the back that announces to everybody what size you are.   

—L.V., Hoboken, N.J.

 A: The square tags tacked to the sleeves of suit jackets are merely a retail tool, making it easier for shoppers to flip through a rack of suits and discover the brand, fabric content and size, all printed right there on that small patch. When you get home, that outside label should always come off. 

Once, I couldn't resist telling a 20something man that he had forgotten to remove that label. He countered that he had no intention of taking it off; the label telegraphed to his friends he was wearing a "designer" suit. While many folks favor showy logos and labels, I believe clothes should broadcast their quality through great style, craftsmanship and fit.

As for the basting designed to hold lapels and pleats in place until the garment is purchased—pull out those stitches before you get dressed. 

The lone exception is the stitching that sews jacket pockets closed. Many stylish wearers prefer to leave the pockets stitched tight. That renders the pockets useless but also prevents the fabric from bulging or sagging, preserving the silhouette of the jacket. Whether you decide to sacrifice your pockets for a sleek line is entirely up to you.

As for the logo patches on the back of jeans, which don't detach so easily— they still need to come off, in my opinion. I have never liked the billboard effect of those insignias. While I'm watching TV, I use a cheap, metal seam ripper to carefully pull out the stitches one by one.
