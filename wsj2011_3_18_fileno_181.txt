Only Ireland can stop England winning a grand slam in this year's Six Nations, although the English will have to overcome a familiar psychological hurdle to complete its first clean sweep in this tournament since 2003.

Three times in the past decade, England was unbeaten heading into its final game, only to come unstuck on two occasions: On a rain-soaked Sunday in 2000, Scotland thwarted its ancient rival with a 19-13 victory. A year later, the Irish frustrated the English in Dublin.

In 2003, England finally achieved the grand slam with a 42-6 win in Ireland. On Saturday, the English take a perfect record in this year's championship to Dublin's Aviva Stadium.

Ireland boasts an impressive head-to-head record in recent times, having won six of its last seven games against England. Yet this doesn't look like a vintage Irish team—in losses to France and Wales, Declan Kidney's men made numerous handling areas and failed to convert a slew of chances.

Martin Johnson's tough defense won't allow Ireland so many opportunities and English should overcome the four-point handicap offered by most oddsmakers. Backing England with a handicap at evens with Victor Chandler is recommended.

Wales is the only other nation that enters the final round with hopes of lifting the championship. To do so, England would have to lose, while Wales hammers the French by 42 points in Paris—improbable, but Warren Gatland's team is capable of winning the game with an eight-point start, which is also a best-priced evens with Victor Chandler.
