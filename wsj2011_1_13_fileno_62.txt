As one might expect from the name of the eatery, things are a bit bedazzled at Café Kristall—perhaps not surprising, given that Chef Kurt Gutenbrunner's newest Austrian eatery is inside the Swarovski Crystallized boutique. 



Kristall's menu is dominated by Austrian dishes (the Swarovski jewelry brand is also Austrian), but tailored to include soups, salads and lighter entrees for those who lunch and shop in SoHo. A few crystals on display and mirrored surfaces accent the minimalist dining room. Mr. Gutenbrunner's signature style has been recognized with the Michelin star at his fine-dining restaurant Wallsé.

Salads ($9 to $13) include a yellowtail, an octopus carpaccio with black olives and limes and a crab meat with marinated fennel. On the heavier side, there's a spicy egg sandwich ($10) and spätzle with a portion of shrimp and broccoli ($16) and Wiener schnitzel with cucumber salad ($25). The real reason to stop? The pastry counter. 

 Café Kristall, 70 Mercer Street, near Broome, serves lunch 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday to Saturday and 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sunday. 212-274-1500.
