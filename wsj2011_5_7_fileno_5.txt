The Yankees struck twice early for three runs Friday against the Rangers, more than enough scoring for starter Ivan Nova, who largely mowed down the reigning American League champs en route to a 4-1 victory. Yankee outfielder Curtis Granderson gave the team a boost, drilling two home runs deep into the right-field seats and knocking in three runs. New York (18-12) got off to an early start against Texas pitcher Matt Harrison, scoring three runs in the first two frames. Granderson's first blast, in the opening inning, scored Derek Jeter, who singled a soft line drive to right to open the game. 

Nova allowed just two hits and an unearned run over 7 1/3 innings.

 A three-run home run by Jason Pridie in the sixth inning helped the Mets come from behind to beat the Los Angeles Dodgers, 6-3, on Friday night. 

It was the latest surprising contribution from Pridie, a 27-year-old center fielder with 24 major league games to his name. He joined the Mets from Class AAA Buffalo on April 22 as an emergency replacement for Angel Pagan. Though he is currently hitting .243, Pridie has batted in eight runs and notched three homers in his first 13 games. 

Mets pitcher Jonathon Niese labored through 5 2/3 innings, allowing seven hits and three runs. 

Dodger Andre Ethier's ground ball into center field extended his hitting streak to 30 games.
