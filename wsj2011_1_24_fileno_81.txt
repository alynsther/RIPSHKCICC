Ilya Kovalchuk had a goal and two assists, Jason Arnott scored twice and a resurgent Devils team topped the Florida Panthers, extending New Jersey's winning streak to four games.

Brian Rolston and Patrik Elias also scored for the Devils, who have picked up points in seven straight games (6-0-1). Their only blip during the surge was a 3-2 overtime loss at Florida on Jan. 15.

Martin Brodeur made 24 saves for the Devils, who are trying to climb out of a huge hole. They fell to the bottom of the NHL standings with a 10-29-2 record before the hot streak, a slide that cost coach John MacLean his job just before Christmas.
