Offseason acquisition Pedro Feliciano, projected to be the Yankees' top lefty specialist, is expected to miss the start of the season with a muscle injury in his upper back.

The pitcher led the big leagues in appearances in the last few years, but he's not expected to be healed in time for the Yankees' Opening Day on Thursday, manager Joe Girardi said.

He could be replaced on the roster by untested lefty Steve Garrison. After a poor performance Sunday, Garrison has a 5.59 ERA in 9 2/3 spring innings, but Girardi sees potential against lefties. 

"He's done a good job for us against left-handers, and he's a viable option for us," Girardi said.

The Mets say Carlos Beltran is on track to start on Opening Day, even though he has yet to play right field in a Grapefruit League game. Beltran tested his balky knees in the field over the weekend, playing five innings in minor-league games Saturday and Sunday. He reported no pain. Manager Terry Collins, who did a little dance at the sight of Beltran in uniform Saturday, said the team will decide Monday morning what the next step is for Beltran. The Mets have only three exhibition games left.

Two-time defending women's champion UConn was on the ropes Sunday afternoon in the Sweet Sixteen in Philadelphia. Georgetown held a seven-point lead with a little more than nine minutes to play when UConn coach Geno Auriemma turned to 5-foot-4, Queens-bred Lorin Dixon. Four steals, four assists, two rebounds and two baskets later, the UConn senior, Christ the King alum and reserve guard had sparked the Huskies to a 68-63 win. "Lorin Dixon just had an incredible effect on her team," Auriemma said on the TV broadcast after the game. "God bless her."
