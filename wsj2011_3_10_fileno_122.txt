Four weeks before the 2011 Masters, the world's elite golfers will attempt to fine-tune their games when they tee off at the second World Golf Championship event of the year, the Cadillac Championship in Miami.

Tiger Woods has won no fewer than six times here previously and he would be a good candidate to add to his haul this weekend, but given that Woods hasn't won a tournament in over a year and is still implementing changes to his swing, he should probably be avoided.

European golfers dominated the last WGC event, the World Match Play Championships, but amid some poor performances by America's best players, Matt Kuchar went quietly about his work, beating Rickie Fowler and YE Yang before losing to eventual champion Luke Donald in the semifinals. 

That showing was entirely in keeping with Kuchar's season so far: Without making much noise, he has achieved four top-10 finishes in his six starts in 2011. The Blue Monster course at Doral rewards accuracy and the consistent Kuchar, who tied for third here last year, should be backed each-way at a general 25/1.

Graeme McDowell finished with a blistering course record 64 to finish sixth overall at the Honda Classic last weekend. Unibet pairs the Northern Irishman in a 72-hole match with Lee Westwood, who has yet to fire on all cylinders this season and has no form to speak of at the Cadillac Championship. The 3/4 available for McDowell here is highly recommended.
