In women's tennis, No. 1 used to mean "best." Lately it means better. Kind of. Barely.

The last four women to reach the top ranking—Caroline Wozniacki, Dinara Safina, Jelena Jankovic and Ana Ivanovic—have won a total of one Grand Slam singles title and have never been considered true favorites to win major tournaments. Many even thought Ms. Wozniacki would struggle in her first-round Australian Open match on Monday. (She beat Gisela Dulko in straight sets.)

The poor standing of recent Nos. 1 has pundits wondering whether today's top-ranked players are worse than those in the past or whether everyone else is just better. It's a little of both. The women's game has more depth today, although Serena Williams, No. 1 as recently as last year, has won 65% of her matches against top-10 opponents in her career.

The men's game shows this can be cyclical. For about a decade starting in 1995, 10 different men were No. 1, and only one, Gustavo Kuerten, has a career winning record against top-10 players. Then along came Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, who have stomped on the top 10 at a 67% clip and won 21 of the past 23 major titles.

The 20-year-old Ms. Wozniacki may not be a Federer-in-waiting, but Kim Clijsters, the U.S. Open champ and a contender to retake No. 1 this year, started her career with an identical 18-26 record vs. the top-10.

Here are the career records against top-10 players for the women who've been No. 1 since Steffi Graf took over the ranking in 1987.
