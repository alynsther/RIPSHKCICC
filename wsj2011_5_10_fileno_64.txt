Bombay Heights is part of a small wave of eateries to crop up on Bedford Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant, which is seeing a shift in cuisine and customers as residents fill in the new condos nearby.

Bombay Heights, a recent addition to Brooklyn's Bedford Stuyvesant neighborhood, brings new flavors to a changing avenue.

"We're bringing fine dining to this area," said co-owner Sadek Ibrahim, who opened the restaurant six months ago with business partner Ashraf Chowdhury.

During lunch, prices on the dinner menu are reduced 25%. Many orders begin with the samosa ($2.75), which comes stuffed with spiced minced-meat or vegetables. The best-selling dish is the chicken tikka masala ($9.95), which is marinated in fresh herbs and spices and barbecued over charcoal. Pair the dish with basmati rice and garlic naan. 

Though the restaurant seats about 28, expect to find a seat right away—the place is still a secret gem. There are also lunch box sets or a filling daily special to go, the primary option for the neighborhood lunch crowd.
