European stock markets advanced as euro-zone sentiment improved after Japan pledged to buy more than 20% of a bond offering by the European Financial Stability Facility this month and after the European Central Bank bought distressed euro-zone debt.

The Stoxx Europe 600 index ended up 1.3% at 281.98. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 closed 1% higher at 6014.03, Germany's DAX added 1.2% to 6941.57, and France's CAC-40 climbed 1.6% at 3861.92. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up about 0.4% at 11688.23 around the European market close.

Banks posted strong gains on the news from Japan and the ECB, with the Stoxx Europe 600 banks index closing up 1.9%.

Commodity stocks strengthened following what were initially considered better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings from U.S. aluminum giant Alcoa after Monday's closing bell on Wall Street. At the same time, gains in base-metal prices helped the Stoxx Europe 600 basic resources index push up 1.7%.

Alcoa shares later lost ground after the U.S. opened for trading, slipping 1.2%. Traders said they were disappointed by the smaller-than-expected rise in revenue.

In London,  ARM Holdings rose 7% on the back of comments by Jim Cramer on CNBC's "Mad Money" late Monday. Mr. Cramer said the 200% gain in the stock since Oct. 16, 2009, may just be the beginning for ARM, which he believes is a takeover target.

On the data front, U.S. November wholesale inventories were mildly disappointing, but markets seemed to take little notice of the figure.

Overall, the markets' tone was bullish, with analysts continuing to see prospects for equities in 2011 on the upside. Strategists at UBS said they target 310 for the Stoxx Europe 600 index by the end of 2011, with 10% upside still seen from current levels despite the rally since the summer of 2010.

  Siemens gained 3% after the German electronics and engineering group said it expects "a very strong increase" in new orders in the fiscal first quarter. The company also forecast that revenue and income from continuing operations will rise year-over-year.

Despite Tuesday's equity-market gains, some market commentators were still concerned about the euro-zone debt saga, with many skeptical that Portugal will be able to continue without tapping the European Union/International Monetary Fund facility.

"This week's bond auctions in Portugal, Spain and Italy are being regarded by the market as a crucial litmus test of contagion risk in the euro zone," said Rabobank. "A lack of investor interest at these auctions would likely trigger a wave of euro selling." 

In the currency markets, the euro firmed after declines overnight as the European Central Bank again stepped in to buy the bonds of nations on the periphery of the euro zone, tightening yield spreads and lifting risk appetite in the foreign-exchange markets. 

In midday trade in New York, the single currency was trading at $1.2965, up from $1.2954 late Monday, while the dollar was at 83.39 yen, up from 82.73 yen.

By the close of European equity markets, spot gold on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose $2.90 to $1377 per ounce. Light, sweet, crude for February delivery was up $1.77 at $91.20 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Looking ahead, a raft of data is due Wednesday, with figures such as Germany gross domestic product, euro zone industrial production due in Europe, while in the U.S. the Federal Reserve presents its beige book.
