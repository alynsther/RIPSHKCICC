The boyfriend of a slain fashion designer who was found dead in a Manhattan hotel-spa last month has been indicted on a murder charge, according to court papers.

Prosecutors plan to arraign  Nicholas Brooks on second-degree murder Tuesday, a stepped-up count from the attempted murder charge authorities tagged him with in connection with  Sylvie Cachay's death on Dec. 9.

The upgraded charge comes days after the medical examiner's office last week ruled Ms. Cachay's death a homicide.

Ms. Cachay, 33 years old, was found dead in an overflowing bathtub at the Soho House in the Meatpacking District. A spokeswoman for the medical examiner said last week that the autopsy found that Ms. Cachay died of neck compression and drowning.

Authorities have cited video surveillance footage in arguing that Mr. Brooks was responsible for Ms. Cachay's death. Prosecutors say the cameras show Mr. Brooks was the only other person to spend a considerable amount of time in the room where Ms. Cachay was found.

A spokeswoman for Manhattan District Attorney  Cyrus Vance declined to comment on the grand-jury indictment, which will be fully unsealed Tuesday. 

The 24-year-old Mr. Brooks, who is currently being held without bail, is the son of composer  Joseph Brooks, who won an Academy Award for "You Light Up My Life" in the 1970s. Nicholas Brooks is scheduled to appear in court Tuesday, when the formal charges will be brought.

His attorney,  Jeffrey Hoffman, didn't immediately return a phone call Monday seeking comment. Mr. Hoffman has previously said his client is innocent.

Mr. Brooks faces a maximum sentence of 25 years to life if convicted on the murder charge.
