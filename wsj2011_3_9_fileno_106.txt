BRIC Arts Media announced on Tuesday that musician  Andrew Bird will open the nonprofit's 2011 season of Celebrate Brooklyn! with a free performance on June 10. Prior to the concert, which begins at 8 p.m. at the Prospect Park Bandshell, BRIC will host this year's Celebrate Brooklyn! Opening Night Gala, the proceeds of which provide funds for each year's free events. Also helping to raise funds will be the Decemberists, who will perform a benefit show on June 14. The Celebrate Brooklyn! Festival serves upward of 250,000 New Yorkers each season. 

Celebrate Brooklyn!, one of the city's longest-running free, outdoor performing-arts festivals, was launched in 1979 to help revitalize Prospect Park. Since its inception, the series has presented more than 2,000 artists and ensembles, and has developed a membership program with more than 500 seasonal members.
