Most Asian markets ended higher Tuesday, with a strong outlook for nonferrous and precious metals driving several stocks in the sector, while hopes for better semiconductor memory prices boosted shares of chip makers.

Those gains helped regional stocks end on a mostly positive note, overcoming weakness among several steelmakers on concerns about their earnings.

Japan's Nikkei Stock Average gained 0.2%, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 0.8%, South Korea's Kospi slipped 0.2% and Taiwan's Taiex advanced 0.7%. India's Sensex ended up 1.1%, helped by Tata Consultancy Services, after the country's largest software exporter beat earnings expectations Monday.

In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index finished little changed, while China's Shanghai Composite—which tumbled 3% in the previous session and traded lower for most of Tuesday on the central bank's move on Friday to tighten banks' reserve requirements—ended 0.1% higher on bargain buying in banking stocks.

"I think China has economic momentum that they wouldn't want to stop," said Bell Potter senior client adviser Stuart Smith in Australia. "Any tightening is meant to stymie speculation and that's a good thing."

The state-run China Securities Journal reported that China's gross domestic product grew 10.1% in 2010, compared with a 9.2% increase in 2009. The report cited a source at China's top economic planning agency.

Shares of China Construction Bank Corp. climbed 0.6% and Industrial & Commercial Bank of China added 0.7% in Shanghai.

Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were up 15 points in screen trade.

"As money comes back into emerging markets and Asia, it's no longer as simple as buying liquid large caps," said Ben Collett, head of Japanese equities at Louis Capital Markets. "What I'm looking for right now [are] laggards—companies that have high cash balances and, especially in Japan, making moves to use that cash."

Nonferrous metal stocks broadly climbed across the region after Morgan Stanley issued robust outlooks for aluminum, zinc, gold and silver, while keeping a positive view on copper prices.

Shares of Aluminum Corp. of China climbed 0.7% in Shanghai and surged 5.5% in Hong Kong, while Korea Zinc added 2.2% in Seoul.

Elsewhere in the region, Alumina jumped 3.7% and Newcrest Mining added 0.6% in Sydney. Sterlite Industries rose 1.1% in Mumbai trading.

But many steelmakers declined amid concerns earnings will come in below expectations.

In Tokyo, Nippon Steel lost 1.4% after the Nikkei reported that higher raw material costs could see the company post a group pretax profit for the current fiscal year of around 220 billion yen ($2.65 billion), roughly 30 billion yen below the firm's forecast.

In Australia, BlueScope Steel shed 0.9% after Macquarie downgraded the stock to underperform from neutral and cut its earnings per share forecast for 2011 by 32%, saying the continued strength of the Australian dollar is expected to offset higher steel prices.

On mainland bourses, Maanshan Iron & Steel Co. fell 0.6% and Angang Steel declined 0.9% after the two firms issued earnings guidance suggesting they posted losses for the fourth quarter. In Hong Kong, Angang's shares retraced early declines to rise 0.5% after losing 2.7% over the previous three sessions, while Maanshan declined 2.1%.

Also in Hong Kong, shares of Hutchison Whampoa, which had tacked on nearly 20% in 2011 to Monday, fell 2.4%. The drop came on news the company is planning an initial public offering of its southern China port assets in Singapore. The listing could raise up to $6 billion, according to a person familiar with the situation.

In Sydney, iron-ore producer Fortescue Metals Group jumped 8% after a strong fourth-quarter production report showing shipments rose 12.6% from a year earlier.

A few regional technology stocks declined after a 6.2% drop in Apple Inc. shares in the Frankfurt market, following news that Chief Executive Steve Jobs is taking a medical leave of absence.

"This [Apple news] may trigger a broad profit taking in the U.S. equity market," said Kenichi Hirano, operating officer at Tachibana Securities.

Shares of Kyocera dropped 0.7% in Tokyo, while Apple component supplier TPK Holding Co. fell 2.4% in Taipei.

But makers of dynamic random access memory, or DRAM chips, rallied after the Nikkei reported Tuesday that Elpida Memory plans to raise prices by about 10% as early as this month. Elpida added 1.1% after shedding 37% over the course of 2010. Samsung Electronics added 2.1% and Hynix Semiconductor rose 2.8% in Seoul, with Inotera Memories climbing 2.5% and Nanya Technology Corp. gaining 1.5% in Taipei.

Shares of Powerchip Technology Corp., Taiwan's biggest maker of computer memory chips by capacity, climbed 2.8%, with Vice President Eric Tang saying he expects global prices of DRAM chips to bottom in the first quarter.

Elsewhere, New Zealand's NZX 50 slipped 0.3% and Philippine shares declined 1.8%. In afternoon trading, Singapore's Straits Times index rose 0.1%, Indonesian shares declined 0.4% and Thailand's SET index ended up 0.1%.

In foreign-exchange markets, the euro rebounded against major currencies and was buying $1.3356 from $1.3296 late Monday in Toronto, and 110.20 yen from 109.96 yen. The dollar was buying 82.52 yen, compared with 82.67 yen.

The gains came after the Spanish newspaper El Pais reportedly cited Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Zhukov as saying that Russia is considering buying Spanish bonds.

Spot gold was at $1,367, up $5.50 from late London trade on Monday.

February crude-oil futures were down 20 cents at $91.34 on Globex.
