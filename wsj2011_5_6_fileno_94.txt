It worked for "My Fair Lady," the beloved musical based on George Bernard Shaw's "Pygmalion." Now New York's Lincoln Center Theater is hoping to turn another Shaw play into a hit musical with "A Minister's Wife."

The new production, opening Sunday, is a reinterpretation of Mr. Shaw's late 19th-century play, "Candida," about a love triangle between a leftist preacher, his independent-minded wife and a much younger poet. It looks like a Victorian drawing-room drama until the orchestra appears behind a scrim and the actors begin singing.

Austin Pendleton, who wrote the book for the show, said he thought that "Candida," like "Pygmalion," contained the seeds of a musical: "The core of it is so full of emotional ache that I thought that could work."

The musical opens just as the Broadway theater season is winding down, with Tony Award nominees announced this past week. Unlike some of those shows, it isn't punctuated by stand-alone musical numbers as much as it is woven through with music. Plenty of dialogue is sung and songs can last the better part of 10 minutes. "The composer didn't follow any rules," said actor Bobby Steggert, who plays the poet Eugene Marchbanks. 

The first incarnation of the show debuted at the Writers' Theatre in Glencoe, Ill., in 2009. While revising it in New York, Mr. Pendleton locked himself in a Lincoln Center basement room with composer Joshua Schmidt, lyricist Jan Levy Tranen and director Michael Halberstam to hash over changes.

Though much of the musical includes Mr. Shaw's lines, Mr. Pendleton added new scenes and transitions. When writing in Mr. Shaw's voice, he would reread the entire play to get the feeling of each character. "It took a while," he said. "It's a very inefficient way to work."
