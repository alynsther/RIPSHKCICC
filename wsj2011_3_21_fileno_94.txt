Fans of the Mets or Yankees have an idea of how their teams' players should be "valued" heading into this season. But for a more objective view, sometimes it helps to watch the world of fantasy baseball.

This past weekend in New York, experts took part in the Tout Wars fantasy auctions (one is for American League players, the other, NL). In a fantasy auction, players have a $260 budget to spend on 23 players, and those players' real-life statistics in select categories determine the fantasy team's success. Some Mets had the biggest jumps from last year's value, with first baseman Ike Davis being drafted at $21 this year after going undrafted in last year's Tout Wars. Outfielder Angel Pagan also saw a big jump, as did pitcher Jonathon Niese.

But that's cold comfort for any Mets fan who's counting the days until starter Johan Santana's return. Predictably, the sidelined ace's value plummeted in this year's auction to the minimum $1, from $25 last year, making him the biggest decliner on either team. Mets outfielders Jason Bay ($19) and Carlos Beltran ($11) also each dropped $7 from their 2010 price.

Overall, the 12 experts who drafted exclusively from the AL rosters spent $301 of their league-wide budget of $3,120 on Yankees (9.6%). The 12 NL experts spent only $171 on the Mets (5.5%).

To be sure, fantasy values can be skewed. New Yankees reliever Rafael Soriano fell to $5 this year from $20 last year because he's no longer the main saves guy on his team, and saves are the key stat for fantasy relievers. But the pitcher who is the main saves guy, Mariano Rivera, is steady as she comes in fantasy auctions, too: $24 this year, the same as in 2010.
