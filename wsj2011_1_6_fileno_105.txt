HONG KONGâ€”The value of luxury property transactions in Hong Kong surged 40% in 2010, exceeding the level recorded during the 1997 property boom, real-estate agency Centaline Property Ltd. said in a research report Thursday. 

The report, based on official data, said the value of transactions of luxury properties, or properties valued at 10 million Hong Kong dollars (US$1.3 million) or more, totaled HK$196.67 billion last year, the highest since the government began issuing electronic property transaction data in 1996. 

The value of transactions in the luxury sector totaled HK$173.8 billion in 1997. 

The number of luxury apartment transactions in 2010 rose 33% to 8,642, and was the highest number since 1997, when 9,532 transactions were recorded, the report said. 

The overall value of Hong Kong's property transactions surged 34% in 2010 to the highest level since 1997, as ample liquidity, tight supply and record low interest rates helped boost prices for the second straight year. 

Sales in the luxury residential sector received a boost from mainland Chinese buyers, who deem Hong Kong properties to be good investments, analysts said.
