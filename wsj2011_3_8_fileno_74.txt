North Carolina's season is coming full-circle. The Tar Heels rose to No. 6 in the latest AP poll, their first top-10 visit since November. UNC wasn't even ranked for half of the season but has won 12 of 13 due to strides by freshmen Harrison Barnes and Kendall Marshall. They, Duke and Notre Dame will jockey for a No. 1 seed, with Ohio State, Kansas and Pitt likely to get the other three.

A new study found that big games that have close scores trigger a sharp rise in traffic fatalities for fans of the winning team. Researchers at North Carolina State and South Carolina evaluated traffic deaths after 271 pro and college football and basketball games from 2001 to 2008 and found that nailbiters were much more likely to result in deaths than blowouts. But only the winning side's fans saw the rise in deaths, which the researchers hypothesized is because of a surge in testosterone levels.
