NEW DELHI -- Intel Capital, the venture capital arm of the chipmaker, has announced $18 million in investments in five Indian companies. 

The venture capital fund will invest in PolicyBazaar.com, an online insurance-comparison site, and Sudhir Srivastava Robotics Surgery Center Pvt. Ltd., which focuses on bringing advanced robotics to medical care in India.

Intel Capital also will make three follow-on investments in online travel company Yatra.com, open-source provider WSO2, and mobile-media company July Systems. 

The company did not divulge details of the investments made from its Indian technology fund. With these new stakes, the fund would have spent about 70% of its corpus.

The venture capital firm said it won't start the next fund until it spends the capital in this fund. Intel Capital wants to invest in companies that focus on education, cloud computing, information technology and related services. 

"We are investing very aggressively in India," said Arvind Sodhani, executive vice president of Intel Corp. and president of Intel Capital, and added "we hope this will not be before too long."
