Jewelry auctions in Geneva next month cover the noble to the romantic in brilliant diamonds, emeralds, sapphires and rubies.

On May 17, in a sale comprising 491 lots, Sotheby's will offer a sumptuous tiara that epitomizes the luxurious life of the European aristocracy during the Belle Époque. Billed by Sotheby's as the most important emerald and diamond tiara to come to auction in 30 years, the diadem is composed of 11 rare Colombian emerald pear-shaped drops that in total weigh more than 500 carats. The tiara was commissioned around 1900 by Guido Count von Henckel, First Prince von Donnersmarck, for his second wife Princess Katharina. 

"This extraordinary tiara is simply stunning," says David Bennett, chairman of Sotheby's jewelry department for Europe and the Middle East. "Few jewels evoke more vividly the splendor and glamour of the [period]." 

The piece is expected to fetch 4.6 million Swiss francs to 9.2 million francs (€3.6 million to €7.2 million).

Another major highlight at Sotheby's will be a lovely, intense-pink diamond weighing 10.99 carats mounted as a ring. The stone comes from a private collection and hasn't appeared on the market in more than 30 years (estimate: 8.3 million francs-14.8 million francs). Mr. Bennett says he has never known demand for colored diamonds to be so strong. 

Spearheading Christie's 321-lot sale May 18 will be the most romantic of jewels in a heart-shaped diamond weighing 56.15 carats. This "sensational" stone is a "perfect heart" in terms of the four Cs of diamond assessment—carat, clarity, color and cut, says Jean-Marc Lunel, who heads Christie's jewelry department in Geneva. Polished diamonds in excess of 50 carats are extremely rare, and less than a handful of perfect hearts have appeared at auction in the past 20 years. The unmounted stone is estimated at 8.6 million francs to 11.5 million francs.

Among other impressive stones at Christie's will be an intense blue, internally flawless diamond weighing 6.60 carats, estimated at 4 million francs to 6 million francs, that Mr. Lunel describes as "wonderful." Christie's currently holds the world record per carat for a blue diamond, achieved in 2010 when a 10.95-carat blue diamond set in a ring by Bulgari sold in New York for $15.76 million (€10.8 million).

Christie's will also feature emeralds with a noble connection in two rectangular-cut stones weighing 17.97 and 15.99 carats that once belonged to Eugénie de Montijo, Countess of Teba, the wife of Emperor Napoléon III, who ascended the French throne in 1852. The empress loved jewelry. As green was her favorite color, she had a particular fondness for emeralds. The stones are expected to fetch 200,000 francs to 300,000 francs.

An unusual item at Christie's will be a rare imperial Mughal spinel necklace with three of the 11 polished beads inscribed with the name of Shah Jahangir, who ruled in India from 1605 to 1627. According to Christie's, Mughal rulers had a great affection for spinels, a hard, glassy mineral. They treasured them as protective talismans to be worn into battle (estimate: 1.45 million francs-2.4 million francs).

Both Christie's and Sotheby's will have a wide range of jewels by top-league 20th- and 21st-century designers in the Geneva sales.

Mr. Bennett of Sotheby's says one of his favorite pieces in his sale is an Art Deco diamond bracelet by Boucheron from around 1925. The intricate piece embellished with stylized roses is "like lace," Mr. Bennett says (estimate: 110,000 francs-165,000 francs). Sotheby's will auction no fewer than 50 pieces by Cartier, 39 jewels by Van Cleef & Arpels as well as 35 items by Bulgari.

Twenty-first century creations at Christie's are represented by a pair of sapphire and diamond earrings by the Indian jeweler Bhagat. They are wonderfully modern, yet reflect a decorative, Asian heritage (estimate: 190,000 francs-280,000 francs). A pair of emerald and diamond pendant earrings by contemporary Geneva jeweler Bogh-Art also make an impact in both form and color (estimate: 280,000 francs-350,000 francs).
