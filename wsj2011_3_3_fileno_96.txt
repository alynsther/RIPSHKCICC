Players who appeared in at least 100 NBA games after leading Division I in either points, rebounds or assists since 1996-97*

Brigham Young guard Jimmer Fredette learned this week that teammate Brandon Davies had been dismissed for violating the school's honor code.

And that's not the only bad omen for Fredette. If he runs away with college basketball's scoring title, as he's threatening to do, history says he's unlikely to scorch the NCAA tournament or thrive in the pros. 

Between 1996-97 and last season, 37 players led major college basketball in per-game points, rebounds or assists at least once. Only six won an NCAA tournament game in the same season. None made it to the Final Four, only nine appeared in 100 NBA games (although Reggie Williams and Blake Griffin should clear that threshold soon) and only two—Griffin and Tim Duncan—have become All-Stars. 

The record of leading scorers is especially dismal, mainly because most played for lower-tier programs against middling competition. Fredette's collegiate profile is perhaps most similar to that of Davidson's Stephen Curry and Gonzaga's Adam Morrison—two players who gained national attention and won multiple NCAA tournament games. Fredette had better hope his career path mirrors Curry's: He's averaged 18 points per game for the Golden State Warriors over two years. Morrison, meanwhile, was the third pick in the 2006 draft, but he hit fewer than 38% of his shots in all three of his NBA seasons and started a total of 28 games. He didn't make an NBA roster this year.
