Asian shares were dragged down Thursday as a tumble in energy markets Wednesday spooked investors, while selling in Sydney stocks was made worse by disappointing jobs data that also weighed on the Australian dollar.

"I believe the equity correction we fear is coming is closer than we think," said Southern Cross Equities Director Charlie Aitken in Sydney. "I simply do not like the whacky intraday volatility we are seeing in currencies, commodities, bonds and global/local equities. Volatility like this across all asset classes is never a precursor to a rally," he said.

Australia's S&P/ASX 200 dropped 1.8% to 4,696.10, South Korea's Kospi shed 2% to 2,122.65 and Japan's Nikkei Stock Average declined 1.5% to 9,716.65.

China's Shanghai Composite gave up 1.4% to 2,844.08, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index lost 0.9% to 23,073.76, and India's Sensex dropped 1.3% to 18,335.79.

Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were down 68 points in screen trade Thursday, after the benchmark average fell more than 130 points in regular trading overnight.

The broad losses followed a tumble in energy prices Wednesday. A plunge in gasoline futures triggered a five-minute trading halt on Nymex for the first time in two years and pressured June crude-oil futures down $5.67 a barrel, or 5.5%.

The oil contract was recently down $1.31 at $96.90 on Globex, surrendering early gains after failing to reclaim the $100-a-barrel psychological level. Spot gold, meanwhile, was at $1,488.20 a troy ounce, down $12.70 from its New York settlement Wednesday.

Worries about Greece's debt crisis added to the selling pressure. Athens was brought to a halt Wednesday by protests against Greece's austerity measures, increasing concern that Greece could default on its debt next year.

Resource-sector stocks tracked the broad losses suffered in commodity prices and were among those hit hard. Woodside Petroleum gave up 2.5% and BHP Billiton dropped 2.6% in Sydney, with Inpex losing 3.6% in Tokyo and Hindalco Industries sliding 4.7% in Mumbai.

Cnooc's 1.4% drop in Hong Kong during the session erased the stock's gains in 2011 to date. Aluminum Corp. of China and gold miner Zijin Mining Group lost 2% and 2.2%, respectively; in Shanghai, the stocks fell 2.2% and 2.5%, respectively.

The drop in Sydney was aided by a further jolt from the April jobs report, which showed the country shed 22,100 jobs in April against consensus for a 17,000 increase during the month.

The worse-than-expected result cost more than 1 U.S. cent for the Australian dollar in foreign-exchange trade at one point. The Aussie, which dropped as low as $1.0573 from the session's $1.0705 high, had recovered a little more recently and was fetching $1.0602.

Stephen Walters, chief economist at J.P. Morgan, said the weak employment number will give the Reserve Bank of Australia more time to consider its next move on rates. "The pressure is still there on the Reserve Bank to nudge up the cash rate but I don't think they will be doing it in June," he said.

Outside the resources sector, Westpac Banking dropped 1% and James Hardie Industries SE slid 2.8%.

In Tokyo, Toyota Motor rose 3.1% even after the company reported a 77% drop in earnings for the January-to-March quarter. It expects earthquake-hit production to recover sooner than it indicated earlier.

Yamaha Motor jumped 4.3% after posting improved earnings.

But those gains failed to offset losses in several other stocks amid heightened risk aversion and weak results from some other companies.

Shares of Olympus tumbled 5.6% and Terumo dropped 3.4% after their earnings reports disappointed.

Singapore Telecommunications rose 0.6% despite posting a small drop in fourth-quarter earnings. Southeast Asia's biggest telecommunications firm by revenue announced a surprise special dividend of 10 Singapore cents (8.1 U.S. cents) a share.

Elsewhere in the region, Taiwan's Taiex rose 0.2%, while Philippine shares ended 0.5% lower and New Zealand's NZX 50 gave up 0.5%. Singapore's Straits Times Index dropped 1.5%, Indonesian shares declined 0.8% and Thailand's SET fell 1.3%.

In foreign-exchange markets, the euro also failed to hold on to the gains it recorded against the U.S. dollar and the yen earlier in the day, as its rebound from overnight losses evaporated amid a wave of risk aversion across asset classes and worries about Greece's debt situation.

The currency was recently buying $1.4181 against $1.4192 in late New York trade Wednesday, and was at 114.30 yen versus ¥115.00. The dollar was at ¥80.75 compared with ¥81.05.

"The U.S. dollar is strong due to the commodity route, and the euro is coming under increasing pressure because of the Greek situation, and it's hard to see the positions reversing any time soon," said Western Union Business Solution corporate-dealing manager Chris Hunter in Auckland.

Sentiment was also dented by Standard & Poor's comment that Portuguese banks could require more significant government support, which could place downward pressure on the country's sovereign ratings.

Lead Japanese government bond futures were up 0.03 at 140.73 points and the 10-year yield was unchanged at 1.120%.
