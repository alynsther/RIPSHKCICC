 IF CHARLESTON, Savannah's sister city to the north, is a lady who lunches, then Savannah is a nighttime gal. It maintains appearances, too, but the spirit is Holly Golightly with a Southern accent, Givenchy with Frye biker boots. It has history, but it sure isn't "old."

Maybe it's because the genteel coastal city—famous for its downtown street grid of 22 meticulous park-like squares—has had to adapt its traditional southern customs to include more youth-inspired interests. 

You can't walk down a street of its historic district without seeing signs—both literal and otherwise—for the Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD), a private university that since opening in 1979 has spread its wings over the old part of the city, buying and renovating many of the town's boarded-up gems: Victorians, Queen Annes and Romanesque Revivals, among them. 

The result is an easy-going Southern Gothic-vibed city with a preservation-conscientious youth and fresh-paint future.

The 1733-established city of roughly 130,000 inhabitants has an aura as shaggy-chic as its fabled live oaks maned in Spanish moss. About 15 years ago, though, the flat-terrain, subtropical city—settled as a second-chance respite for debtor-prisoners—witnessed an identity crisis, getting lost in "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil"-mania. Fans of the book crammed pop-up "Midnight" memorabilia kiosks, tour trolleys and "ghost walks," seeking out its graveyard settings and spooky mansions.

Savannah has since moved on. Today, the rich culinary fare of the city—Lowcountry-style seafood, barbecue and soul—mix it up with green market-inspired cuisine. A century-old Mediterranean Revival is now a gas station and gourmet foods store. On the bustling main drag, Broughton Street,  Urban Outfitters

 is joined by cutting-edge boutiques. And the old guard Telfair Academy museum has a fine arts neighbor in the architecturally modern Jepson Center.

Which is not to say back alleys aren't still called "lanes," or oyster-and-pig roasts on neighboring Tybee Island are no longer steeped in local fish-camp-hunt club tradition. Savannah is still...Savannah, only with more facial scruff, less blue hair wash. January's a pleasant time to get to know her, little black dress with biker boots and all.
