Asian stocks traded mostly lower Friday as commodity-related shares were battered by falling crude-oil and metals prices in jittery markets ahead of U.S. nonfarm payrolls data for April. 

Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 0.4% to 23,159.14, China's Shanghai Composite dropped 0.3% to 2,863.89, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 gave up 0.2% to 4,743.0 and Taiwan's Taiex shed 0.5% to 8,977.23. 

Big losses were suffered by Japanese and South Korean stocks as those markets reopened after holidays, with the Nikkei Stock Average falling 1.5% to 9,859.20 in Tokyo and the Kospi losing 1.5% to 2,147.45 in Seoul. India's Sensex rose 1.7% to 18,518.81 after a record nine-session losing streak. 

Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were up 29 points in screen trade, ahead of Friday's nonfarm payrolls data for April later in the global day. 

The steep overnight drop in the crude-oil and other metals came after the U.S. Labor Department stunned markets by reporting that applications for jobless benefits jumped by 43,000 to 474,000 in the week ended April 30. 

Those losses follow a recent correction that started with a sell-off in silver and spread quickly to other commodities. Analysts are now divided as they debate whether the slide marked the beginning of a sustained downtrend for crude-oil and other metals. 

Crude futures' sharp fall Thursday virtually removes the chance of fresh price highs for at least two months, barring a major exogenous event, said Jim Ritterbusch, president of oil trading advisory firm Ritterbusch & Associates. 

Not everyone agreed with that view, however. 

"Last night was just a knee-jerk reaction to a pop in the U.S. dollar and we saw some panic selling in commodities...It's not the start of a global economic meltdown and I wouldn't be surprised if things calm down tonight," said RBS's Sydney-based head of sales, Justin Gallagher. 

Several resource sector stocks took a beating, with Cnooc Ltd. falling 2.3% and gold miner Zhaojin Mining Industry Co. shedding 4.5% in Hong Kong, PetroChina Co. losing 2.2% in Shanghai, and Inpex Corp. tumbling 6.2% in Tokyo. 

Mining heavyweights BHP Billiton Ltd. and Rio Tinto Ltd. each skidded 1.9% in Sydney, Korea Zinc Co. finished 7.5% lower and Sterlite Industries India Ltd. gave up 1.2% in Mumbai. 

"It's a bit early for bottom fishing in commodity stocks, because these things tend to overshoot, but I think the bulks will hold up because the fundamentals haven't changed," said RBS Morgans investment adviser, Chris MacDonald. 

Commodity prices themselves remained choppy, adding to anxiety in the market place. 

June Nymex crude-oil futures, having plummeted 8.6% or $9.44 to $99.80 a barrel overnight, briefly climbed back above $100 before taking another plunge in electronic trading. The front-month contract was recently down $1.42 at $98.38 a barrel. 

Spot gold prices rose $12.70 to $1,485.80 a troy ounce, while spot silver was bid up nine cents at $34.75 an ounce, according to Kitco.com. 

Airline stocks benefited from the lower oil prices, with Australia's Qantas Airways Ltd. rising 3.3%, Japan's All Nippon Airways Ltd. gaining 0.8%, Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airlines Ltd. climbing 3.2% and Korean Air Lines Co. advancing 1.6%. 

Indian stocks also rose as a nine-session long losing streak attracted some bargain hunters. The advance was led by a 5.2% rise in ICICI Bank Ltd. and a 5.5% advance in Tata Motors Ltd., both of which have suffered sharp declines recently. 

Shares of South Korean shipbuilders declined as the weakness in crude-oil prices dimmed hopes for an expansion of offshore oil-development projects. Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. dropped 4% and Samsung Heavy Industries fell 5.4%. 

In Tokyo, Honda Motor Co. fell 4.7% after the company expanded a previously announced recall of certain models to fix a potential airbag problem and as a stronger yen weighed. 

The market was also disappointed to find out over the three-day holiday that car production in the key North American market will remain limited through the summer due to parts shortages from Japan, said Yoshihiro Okumura, general manager of research at Chibagin Asset Management. 

Tokyo Electric Power Co. climbed 6.8% after ventilators were switched on inside the contaminated No.1 reactor building at the stricken Fukushima Daiichi nuclear complex Thursday. 

Among other markets, New Zealand's NZX-50 rose 0.2% and Philippine shares fell 0.7%. Singapore's Straits Times Index shed 0.3%, Indonesian shares lost 0.5% and Thailand's SET lost 2.1%. 

In foreign exchange markets, the yen consolidated against the euro and the dollar after climbing sharply Thursday. The dollar was at 80.44 yen from ¥80.05 in late New York, and well off its U.S. session low of ¥79.57. The euro was fetching ¥116.83 from ¥116.43, after it hit a five-week low of ¥116.15 Thursday.

Against the dollar, the euro was at $1.4525 from $1.4541, as appetite for the single currency was weakened by Thursday's less-hawkish-than-expected comments from European Central Bank chief Jean-Claude Trichet. The ECB left interest rates on hold, as expected.

Trade was relatively thin, with many Tokyo traders still away for Japan's Golden Week holidays and on caution ahead of key U.S. nonfarm payroll data later in the global day.
