BRUSSELSâ€”The North Atlantic Treaty Organization Tuesday said it had agreed to launch an operation to enforce an arms embargo against Libya. 

It said that top operational commander, Adm. James Stavridis, is activating NATO ships and aircraft in the Mediterranean to conduct operations to monitor and, if needed, interdict vessels suspected of carrying illegal arms or mercenaries. 

It also said it had finalized plans to help enforce the no-fly zone, but there were no signs of an agreement of the plans being put into operation. 

The 28 allies have been divided over NATO's role in the Libyan operation, with Turkey expressing reservations about its involvement in a no-fly zone and haggling over whether NATO should assume command of the operation from the U.S.
