DETROIT— Nissan Motor Co. plans to shift production of the Rogue sport-utility vehicle to the U.S. from Japan in 2013, in an effort to localize as much as 85% of its manufacturing in the regions where it sells vehicles by 2015.

  Carlos Tavares, head of the Japanese auto maker's Americas region, also said the company will return to the North American International Auto Show in Detroit in 2012 after a three-year hiatus, following  Porsche Automobil Holding SE's return this year as the industry looks to build on its momentum. 

Nissan's Rogue now is built at a plant in Kyushu, Japan. The move to the Smyrna, Tenn., plant will bring yearly production of at least 100,000 of the small SUVs to the U.S., Mr. Tavares said late Sunday in a speech here before the Society of Automotive Analysts.

"There are still significant challenges facing us. One of the biggest—not surprisingly—is the strength of the Japanese yen and the impact it has on our profitability," Mr. Tavares said. 

The yen is trading at 83 for $1, well below the historic level, which makes it unprofitable to export from Japan to the U.S. 

The Smyrna plant also will begin mass production of the Leaf electric car in 2013, with an annual capacity of 150,000. Nissan began selling the Leaf in the U.S. last month. 

Mr. Tavares said Nissan is forecasting global sales of 4.1 million vehicles for the fiscal year that ends in March, for a global market share of 5.8%. 

Global auto sales in 2010 are expected to have 72 million, the most ever, and next year they will be no less than 73 million, Mr. Tavares said.
