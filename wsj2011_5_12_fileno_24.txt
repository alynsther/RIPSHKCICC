MUMBAI â€“ Indian shares dropped in light trade Thursday, as bearish global cues eclipsed a sharper-than-expected increase in factory output for March. 

Markets across Asia and Europe fell sharply as a tumble in commodity prices, coupled with concerns over Greece's debt crisis, dented investors' risk appetite. 

The Bombay Stock Exchange's Sensitive Index fell 249.17 points, or 1.3%, to close at 18335.79. On the National Stock Exchange, the 50-stock S&P CNX Nifty fell 78.90 points, or 1.4%, to end at 5486.15. 

Trading volume on the BSE fell to 25.86 billion rupees ($580 million) from Wednesday's 27.81 billion rupees. Gainers lagged decliners 943 to 1,848, while 133 stocks were unchanged. 

In Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 0.9%, Japan's Nikkei lost 1.5% and China's Shanghai Composite slipped 1.4%. 

Among European markets, Germany's DAX was trading 1.5% lower and France's CAC was down 1.4%. 

The negative sentiment spread to Indian markets and overshadowed an encouraging factory output reading. Government data Thursday showed India's industrial output grew 7.3% in March, much higher than the 3.8% median estimate in a Dow Jones Newswires poll of 16 economists. The pace of growth was also far quicker than the 3.65% increase in February. 

"The industrial data was a positive, but the sell-off in commodities and a weak opening in European markets sent shock waves through our market," said  Alex Mathews, head of research at Geojit BNP Paribas Financial Services. 

Analysts say investors are eyeing election results for five state assemblies due Friday, and a strong showing from the Congress party, which leads the federal coalition, will boost sentiment. 

All but three of the 30 Sensex constituents closed in the red Thursday. 

Metals led losses on the back of sharp price falls in non-ferrous metals. Hindalco Industries slipped 4.7% to 195.30 rupees and  Sterlite Industries ended 4.8% lower at 168.20 rupees. 

Banks fell on concerns the high factory output would prompt India's central bank to further tighten the monetary policy. 

Mortgage lender Housing Development Finance Corp. dipped 2.8% to 647.10 rupees while ICICI Bank closed 1.9% down at 1,055 rupees. 

In other losers, software vendor Tata Consultancy Services fell 2.3% to 1,112.15 rupees and diversified conglomerate Jaiprakash Associates shed 2.3% to 84.90 rupees. 

Among the handful of Sensex gainers, Hindustan Unilever rose 0.5% to 301.40 rupees and Oil & Natural Gas Corp. added 0.6% to 301.95 rupees.
