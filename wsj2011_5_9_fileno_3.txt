WASHINGTON -- The Senate Banking Committee is slated to vote Thursday on the nomination of  Peter Diamond to join the Federal Reserve Board, but his confirmation by the full Senate still remains doubtful. 

President Barack Obama first nominated Mr. Diamond to the post in April 2010. In the meantime, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist in October won a Nobel Prize in economics. 

But Republican opposition to Mr. Diamond hasn't waned. Sen. Richard Shelby (R., Ala.), the top-ranking Republican on the banking panel, continues to lead the fight against the nomination, arguing that Mr. Diamond doesn't have any direct monetary policy experience. Mr. Shelby said last week that the nomination remains "in trouble." 

Senate Republican leaders are deferring to Mr. Shelby on the matter, meaning Mr. Diamond's Fed nomination is almost certain to remain frozen in the Senate as long as the Alabama Republican continues to oppose him. 

Thursday will be the third banking committee vote on Mr. Diamond's nomination. On both prior occasions, Senate Republicans blocked a final vote on the Senate floor. After his nomination wasn't taken up last summer by the Senate, the White House was forced to renominate him. 

The Senate's failure to act on the nomination means that the central bank continues to operate with vacant seats on its seven-member board as it deals with a second round of quantitative easing and faces increased debate about whether interest rates should be raised to counter inflationary pressures from rising fuel and food prices. 

A second vacant seat of the Fed board opened up when Kevin Warsh left in March; the Obama administration hasn't named a nominee for that seat yet.
