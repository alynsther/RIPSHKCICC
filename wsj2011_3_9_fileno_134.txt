For AC Milan, the storied Italian football club, this season's Champions League is starting to look eerily familiar.

For a second consecutive season, Milan placed second behind Real Madrid in the group stage of the tournament. And for the second year in a row, it then suffered a one-goal defeat at home to an English Premier League club in the first game of the two-leg knockout round.

Last season, Milan was beaten by Manchester United at San Siro before crashing out at Old Trafford in the return leg. To avoid a similar outcome 12 months on, the Serie A leader must beat Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday.

The omens don't favor the Italians: Spurs have won all 18 previous matches in European competition after a first-leg road victory, while Milan hasn't overturned a first-leg home deficit in Europe for more than half a century. Oddsmakers aren't convinced eitherâ€”Tottenham is as short as 2/7 to qualify for the next round. Milan is 11/4 to advance.

Tottenham is also favored to win Wednesday's match outright, having won all three home games during the group stage.

Despite a five-point lead at the top of Serie A, Milan has underperformed in Europe so far this season, winning just two of its seven games, so backing the host to win here is advised. Tottenham's Gareth Bale, who missed the first leg through injury, is expected to return and the winger is his team's joint top scorer in Europe with four goals. He's 11/1 with Unibet to score first here.
