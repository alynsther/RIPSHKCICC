New Delhi â€“ India's largest iron-ore producer NMDC Ltd is set to appoint a financial advisor for the purchase of Russia's Kolmar Coal Co. and expects to complete the transaction by May, industry and merchant banking sources said.

NMDC, however, may be forced to square off with several global contenders for the asset as the race to secure raw materials gets tighter.

"The technical due diligence is over," said an unnamed source involved in the deal. "Financial advisors have been shortlisted. In a just a few days, the party will be appointed."

NMDC, which produced 23.8 million tons of iron ore in 2009-10, down from 28.5 million tons in the previous year, is making downstream expansions in keeping with industry trends and as the government looks to impose a profit-sharing law on miners. 

The company is building a 1-million-ton steel plant in the central state of Chhattisgarh, and has signed a memorandum of understanding with Russia's Severstal to build a steel plant in the southern state of Karnataka. 

While iron ore for its steel plants will come from its own mines, NMDC needs to get coking coal from abroad, as local supplies are negligible. Kolmar therefore is an opportunity the company is keen to grab.

When asked to confirm whether the company was in talks with Kolmar and is close to bidding for it, 

NMDC Chairman  Rana Som declined to comment on the deal, but said: "We are trying very hard to get iron-ore and coal mines overseas; we are looking at the U.S., Russia and Australia." 

he Export-Import Bank of India has raised 3 billion rupees by selling short-term debt, said a person familiar with the matter.
