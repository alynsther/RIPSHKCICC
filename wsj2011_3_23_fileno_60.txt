 PLC is still awaiting government approval, the Edinburgh-based explorer said Tuesday. 

"Cairn continues to believe the necessary approvals to complete the Vedanta transaction will be received and is working with the government of India in a positive and constructive manner," said Chief Executive  Bill Gammell in a statement accompanying the group's full-year results. 

The firm had asked India's government to clear the proposed stake by Feb. 20, for Cairn to complete the transaction by April 15. 

Cairn Tuesday reported 2010 full-year net profit of $794.3 million, significantly higher than the $24.7 million posted a year ago.
