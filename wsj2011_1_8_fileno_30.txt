The Devils traded captain Jamie Langenbrunner to the Dallas Stars on Friday for a conditional draft pick, the first major trade this season for the NHL-worst team. Mr. Langenbrunner, 35, has been with New Jersey since 2002 and had 14 points in 31 games this season. He surpassed the 50-point mark five times in his tenure with the Devils and scored 11 goals in 24 playoff games during the team's 2003 Stanley Cup run. He was originally drafted by the Stars and broke into the NHL with them in the 1994-1995 season before he was traded to the Devils during the 2001-2002 season.

Jets cornerback Darrelle Revis, arguably the NFL's best cornerback, is likely to spend Saturday night's AFC wild-card game covering the Colts' top wide receiver, Reggie Wayne. Since Mr. Wayne often faces double coverage, he's actually relishing the chance to line up against just one man. "There is only one way to consider somebody a 'shutdown' type of corner, and that is not to throw to [him]," Mr. Wayne said. "Hopefully, I will get my number called a few times."

St. John's men's basketball team (10-3, 3-0 Big East) will seek to extend its five-game winning streak—and preserve its perfect conference record—Saturday night against No. 14/15-ranked Notre Dame (13-2, 2-1). Tip-off time at Purcell Pavilion is 8 p.m. It will continue a grueling stretch for the Red Storm, as they face the second of eight straight ranked opponents. Overall, St. John's has compiled its best Big East start since 1999-2000. "They're a scrappy, tenacious group," said new St. John's head coach Steve Lavin. "There's a good buzz going."
