TOKYO—Japanese stocks suffered their biggest one-day fall Tuesday since 2008, with the main index sliding 11% as panic selling set in over a broadening nuclear crisis. 

The selling was spread among local and foreign investors alike, and was especially heavy in the futures market. While bargain-buying late in the session helped the Nikkei 225 Average off its lows, and key support at 8000 held, analysts said the mood remains wary. 

"It's panic selling. It's not only foreign investors—everybody just wants to dump shares," said Retela Crea Securities general manager  Yosuke Shimizu. 

The Nikkei closed 1,015.34 points lower at 8605.15, having gone as low as 8227.63 intraday, when it was down more than 14%. It was the lowest close since April 28, 2009, and the biggest single-day percentage loss since the 11.4% fall of Oct. 16, 2008, which came after the failure of Lehman Bros. 

The selling spread into other Asian markets Tuesday: Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index tumbled 2.9%, China's Shanghai Composite lost 1.4%, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 shed 2.1%, Taiwan's Taiex skidded 3.4% and South Korea's Kospi gave up 2.4%.

Two days of heavy falls have wiped 16% off the value of the TSE First Section, taking the market capitalization to 261 trillion yen ($3.2 trillion). 

Tokyo shares fell 6.2% Monday on worries about the aftermath of the magnitude 9.0 quake and the ensuing tsunami that hit Friday. Selling was compounded Tuesday by a worsening emergency at a key nuclear power plant in the country's northeast.

 or Tepco, which owns the troubled reactors at the center of the nuclear drama, closed limit-down for the second-straight session, ending at 1,221 yen, 25% lower. The cost of credit protection against a default or restructuring of Tepco debt more than tripled Tuesday on concerns about the company's outlook. The annual cost of protecting $10 million of Tepco debt for five years soared by $270,000 to $380,000, according to participants in the credit-default-swaps market. 

Meanwhile, the Topix index of all the Tokyo Stock Exchange First Section issues surrendered 80.23 points, or 9.5%, to 766.73, with all 33 subindexes ending deeply in negative territory. Trading volume hit a record for the second straight session, totaling 5.78 billion shares, eclipsing Monday's then-record 4.88 billion share mark. 

Futures trading played an important part in cash market execution. The Nikkei June contract closed down 820 points, or 8.7%, at 8640 on the Osaka Securities Exchange; its sell-off after the midday market close following news of a fire at Tepco's No. 4 reactor at the Fukushima Daiichi plant—amid reports that radiation levels had jumped near the No. 3 reactor—triggered another round of cash market selling once the afternoon session began. 

Senior government officials sought throughout the day to reassure the market, and the Bank of Japan offered to inject another five trillion yen in same-day funds into the money market, but Prime Minister Naoto Kan's comments on radiation caused unease: "Substantial amounts of radiation are leaking in the area," Mr. Kan said on television. "We are making utmost efforts to prevent further explosions or the release of radioactive materials." 

Accelerated selling caused OSE circuit breakers to trip twice, interrupting trading. Topix futures trading was also temporarily halted. 

Weakness was felt across the market.  Sony shares lost 8.9% to 2,324 yen, as it, along with other manufacturers, halted production on some of its operations. 

Real-estate shares dropped on fears the shutdown of nuclear power plants and a prolonged power outage will slow industrial activity in Japan. Mitsubishi Estate fell 12% to 1,335 yen, but not before dropping 27% intraday.

 off 13% at 225 yen. 

Bank stocks fell, with Mizuho Financial Group down 10% at 130 yen. A further drop in equities could mean a serious capital squeeze for Japanese banks, said  Kristine Li, an Asia Pacific credit analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland. "If the Nikkei hits 8000, the banks are going to see a big, big problem" as they sit on losses in equity holdings. 

The Nikkei may fall to 7800 in the days ahead, said  Takuya Yamada, a senior portfolio manager at ITC Investment Partners, though much depends on the nuclear situation, and a rebound also can't be ruled out. 

"The panic has not set in world-wide so there will be Japanese companies able to generate profits on the back of a more favorable global economy," he said. It wouldn't be too surprising to see the index bounce back to 10000 before too long. 

  Nicholas Smith, an independent equity strategist, said investors shouldn't panic over the nuclear headlines. 

"[Radiation] exposure falls very rapidly with distance. In terms of investments, the smart money will be going straight into construction, construction machinery shares, and insurers. Japan stocks were unbelievably cheap before this crisis, and they are even cheaper now," he said.
