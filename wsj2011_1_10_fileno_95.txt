Mexico's violent resort city of Acapulco suffered a new wave of grisly killings as authorities announced the discovery of 15 decapitated bodies, bringing deaths since Friday to 28. 

The corpses were found abandoned on the sidewalk near a shopping mall during the early hours of Saturday morning, according to a statement released by police of Guerrero, the state where Acapulco is located. Investigators soon found the heads of the victims in a pile elsewhere. All of the dead were young men under the age of 30, the statement said.

Such beheadings, while gruesome, are not uncommon in the resort town which was once a popular and safe destination for tourists from around the world. But since a shootout with the Mexican navy that killed Arturo Beltran-Leyva, the alleged leader of a powerful drug cartel, Acapulco has been the epicenter of near constant violence as rival crime groups struggle for control of its key port.

Photographs published by Mexican newspapers showed uniformed men patrolling the crime scene where the remains of a charred car was also found near the decapitated bodies. News reports said a message was found near the bodies that claimed to have been left by members of Mexico's Sinaloa cartel. 

Violence spread in other incidents in the city, including the killings of six people in a taxi.

Officials at the state attorney general's office did not return a call for comment.

The spate of killings marks the biggest incident in the port town since last September, when a busload of 20 Mexican men were kidnapped as they arrived from the nearby state of Michoac√°n. Weeks later 19 of the bodies were discovered in a mass grave.
