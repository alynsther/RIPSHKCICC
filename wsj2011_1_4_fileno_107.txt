Five teams in this year's NFL playoffs had two different players run for more than 500 yards during the regular season. The Indianapolis Colts just wish they could have one.

The Colts' leading rusher this season, Donald Brown, gained just 497 yards on the ground. That makes Indianapolis the first team since 1998 to qualify for the playoffs without a 500-yard runner, and just the 12th team to do it in a 16-game season. The last team to win a Super Bowl without one was also the Colts—but that was in 1970, when they played in Baltimore and had a 14-game schedule. Of the 11 previous teams to make the playoffs in a 16-game season without a 500-yard runner, none won more than one postseason game, and seven of the 11 lost their opener.

It's not that the Colts haven't tried to build a strong running game. They spent a first-round draft pick on Mr. Brown in 2009, and they took Joseph Addai in the first round of the 2006 draft. But both have been limited by injuries this season and often were ineffective when they played. 

Despite their poor rushing attack, the Colts tied an NFL record by making the playoffs for a ninth consecutive year. But if history is any guide, their playoff run will be short.
