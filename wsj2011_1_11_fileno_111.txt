Midway through the European football season, the English Premier League's relegation battle features a familiar mix of the mediocre, the unproven, the banged-up and the downright dismal. 

But two of the principle strugglers will meet on Tuesday in a League Cup semifinal that offers a rare chance of glory for a couple of this season's biggest disappointments.

West Ham, which is bottom of the 20-team top division, welcomes 15th-placed Birmingham City to Upton Park for the first leg of the semifinal, with the return game scheduled for St. Andrew's on Jan. 26.

With the two teams separated by just two points in the standings, these clubs look pretty evenly matched: There was nothing between the pair when they met last November, drawing 2-2 in Birmingham.

Frédéric Piquionne scored the first goal back then and is a decent bet at 6/1 to score first here. West Ham's top scorer with seven goals so far, he has struck the opening goal on three occasions already this season.

Home advantage makes West Ham 5/4 favorite with oddsmakers, with the draw available at 12/5 and Birmingham best-priced at 5/2 with Victor Chandler.

Having gone five seasons without winning a trophy, Arsenal's drought should be ended this year with the club the comfortable favorite to win the League Cup at 4/7.

The Gunners were surprisingly held to a draw in the FA Cup on Saturday by Leeds United, of the second-tier Championship, but bookmakers expect nothing less than a victory in the second of this week's semifinals when Arsenal travels to Ipswich Town, another second-division side, on Wednesday night in their first-leg match. 

Ipswich sacked Roy Keane as manager last week and lost 7-0 against Chelsea in its FA Cup fixture on Sunday. That defeat follows seven losses in nine league games prior to Mr. Keane's departure. Arsenal, which has won 13 games this season in all competitions by two goals or more, looks worth backing here with a -1.5 Asian Handicap on Betfair at 21/20.
