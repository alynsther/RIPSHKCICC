WASHINGTONâ€”The White House is grappling with whether to release a gruesome photograph of Osama bin Laden, weighing the benefit of proving his death with the possibility the image could kindle an anti-American backlash.

Bin Laden was shot in the head in a firefight after U.S. forces stormed the his lair in Pakistan. Bin Laden, unarmed, resisted U.S. forces and was shot and killed, the White House said.

The question the White House is weighing, spokesman  Jay Carney said, is "does it serve or in any way harm our interests?" He said it is "fair to say that it is a gruesome photograph."

Mr. Carney wouldn't say who has seen the photograph or where it is. 

The U.S. government said it has photos of bin Laden's body being buried at sea as well as photos of his body taken after the raid.

In the absence of proof, conspiracy theories have flourished, especially in Pakistan and Afghanistan, asserting bin Laden remains alive.

Central Intelligence Agency Director Leon Panetta told NBC in an interview Tuesday that the U.S. will eventually present a photograph.

"The government obviously has been talking about how best to do this, but I don't think there was any question that ultimately a photograph would be presented to the public," he said, according to a transcript.

Some are urging the White House to release the photos.

"I think that this is being very carefully considered," said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D., Calif.), who heads the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. "I think for purposes of 100% identification there is value in doing so."
