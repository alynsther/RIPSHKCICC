MUMBAI â€“ National carrier Air India Wednesday continued to follow a contingency plan of operating 106 domestic flights out of 320, as a group of almost 750 pilots agitating over pay boycotted work for the eighth straight day. 

"This is a contingency plan we have worked out till May 6," a spokesman at the carrier said. The airline's overseas flights haven't been disrupted. 

The strike was called last Wednesday by pilots of the former Indian Airlines, which was merged with Air India in August 2007. It has forced the carrier to cancel most local flights and incur millions of rupees in lost revenue. 

Almost four years after the formal merger, several Indian Airlines employees continue to work on pre-merger pay scales, which are in some cases lower than their counterparts in Air India. This has led to several industrial actions in the past few years, disrupting operations and leading to losses for the already troubled carrier. 

Air India has maintained that the ongoing strike by the Indian Commercial Pilots' Association is illegal due to an earlier assurance by the union to the Delhi High Court that it wouldn't go on strike. 

The airline has said that no strike is legally permitted as a case is pending before a tribunal set up to look into issues such as pay parity and to make recommendations on different productivity-linked incentive schemes. 

The court Tuesday issued contempt notices to nine top members of the union, asking them to reply in 15 days. Meanwhile, Air India has told striking pilots they will not be paid their wages for April unless they return to work. 

The carrier has, however, assured the court it may take back the striking pilots it has sacked if the strike is called off. Air India earlier said it sacked seven pilots and suspended four more.
