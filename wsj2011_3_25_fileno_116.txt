LIMAâ€”Presidential candidate  Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, rising in opinion polls before the April 10 elections, reiterated that he is a Peruvian by birth and will give up his U.S. citizenship if elected. 

Political opponents are criticizing Mr. Kuczynski for having double nationality, saying it makes him unfit to hold Peru's highest political office. 

The former investment banker and prime minister was born in Peru in 1938. 

"If I am president I have always said that the only passport I will have is the one where I was born," Mr. Kuczynski told reporters Friday. 

Having double nationality is a sensitive issue in Peru following former President  Alberto Fujimori's flight into exile in Japan in 2000, where he avoided extradition by holding Japanese citizenship. 

Mr. Kuczynski has jumped to third place in voter intentions, with 17.5% support, up from 4.2% in January, a national survey by pollster Datum Internacional said. 

Former President  Alejandro Toledo remains in first place in voter intentions with 19.4% support, followed by nationalist leader Ollanta Humala in second place at 17.6%. 

If no candidate wins a first-round majority then a run-off vote will take place later.
