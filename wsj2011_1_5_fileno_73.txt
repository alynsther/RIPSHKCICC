NEW YORKâ€”Blue-chip stocks tacked on a second straight session of gains this year, boosted by encouraging economic data and relief over a quiet set of minutes from the Federal Reserve's last meeting. 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 20.43 points, or 0.2%, to 11691.1, extending the gains from its surge on Monday, the first trading session of the year.

Other benchmark indexes closed with modest losses. The Nasdaq Composite fell 10.27, or 0.4% to 2681.25. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index shed 1.69, or 0.1%, to 1270.20.

 saying the fiscal year 2011 consensus could be too high given the challenging environment. Supervalu tumbled 6.4%, while Kroger lost 1.4%.

 rose 2.3% after its U.S. light-vehicle sales climbed 8% in December thanks to continued strong demand for crossovers and pickups. GM on Tuesday also forecast that U.S. auto sales industrywide will reach 13 million to 13.5 million in 2011 as economic growth picks up and unemployment declines.

Traders said the market felt some relief that the minutes of the Fed's policy-making committee's Dec. 14 meeting contained no major surprises.

In the minutes, the central bank said a stronger U.S. economy is among the reasons behind the rise in government-bond yields, which may undermine its efforts to keep the recovery going via low interest rates. In November 2010, the Fed announced a $600 billion bond-purchase program, known as "quantitative easing," or "QE2." Despite the improvement in the economy, Fed officials "generally felt that the change in the outlook was not sufficient to warrant any adjustments to the asset-purchase program," the minutes showed.

Market strategists were encouraged to see the Fed echo what many have characterized as a gradually recovering economy, and relieved to see no major changes to the quantitative-easing program, said  Bill Vaughn, portfolio manager at Evercore Wealth Management.

Investors "certainly would have been worried if there had been a sudden change in policy," he said.

Tuesday's key data point was encouraging. The Commerce Department reported that U.S. factory-goods orders unexpectedly rose 0.7% in November, when economists had been predicting a 0.1% decline. 

Still, stocks beyond the Dow couldn't shake off mild losses as investors took a breather after the market's recent surge.

The market had "a really nice run in December, and I think a lot of that is playing a part in what's going on today," said  Tom Villalta, lead portfolio manager at Jones/Villalta Opportunity Fund. The Fed's view that the economy is gradually strengthening presented few surprises, he said. "There's nothing in there that we found particularly shocking." 

Crude-oil prices dropped more than 2% to settle just above $89 a barrel, while gold futures advanced.

The dollar strengthened against both the yen and the euro. The U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the currency against a basket of others, rose 0.4%.
