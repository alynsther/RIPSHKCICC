Sen. Dick Durbin, a member of President Barack Obama's deficit-reduction commission, said federal lawmakers should wait until the U.S. is clearly out of recession before making significant spending cuts to reduce the deficit.

In a speech Friday morning at the Union League Club in Chicago, Mr. Durbin (D., Ill.) also said he is begging Republican legislators not to use "the debt ceiling as a bargaining chip."

Some lawmakers have threatened to refuse to increase the amount of debt the U.S. may hold, as a way of forcing steeper spending cuts through Congress. The debt ceiling must be raised by March 31. Hitting the debt ceiling would leave the U.S. unable to borrow money to pay interest on what it already owes investors or to fund new spending. 

If China or other creditors lose faith in the U.S. dollar, "it could be devastating," Mr. Durbin said. "I think it's a doomsday scenario."

The senator was one of 11 of the 18 members of Mr. Obama's National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility who voted in early December in favor of a package of spending cuts and tax changes to reduce the deficit. The proposals include raising the retirement age for Social Security benefits and tightening income-tax deductions while lowering tax rates.

While he described the deficit as a serious problem, Congress needs to consider "whether or not we're hitting the deficit brake too soon," Mr. Durbin said.

The deficit commission's proposals don't suggest major spending cuts until 2013.

Mr. Durbin pointed to the experience of the Great Depression, when Congress attacked the deficit before the economy had fully recovered, driving the unemployment rate back up, he said. 

"If we don't get out of this recession, we are not ever going to be able to have serious deficit reduction," he said.
