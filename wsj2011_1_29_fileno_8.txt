DAVOS, Switzerland -- The finance ministers of France and Germany Saturday pledged a comprehensive solution to address the euro zone's institutional problems. 

In a panel discussion, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said the euro zone will "draw the consequences" from the crisis of the last 18 months and "create instruments to defend the whole euro zone."



Mr. Schaeuble said these measures will be enough to avert another major shock in the currency bloc, a view indirectly endorsed by  Barclays

 PLC Chief Executive  Bob Diamond, who said that "the big fear that the euro zone might not stick together, that's off the table now." 

Mr. Diamond said the euro zone's problems have mutated from "acute" in 2010 to "chronic", this year. 

For her part, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde said the euro zone has "turned a corner" and stressed that every one of its 17 member states is now reducing its budget deficit. 

She added that France and Germany have "learned from our mistake" in 2005, when they blocked European Commission attempts to fine them for running excessive budget deficits, in violation of the Stability and Growth Pact. The episode is seen as having set a fateful precedent for the euro zone, signaling a lack of will to stick to its official self-imposed rules, and encouraging countries such as Greece to flout them. 

Euro-zone governments are aiming to complete a comprehensive package of measures aimed at preventing a rerun of the current crisis at a meeting of heads of government in late March. 

Among the many ideas being discussed are a permanent mechanism for addressing sovereign-debt problems, that includes restructuring as a last resort. In addition, there are proposals for homogenizing economic and social policy, in an attempt to eradicate divergences in competitiveness.
