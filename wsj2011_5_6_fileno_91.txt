The exhibit "About Face: Portraiture as Subject" at the Blanton Museum of Art at the University of Texas at Austin explores the thread that ties together a roman imperial bust, a Baroque period painting and a contemporary video portrait.

An Andy Warhol portrait of Farrah Fawcett joins work by Rembrandt, John Singer Sargent and Chuck Close in "About Face: Portraiture as Subject" at the Blanton Museum of Art at the University of Texas at Austin. The exhibit, which runs through Sept. 4, explores the thread that ties together a Roman imperial bust, a Baroque period painting and a contemporary video portrait. "Our fascination with faces is almost a hard-wired human characteristic," said exhibit curator Annette DiMeo Carlozzi. "We continue to be fascinated with how we represent ourselves to the world."
