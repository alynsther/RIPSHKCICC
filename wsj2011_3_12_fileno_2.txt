  Google Inc. granted $8.9 million in bonuses and $50 million in equity to four senior executives for 2010, but the Web giant's co-founders and its chief executive didn't receive additional compensation. 

In a regulatory filing Friday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Google said Chief Financial Officer  Patrick Pichette received a $2.7 million bonus and equity valued at $15 million under the company's executive bonus plan in recognition of his contributions to Google's financial performance last year. 

Chief Business Officer  Nikesh Arora received a $2.7 million bonus and an equity grant of $20 million, while  Alan Eustace, senior vice president of engineering and research, got a $1.8 million bonus and equity valued at $10 million.  Jonathan Rosenberg, senior vice president of product management, received a $1.7 million bonus and equity valued at $5 million. 

CEO  Eric Schmidt as well as co-founders  Larry Page and  Sergei Brin weren't awarded bonuses or equity awards under the executive bonus plan. 

In January, Mr. Schmidt was awarded $100 million in stock and stock options after the company announced he would hand over the CEO reins to Mr. Page and move to the newly created position of executive chairman. 

Google last year saw its profit jump more than 30% to $8.5 billion as revenue jumped 24% to $29.3 billion. Google shares fell about 4% last year.
