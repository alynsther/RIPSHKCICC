The Makery, a technology start-up space in Williamsburg, played host to a celebrity-trivia party this week, drawing a crowd of young, new-media types out to prove they know as much about pop culture as they do about computer programming.

Formerly the office space for Hot Potato, a start-up for "checking in" to locations that reportedly sold to Facebook for $10 million in cash in August, the Makery is run by tech guru  Matt Langer. 

The wide-open office on North 11th Street has become known both for its ambitious inhabitants and as a venue for parties.

  Lauren Leto, the 24-year-old founder of Texts From Last Night and her business partner  Patrick Moberg, with whom she recently founded the social network BNTER, hosted the competition. 

There were three rounds of the game, Who-Said-It-On-Twitter: Lindsay Lohan or Paris Hilton; Charlie Sheen or Gary Busey; and 50 Cent or Kanye West.

The Makery's party guests took the game pretty seriously.

"If you work on the Internet, you need to have a basic understanding of celebrity culture," said  Caldwell Tanner, a 24-year-old illustrator for CollegeHumor.com. 

"Celebrities become memes, and tech people pay attention to memes," added  Lindsey Weber, who works at the Barbarian Group. "If you have a Tumblr, you're going to hear about Willow Smith."

At the end of the night, Team Discovery Channel— Pat Nakajima from the start-up GroupMe and  Ashley Cardiff from the fashion and beauty website, the Gloss—were victorious. 

"They were just fast buzzers," said  Bianca Caampued, the 26-year-old co-founder of the social media and publicity agency Small Girls.

"And now they'll just compare me to the kids they used to play Mortal Kombat with that blamed losing on their controllers," she said.
