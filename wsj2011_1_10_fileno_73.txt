With its whimsical storybook setting, Alice's Tea Cup is perfect for a mother-daughter lunch, a book-club meeting or the bridal shower before the fairy-tale wedding. 

There's no pretension at play here. This is a perfect spot for those seeking lunch in a playful setting. (Men are welcome.)

Menu offerings are more filling than you might expect. Sandwiches are served with mixed greens and include smoked salmon with lemon-dill butter ($12), a grilled veggie ($12) and a BLT with stilton spread on toasted black bread ($10). The Lapsang Souchong smoked chicken breast on mixed greens ($14) is a perfect salad selection.

Combinations designed for one or two people are the best bets. "The Mad Hatter" comes with a pot of tea, two scones (pumpkin are best-sellers), two sandwiches, and a dessert for $30 or $37. There's baby food and a kids' menu for the small set.

The flagship, which opened in 2001, instantly became known for its scones and celebrity fans. Two more uptown restaurants later, lines are still common. Kill time in the gift shop, where wings, fairy dust and of course, teas are sold.

 With more than 100 flavors on the menu, selecting just one could take some time. 

 Alice's Tea Cup, 102 W. 73rd Street at Columbus. Lunch is served 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily; 212-799-3006.
