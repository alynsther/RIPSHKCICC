BRUSSELSâ€”European Union governments Tuesday agreed on a broad economic-policy overhaul, but European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet said the changes didn't go far enough. 

The governments agreed on six pieces of legislation aimed at improving national budget-making policies, toughening sanctions for euro-zone countries that don't follow EU budget rules and creating a system for preventing macroeconomic imbalances that are at the heart of the euro zone's current problems. 

The European Parliament must also approve the proposals before they can become law. 

Mr. Trichet said the changes aren't ambitious enough. "We continue to think that the improvement in governance that is presently envisioned is, in our opinion, insufficient to draw the lessons from the crisis we had to cope with," he said. 

Several ministers said the rules may need to be revisited to give national governments more fiscal flexibility, once the rules have helped reduce debt levels. 

"In about five years, we should be much safer and then we'll have to come back to that issue," said Polish Finance Minister Jan Rostowski.
