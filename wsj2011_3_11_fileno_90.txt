 Playwright Rajiv Joseph recently had the kind of anxiety dream reserved for people making their Broadway debuts. In it, he discovered his play, "Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo," was assistant-directed by Julie Taymor, the recently sidelined director of the trouble-plagued "Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark."

"This is actually a tame one," he said of the dream. 

Mr. Joseph is under some pressure himself. His dark comedy, set in the first U.S. invasion of Iraq, starts previews Friday. The 36-year-old Ohioan, also a writer for Showtime's "Nurse Jackie," has written eight plays, including "Gruesome Playground Injuries." The Broadway production of "Bengal Tiger" came together last fall, about six months after that play was named a finalist for the 2010 Pulitzer Prize.

The play opens with a U.S. soldier killing a tiger at a zoo in Iraq. Robin Williams, in his Broadway acting debut, plays the surreal character of the tiger. In the afterlife, the tiger's soul fills with knowledge of the universe, and he sees the nature of cruelty in new ways. 

The tiger's lines are mostly delivered directly, a bit like stand-up. In the play's rehearsal room the other day, Mr. Williams briefly broke character, speaking to a crowd he imagined in the front row. "Now that I'm dead, Mrs. Mellman, I'm having all sorts of revelations," he said, tweaking the line. Mr. Joseph laughed. As Mr. Williams returned to the speech, the playwright mouthed the words along with him.

The play, directed on Broadway by Moisés Kaufman, had two successful runs in the Los Angeles area. The idea for the story arose eight years ago, when Mr. Joseph saw an article about an American soldier in Iraq who had allegedly shot to death a tiger in a zoo.

Mr. Joseph had a long fascination with tigers. As a kid, he owned a beloved stuffed tiger, but he was a little less into metaphor then.

"He had a really interesting name," he said of the toy. "It was 'Tiger.'"
