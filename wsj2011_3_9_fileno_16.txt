BANGALORE â€“ India's Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. Wednesday said it remains a creditor to Iceland's Kaupthing Bank Hf, which went bankrupt in 2008 while the software exporter was offering some technology outsourcing services. 

The Reykjavik-based lender filed for bankruptcy protection in the U.S. in early 2009 as the global economic crisis deepened. At the peak of the credit boom, Kaupthing was one among the three major banks in Iceland to grow to almost 10 times the size of the economy. But the expansion collapsed amid the financial crisis as foreign investors dumped Icelandic assets. 

"We continue to be a party to the credit recovery process [of Kaupthing] and look forward to a settlement of the issue," TCS, India's largest software exporter by sales, said in a statement. 

The company said its exposure to the banking sector in Iceland "isn't significant." 

Wednesday, local newspaper Mint, citing a list provided to the federal government by Iceland authorities, said that about 70 Indian companies, including TCS, are creditors to Kaupthing. 

The newspaper said the Indian software exporter's exposure to the bank is worth $18,641.22. But TCS declined to comment on the amount that Kaupthing owes to the company.
