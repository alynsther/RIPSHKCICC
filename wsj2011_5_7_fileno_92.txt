Cataclysm: The First World War as Political Tragedy by David Stevenson (2004) A comprehensive take on why the war began, why it continued and what it meant for the 20th century. Setting operations and strategy in context, it reflects the work of a long scholarly career.



The Marne, 1914: The Opening of World War I and the Battle that Changed the Worldby Holger Herwig (2009) Why didn't the war end by Christmas 1914? This vivid account of the opening campaign in the West highlights the way firepower increased the lethality of combat and made decisive victory illusory. These battles set the pattern for the fighting and raised the stakes of the war.



Gallipoli: The End of the Myth  by Robin Prior (2009) The definitive account of the ill-conceived attempt to shorten the war by opening a sea rout to Russia through the Mediterranean. Bitter fighting on the Gallipoli peninsula reprised the deadlock on the Western Front as British, Australian and New Zealand troops sought to break well-defended Turkish lines.



A Peace to End All Peaceby David Fromkin (1989) We largely view World War I through the struggles on the Western Front, and Mr. Fromkin filled a major gap by showing how it created the political landscape, from the Balkans to India, with which we struggle today. 



Brest-Litovsk: The Forgotten Peace, March 1918by John Wheeler-Bennett (1938) The classic account of a generally neglected story: the negotiations after Germany's victory on the Eastern Front. Russia's collapse gave the central powers a last hope for winning the war.
