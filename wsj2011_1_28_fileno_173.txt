FRANKFURT—Euro-zone bank lending expanded further in December, but the flow of loans to businesses turned negative again, raising doubt about companies' ability and willingness to raise capital expenditure. 

The euro zone's recovery from the deep recession that followed the global financial crisis has been hindered by weak bank lending, particularly to businesses. Private-sector lending increased 1.9% in December from the same month a year earlier, after rising 2% in November, data from the European Central Bank showed Friday. 

But recent timid improvements in lending to businesses stalled in December, the data showed. Lending to nonfinancial firms fell €24 billion ($32.97 billion), after rising by a revised €8 billion in November. 

Loans to businesess decreased by an annual rate of 0.2% in December, after falling 0.1% in November. Bank lending to households remained robust, as the annual rate of loans growth increased to 3% in December from 2.8% the previous month. 

The annual growth rate of M3 money slowed unexpectedly, to 1.7% in December from an upwardly revised 2.1% in November, the data showed. 

The outcome was below economists' forecasts of a 2% increase, indicating that there is little risk that broad money growth will drive up inflation in the euro zone. M3 comprises currency in circulation, overnight, short-term deposits and debt securities of up to two years, repurchase agreements and money market fund shares. 

The three-month moving average of the annual rate of change of M3 rose to 1.6% in the October-December period, from 1.4% in the preceding period. That is below the ECB's 4.5% growth reference value for the three-month average, which it considers to be in line with maintaining price stability, or an inflation rate of just below 2% over the medium term.
