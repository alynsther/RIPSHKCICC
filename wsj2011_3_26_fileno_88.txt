'I'm a little embarrassed by this auction, to tell the truth," said decorator Albert Hadley with characteristic modesty. "It's not like it's Bill Blass—it's just a mixture, nothing grand."

Mr. Hadley's mixtures, no matter what composition, are the stuff of design legend. When he closed his office last year, a small number of furniture pieces and objects from his days working with decorating partner Sister Parish were kept in storage. Mr. Hadley, eyes always ahead, has decided that now it is time for that to go. Included in Sotheby's European furniture sale of March 30 and 31 are 38 lots from the inventory of the greatest American decorating office of our time. 

There are some very personal things, like a trompe l'oeil painted curtain valance. "That was done for the stair hall of my parents' house in Nashville by an artist called York Kennedy," Mr. Hadley recalled. There was once a pair of them, and while he doesn't remember where the pendant ended up, given the history of his firm it could have been Babe Paley's Kiluna Farm, the Kennedy White House or just about anywhere else you might have dreamed to see. Have a go at lot 675 for $200-$300. 

Then there are the prototype pieces made for famous Parish-Hadley projects that spawned a multitude of imitations and descendants, making them look familiar to us now (see lot 670, four Swedish Moderne-style wood benches). But these pieces were in the front lines of American design, which for a generation looked to Parish-Hadley to lead the way. 

Mr. Hadley and Sister Parish were never furniture snobs—with the best taste in the world, they didn't need to be. Prices in this sale will be attractive, the furniture pretty and usable and the moment, a piece of history. Sothebys.com
