ESPN drew a record audience for "The Fab Five," a documentary about the famed quintet of basketball stars at the University of Michigan in the early 1990s. The film, which aired last Sunday night, drew a 2.1 rating, according to the Nielsen Co. 

But the documentary has taken on a life of its own in the last week because of comments in the film about Duke University, the school that beat Michigan in the 1992 NCAA tournament final.

  Jalen Rose, a member of the Fab Five and an executive producer of the documentary, said he believed as a teenager that Duke only courted black players he considered "Uncle Toms" and that Duke "didn't recruit players like me." 

A player on Duke's 1992 team,  Grant Hill, responded to Mr. Rose's comments in the New York Times last week. "I caution my fabulous five friends to avoid stereotyping me and others they do not know in much the same way so many people stereotyped them back then for their appearance and swagger," he wrote.

 Mr. Rose responded on the Journal's website Sunday before Michigan lost in the NCAA tournament to Duke. 

"It's a bit disappointing some people insinuated I think black people from successful families are Uncle Toms," Mr. Rose wrote. "At the end of the day, some people will have their own opinions about the Fab Five and who we are as people. I am proud of what we achieved together from 1991-1993 and even more proud of the men we have become and how we all work in the community."
