New Delhi --JDS Apparels Pvt. Ltd, which owns a chain of department stores known until recently as Ritu Wears, plans to raise 500 million rupees by selling shares to private-equity funds and to add as many as five stores this year. 

The company, currently, runs 12 department stores now called Biglife after a rebranding exercise in October last year, although the old name still is in use. 

It wants to open new "large" format stores in cities such as Agra, Panipat, Meerut, Moradabad, Bareilly, Dehradun and Jaipur in the next year. All the stores will be of 30,000 square feet or more. 

Since JDS has multiple brands, it can only tap domestic investors such as Reliance Capital Ltd, Aditya Birla Capital Advisors Pvt. Ltd and Kotak Private Equity Group to raise funds. The government does not allow foreign investment in multi-brand retail. 

"JDS' growth has been slow and steady," said  Puneet Singh Kochar, director at  Motilal Oswal's investment banking business, which has the mandate for the fund raising. "They haven't leveraged their balance sheet, which is probably their biggest strength." 

The company posted a profit of 75 million rupees and sales of 1.9 billion rupees for the year ended March 31, an increase of 70% and 30%, respectively.

JDS, which has grown at a rate of 25% to 30%, expects to use most of the proceeds of its fund-raising exercise towards its expansion. Kochar expects it to cost nearly 110 million rupees to do the interiors and stock the new stores, and another chunk would go toward rent, advance and deposit.

The business was begun in 1961 in Delhi by  Janak Dulari Sahni, who was joined by sons Sanjay and Sameer. 

But finding willing investors may not be that easy.

"An investor might have a hard time finding an exitâ€”and reaching scale for an exit in the capital markets; it would be difficult to reach scale as this is a tough area to invest in," said  Ajay Relan, managing partner at CX Partners, a New Delhi-based private equity fund.
