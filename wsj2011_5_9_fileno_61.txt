The San Francisco Giants weren't all about their stellar pitching during last year's World Series run. They also hit home runs at a much faster-than-normal pace down the stretch. So far this year, they're back to where they're supposed to be.

Manager Bruce Bochy said last week that his team's offense isn't clicking yet. But last year's September and October—when the team went 31-14 en route to a championship—was the aberration. Eight of the 11 Giants with the most at-bats during that stretch hit home runs far more often than usual. Cody Ross's home-run rate dropped to one every 13.6 at bats from one every 24.2 for his career. Edgar Renteria, now of the Reds, saw his rate drop to 25.6 from 58.5. Juan Uribe, who's now a Dodger, went to a home run every 15.8 at bats from one every 29.

As a team, the Giants hit 1.17 homers a game down the stretch compared with 0.92 for the first 132 games, a pace that would have made them the top home-run club in the National League and third overall had they kept it up for the whole season.

This year, injuries to Ross and Andres Torres have hurt—Ross just hit his first home run on Sunday—but otherwise the bats are largely back to normal, and some are even better. Buster Posey is hitting a home run every 28 at bats compared with 24.2 for his young career. Pablo Sandoval's rate has actually dropped to one every 16.6 at bats from one every 31.2 for the previous three seasons.

As a team, the Giants are hitting 0.79 homer per game, which is below the April-to-August pace last season.

Here's a look at how some Giants' career at bats per home run compare with late last season or so far in 2011.
