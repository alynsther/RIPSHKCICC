Battle-tested in a city where parking is hard to find, San Francisco drivers seem to have become more vigilant about avoiding tickets as citation fees rise. The struggling economy, which has made consumers more wary of pricey tickets, might be playing a role. The city is on track to issue fewer tickets for fiscal 2011, which ends June 30, than it did in fiscal 2010, when 1.7 million citations were given out to yield about $95.7 million, according to the Municipal Transportation Agency. That figure, in turn, was lower than the 1.8 million tickets written in 2009. The declines correspond with several increases in fine levels—an August 2008 rise of $10 for citations under $100, followed by jumps of $3 and $2 for all tickets in July 2009 and July 2010.
