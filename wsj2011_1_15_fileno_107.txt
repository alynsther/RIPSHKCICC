For Sunday's ceremony, hosted by the comedian  Ricky Gervais, this year's  Miss Golden Globe is  Gia Mantegna, the 20-year-old, New York-born daughter of actor  Joe Mantegna ("Criminal Minds.") She also stars on the Teen Nick show "Gigantic." Previous Miss Golden Globes have included the offspring of Whoopi Goldberg, Kevin Costner and Clint Eastwood.

 What are your responsibilities as Miss Golden Globe? 

I like to say I'm a mini silent host. I help escort the winners from the podium to their next destination, which is the press room. I hand the actual Golden Globes to the actual presenters to give to the winners. They're quite heavy, but I don't know how heavy. It's a big beautiful solid globe, a big slab of marble.

 Is there anyone you hope wins? 

I'm rooting for  Claire Danes in "Temple Grandin." I have a sister with autism and I think Claire did a phenomenal job. I'd love to run into Claire and tell her how great she was in that movie.

 What about in the motion picture category? 

Oh my goodness, I'm awful, I haven't seen so many of them. A lot of people have seen "Black Swan" and terrified me out of seeing it. I loved "The Social Network" and "127 Hours." It's definitely not my job to make any predictions.

 Has anybody given you any advice? 

I know a former Miss Golden Globe and a Mr. Golden Globe, but I haven't asked them for any advice. I'll be on stage for three hours, which is a really long time. People say, "Don't trip or fall asleep," and "I hope you're not bored out of your mind." How could I be bored? It's going to be a great show.
