Despite the Mets' foibles on the field and with their finances, there remains an understandable expectation that they should be challenging for the National League Eastern Division title. After all, they are in the largest media market in Major League Baseball, which in turn has allowed them to maintain one of the sport's highest payrolls.

But since the end of the 2008 season, only one lengthy stretch of play has given the team's fans cause for hope. For five weeks last year, May 22 through June 27, the Mets were actually an elite baseball team. They went 23-9—a stark period of excellence amid more than two seasons' worth of ineptitude. Their winning percentage over that time was .719, which if maintained over a 162-game season would result in 116 victories, which is the highest total in major-league history.

Remove that blessed 32-game run from the calculation, though, and the Mets' winning percentage from the start of the 2009 season through their 4-2 loss to the Dodgers on Sunday plummets to .433. That mark would make the Mets the fourth-worst team in the National League since Opening Day '09.

It's not outlandish to say that those 32 games stand as the lone reason for anyone to take the Mets seriously as a competitive franchise. So what happened over those five weeks that was so different from the rest of the Mets' recent history? Here's what:

Pelfrey forever seems to be on the cusp of becoming the top-of-the-rotation starter that the Mets need him to be (especially now that Johan Santana's season and future are in doubt because of his shoulder problems). Yet something always seems to get in his way, whether it's Pelfrey's own insecurities or the stomach virus that shaved 15 pounds off him this season.

But over the seven starts he made during that 23-9 stretch, Pelfrey went 5-1 with a 2.39 earned-run average and held opposing hitters to a .233 batting average and an anemic .611 on-base-plus-slugging percentage. More, he won the two games that bookended the run, beating the Yankees, 5-3, on May 22 and the Minnesota Twins, 5-2, on June 27. Those were important victories against two American League playoff teams. The first kick-started a five-game winning streak; the second lifted the Mets' record to 43-32, a season-best 11 games over .500.

To say that most major-league hitters were unfamiliar with Jon Niese and R.A. Dickey before the two became integral parts of the Mets' rotation last May would be an understatement. 

Niese had made only 11 major-league starts before heading to the disabled list with a hamstring injury, and Dickey had been toiling at Triple-A Buffalo while the Mets spent a month confirming that John Maine and Oliver Perez were incapable of helping them win games.

Niese and Dickey were an immediate and significant upgrade over Maine and Perez, going 10-0 and allowing 67 hits in 74 innings. The pair earned three of the Mets' six wins in consecutive series sweeps over the Baltimore Orioles and Cleveland Indians, neither of whom won more than 69 games last season. The problem for the Mets is that Dickey and Niese haven't been quite so good since.

The numbers that Wright put up over those 32 games—a 1.015 OPS, 13 doubles, six home runs, a .355 batting average—are those of a great player. They also speak to Wright's streakiness, and there have been enough valleys in his production lately that it's fair to wonder if his reputation fits him anymore, if he's merely a very good player and not the franchise cornerstone that the Mets consider him to be. 

In his first 34 games in 2011, he hit .240 with a .767 OPS. In 2009, he managed just 10 home runs, and his strikeout rate has surged since the Mets' move to Citi Field.

Carlos Beltran's renaissance has been perhaps the most pleasant surprise of 2011, but the benefits of having Beltran healthy and hitting have been offset by Pagan's regression and his recent absence because of an oblique strain. He had 13 extra-base hits and a .339 batting average in 113 at-bats over the 32 games last season but is hitting .159 with three extra-base hits in 82 at-bats this season.

Here were the aggregate statistics of Pelfrey, Dickey and Niese during the 23-9 month of 2010: 15-1, 2.41 ERA, 1.15 walks-and-hits-per-innings-pitched. Sunday's loss marked the Mets' 34th game of this season and dropped their record to 15-19. Here were the trio's statistics through that game: 4-11, 5.02 ERA, 1.57 WHIP. Sometimes pinpointing problems is that simple.
