WARSAWâ€”Polish President Bronislaw Komorowski refused to sign a piece of legislation that envisaged cuts in the public administration's head count, rejecting a bill authored by the government of his former political patron.

The bill was supposed to slash the number of employees working in the public administration by up to 8.8% from an estimated 313,350 in 2010. Savings on various levels of the administration were expected to total 4.63 billion zlotys ($1.59 billion) in 2011-2014, according to notes the government sent to parliament with the draft bill.

Poland's public debt has been growing under the government of Prime Minister Donald Tusk and threatens to breach a vital domestic threshold of 55% of gross domestic product, which would trigger radical measures to balance the budget.

On Friday, Mr. Komorowski sent the bill to the Constitutional Tribunal, the country's highest court ruling on legislation's compliance with the constitution. The president said the government's bill would take away the rights employees in the public administration had acquired before the legislation was passed by parliament in December last year.

The Constitutional Tribunal's rulings on legislation are final. A date of hearings on the bill hasn't been set.

It was Mr. Komorowski's first rejection of a bill authored by the government of Prime Minister Donald Tusk, whose Civic Platform party proposed Mr. Komorowski for president in 2010.

The government often said that the previous president, Lech Kaczynski, who died in a plane crash in April 2010, had vetoed legislation, making it difficult for parliamentary majority to govern the country.
