Unemployment rates for railroad conductors, logging workers and metalworkers fell sharply—seven percentage points or more—in 2010 while jobless rates among construction laborers and roofers rose, according to new data from the Labor Department.

Unemployment among telemarketers jumped more than 10 percentage points to nearly 35%; the jobless rate among parking-lot attendants rose to 13.3% in 2010 from 9% in 2009.

The Labor Dept. tracks employment levels by surveying 60,000 households nationwide monthly. For 2010, the Labor Dept. tracked employment for a range of more than 500 occupations, including travel agents (11% unemployed) and taxi drivers (10.7%). (See the data.)



Occupations with an increase in employment included some manufacturing and logistics occupations, such as machinist and transportation-worker supervisors. Metalworkers and tool-and-die makers saw their jobless rate drop more than four percentage points in 2010 from the previous year. The unemployment rate for production occupations—a category that includes an array of jobs from butcher and baker to metal fabricator and machinist—dropped 1.6 percentage points to 13.1%.

"Production is regularly among the hardest hit during recessions but is very flexible and able to respond quickly to a pick up in demand," said Julie Hotchkiss, an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.

Also doing better: railroad conductors and yardmasters. Both saw unemployment rates drop dramatically to 4.6% from 16.4% between 2009 and 2010. The jobless rate of locomotive engineers and operators dropped 2.1 percentage points to 0.4%. As railroad companies saw increasing shipments last year, many brought back train crews that had been temporarily laid off during the recession.

Between late 2009 and the first half of 2010, BNSF Railway Co. recalled more than 3,000 employees that it had put on temporary furlough between late 2008 and early 2009, said spokesman  Steve Forsberg for the Fort Worth, Texas, company.

"Traffic volumes are still significantly below where they were four years ago, but we've still been able to bring nearly everyone back," Mr. Forsberg said.

Mid-Atlantic Precast LLC, which makes construction products, has added 15 workers to its production facility since November, bringing its total employment to about 30. But even though the company's customer backlog has increased, the company still isn't planning to hire more than that soon, said president  David Stone.

"We're not yet confident in how long this growth will last," he said.
