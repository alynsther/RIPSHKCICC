"If someone were to ask me to define collaboration," the French pianist Lucienne Delforge reflected, "I would say: 'It is Mozart in Paris.' " The British music historian Erik Levi clearly agrees. His aim, in "Mozart and the Nazis," is to document how the Nazis used the genial cosmopolitan spirit of Mozart for their own imperial purpose, as a signal of the grandeur of Germanic accomplishment. The high point of the manipulative effort was reached in 1941, the 150th anniversary of the Austrian composer's death. Events celebrating his life and music were organized in all of Nazi- controlled Europe, including France. In a year when war spread across the Continent, the number of Mozart festivals and the legions of musicians involved now seem positively staggering. Even the small Silesian town of Liegnitz, with a population of only 80,000, presented four operatic and four orchestral programs, plus the "Requiem," over nine days. The celebration culminated in Vienna in December, when 67 events were held in one week. But the upshot of the entire effort was the reverse of what the Nazi politicos intended. 

 Instead of acknowledging Mozart's Germanness, audiences reveled in his incomparable music precisely because it spoke less a German than an international language. Mr. Levi shows Italians claiming the composer as their own and Mozart specialists driven from Germany for racial reasons —what he calls "the Mozart diaspora" —engineering the spectacularly successful Glyndebourne festival in England. "Mozart and the Nazis" ends up illustrating how the Nazis failed miserably in their cultural enterprise.
