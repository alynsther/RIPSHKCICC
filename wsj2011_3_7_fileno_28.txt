LONDON—European stocks reversed gains in a late-session selloff Monday, as U.S. markets turned negative, amid worries about how rising oil prices might impact the broader economy. 

The Stoxx Europe 600 index closed down 0.4% at 280.72. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 index fell 0.3% to 5973.78, France's CAC-40 index ended down 0.7% at 3990.41 and Germany's DAX dropped 0.2% to 7161.93. 

Oil prices were very much in focus again as investors worried about the potential for civil war in Libya as well as the possible spread of unrest to oil-rich Saudi Arabia, which would threaten oil supplies. Crude-oil futures rose to their highest level in more than two years, with the April Nymex contract nudging beyond the $106-a-barrel mark. This initially helped to push the Stoxx Europe 600 oil and gas index up significantly, but the index pared gains into the close, to end down 0.1%.

At the same time, a flight to safety pushed gold prices to an all-time high of $1445.05 intraday, although gold eased back again in line with oil prices later in the day. 

The mood was fairly uncertain Monday, as investors weighed up some upbeat corporate news against continuing worries about Libyan and Middle Eastern unrest, as well as a downgrade of Greece's credit rating by Moody's Investors Service. Moody's cut the country's government bond rating by three notches to B1 from Ba1 and cautioned it could be cut further, given risks to the country's stabilization efforts. The move hit banking stocks, causing the Stoxx Europe 600 index for the sector to close down 0.8% at 208.24. 

The economic calendar looks fairly light again on Tuesday, with German industrial orders at 1100 GMT, while in the U.S., Goldman Sachs chain store sales are at 1245 GMT. 

In the currency markets, the euro lost ground against the dollar as Greece's credit-rating downgrade weighed. By the time of the European stock markets close, the single currency was trading at $1.3982 from $1.3990 late Friday. Sterling last traded at $1.6218 from $1.6277, and the dollar was at 82.10 yen from 82.30 yen.

Late in Europe, light, sweet crude for April delivery was up $1.05 at $105.47 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Gold for April delivery was little changed at $1,434.00 per troy ounce late in Europe on the Comex division of Nymex. 

In major market action: On the upside, the luxury-goods sector got a boost from M&A activity, after LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton announced a €4.3 billion deal to take control of Italy's Bulgari, which represents a premium of around 61% for the company. LVMH shares gained 1.3%, while Bulgari surged 59%.

Technology stocks were also strong, with shares of telecom-equipment maker Alcatel-Lucent rallying almost 4% in Paris. The stock has surged 13% this month on talk of a possible takeover bid from a Chinese company. Analysts at Berenberg reportedly also upgraded the stock Monday to "buy" from "sell."

In London, Inmarsat slumped more than 13% after the satellite-network operator's results included a cautious forecast.

Shares in German engines and power-trains maker Tognum soared 23% after Daimler and Rolls-Royce Group said they are in talks with Tognum about a possible takeover of the firm.

Salzgitter fell 1.6% in Frankfurt after the steelmaker reported a 2010 profit that fell short of market expectations.

Among banks, Société Générale fell 2% and Credit Agricole sank 1.8% in France, while Intesa Sanpaolo slipped 1.7% in Italy, and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria dropped 1.4% in Spain.
