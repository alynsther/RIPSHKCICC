Rex Ryan's genius this postseason has been to suppress the blitzing tendencies that are embedded in his coaching DNA. The Jets' first two opponents favored short passing games, which made them difficult to sack. So Mr. Ryan changed his typical philosophy by instead dropping seven or eight defenders into coverage. 

But his opponent Sunday, Ben Roethlisberger, is a different breed of quarterback. His game is predicated more on downfield passing than Tom Brady's or Peyton Manning's. Mr. Roethlisberger ranked second in 2010 in the average distance his completions traveled in the air past the line of scrimmage (8.18 yards). Messrs. Brady and Manning were ranked 23rd and 22nd, respectively.

The extra split seconds that Mr. Roethlisberger takes on average to complete his longer passes betters the odds that a blitzer will disrupt the play or even make a sack. The Steelers this year finished 30th in sack percentage allowed. And Mr. Roethlisberger was dumped at a rate more than three times greater than Mr. Manning and nearly twice that of Mr. Brady. While this is due mostly to sub-par play on the offensive line, Mr. Roethlisberger's mobility has been compromised since a late-season foot injury.

When the teams met last month, the Jets held Mr. Roethlisberger to a season-low completion rate by sending five or more rushers on 12 of 47 pass plays (25.5%). That's more blitzing than Mr. Ryan called for against Messrs. Manning and Brady in 77 combined attempts, yet well below the Jets regular-season average. Then, opponents were mostly concerned with figuring out who Mr. Ryan would chose to unleash. But thus far in January, they're left to wonder whether any Jets will come at all.
