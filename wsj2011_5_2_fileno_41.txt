NEW DELHI â€“ Maruti Suzuki India Ltd., Tata Motors Ltd., Hero Honda Motors Ltd., Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. and Bajaj Auto Ltd. posted higher sales for April even as a rise in vehicle prices, fuel costs and loan rates hurt customer sentiment. 

Growth in vehicle sales at most auto makers was slower in April than the previous month as several companies raised prices to offset the impact of higher raw material costs. Also, borrowing costs are rising as the central bank increases interest rates to tame inflation. April sales are also traditionally lower than in March, when companies in India give bulk orders for vehicles to save on depreciation costs in the past financial year. 

Automobile sales in India grew at a record 27% in the financial year through March to 15.51 million units, but the industry expects the pace this year to be around 12%-15% due to the higher sales base. Local car sales rose 30% in the past year - the fastest in more than a decade - to 1.98 million autos. 

Maruti, India's largest car maker by sales, posted a 4% rise in total vehicle sales to 97,155 autos in April. Its sales in March had surged 28% to 121,952 vehicles while those in the past year rose 25% to 1.27 million units. 

The local unit of Suzuki Motor Corp. said sales of its small cars grew 2% to 57,443 units. It sells eight small cars including the Alto, Alto K10, Swift, Ritz and M800. 

Tata Motors said over the weekend that local sales of its car and sport-utility vehicles rose 1.2% to 23,387 autos in April, aided primarily by a more than doubling of the Nano minicar's sales. The company sold 10,012 Nanos in the month. In comparison, sales of cars and SUVs in March stood at 27,678 vehicles, including 8,707 units of the Nano. 

Total vehicle sales at Tata Motors, India's largest auto maker by revenue, rose 13% in April to 64,383 autos. Truck and bus sales in the month surged 19% to 30,963 vehicles while exports grew 36% to 4,258 vehicles. 

Sales at Mahindra, India's biggest utility vehicle maker by sales, rose 23% to 32,090 vehicles. Local sales grew 21% to 30,349 while exports more than doubled to 1,741 units, it said. 

The company sold 15,459 units of its utility vehicles Bolero, Scorpio and Xylo and sedan Verito, up 20% from a year earlier. Total sales of tractors were up 14% at 18,530 units. 

Sales at Toyota Kirloskar Motor Pvt. Ltd. rose 61% to 9,681 autos in April, helped by higher demand for sedan Etios. The company said it produced 2,900 fewer vehicles in April due to lower auto part supplies from Japan, where production at several factories has been hit by the recent earthquake. 

Volkswagen Passenger Cars India said it sold 7,000 vehicles in the month, up from 1,489 a year earlier, driven by higher sales of its Polo small car and Vento sedan. 

Hyundai Motor Co.'s local unit said sales rose marginally to 52,058 as a decline in exports offset higher domestic sales. Local sales grew 11% to 31,636 units while exports fell 13% to 20,422 units. 

"Rising interest rates have led to reduced enquires and the conversion rate too has slowed down. We expect the same trend to continue in coming months," said Arvind Saxena, director of sales and marketing at Hyundai Motor India Ltd. 

Hero Honda said sales crossed 500,000 for the second consecutive month. It sold 517,099 two-wheelers in April, up 39% from a year earlier. 

Bajaj Auto reported a 17% jump in its total vehicle sales to 367,309 vehicles. Motorcycle sales in April also grew 17% to 322,235 units while sales of three-wheelers rose 21% to 45,074 units, India's second-biggest two-wheeler maker by sales said. 

TVS Motor Co. posted a 14% rise in its total vehicle sales to 167,744 units. Scooter sales in the past month grew 31% to 35,074 units while motorcycles sales rose 5% to 69,573 units, the company said over the weekend. 

Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India Pvt. Ltd., a unit of Honda Motor Co., said sales in April remained flat at 136,623 as it touched peak capacity. The company's scooter sales rose 3% to 75,108 units, while motorcycle sales declined 4% to 61,515 units, it said.
