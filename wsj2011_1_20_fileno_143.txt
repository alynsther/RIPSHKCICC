Transportation Security Administration rules that restrict liquids and gels in carry-on bags have been a blow to snow-globe collectors. But some people have found a way around the ban: drain the liquid.

"It turns out that the plastic ones have a little hole in the bottom," says  Michael Muntner, who displays his 7,000-piece snow-globe collection in his Bethesda, Md., and Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., homes. (And a storage facility, too.)

Mr. Muntner, 70, says he has used the technique more than 100 times in his 20 years of collecting. But be warned, the process is tricky.

First, Mr. Muntner carefully pulls out the stopper. Fingernails help, but a small, flat screwdriver works, too. The water won't immediately flow out because the hole is small and surface tension holds it back.

To overcome this, Mr. Muntner inserts a thin straw—a hollow coffee-stirrer works well—into the hole. 

While holding the globe over the sink with the bottom angled downward, blow into the straw. The water flows out around the straw. Not to worry, he says, very little of the glittery "snow" comes out. 

For refilling Mr. Muntner suggests holding the snow globe base-up under a needle-thin stream of tap water. Then, re-insert the stopper. 

He cautions that this method works with the cheaper domes made in China. (With German ones, air bubbles form inside the globe with anything but distilled water. "Way too much trouble," he says.)

A TSA spokesman confirmed that a fully drained snow globe would be allowed to travel in carry-on baggage.
