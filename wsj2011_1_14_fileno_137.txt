Wojtek Wolski scored his first goal as a Ranger, Henrik Lundqvist made 31 saves and New York beat Vancouver on Thursday night.

The Rangers' win snapped a 17-game regulation unbeaten streak for the NHL-best Canucks. Mr. Lundqvist made a point-blank save on Alex Burrows in the closing seconds to preserve the shutout, his sixth of the season.

Mr. Wolski, acquired this week from Phoenix, knocked in a rebound on the power play at 7:18 of the second period.
