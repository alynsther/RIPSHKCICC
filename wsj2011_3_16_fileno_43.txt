NEW DELHI -- India won't alter its plans to massively scale up its nuclear power capacity following the crisis in Japan, but it may consider implementing "additional safeguards" at its plants to prevent any catastrophe, Environment and Forests Minister Jairam Ramesh said Tuesday.

The statement comes after officials reported a third explosion and warned of possible damage to a critical reactor container at the troubled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power complex. There was an explosion Saturday at the reactor following Friday's devastating quake and tsunami.

"We should go beyond the immediate crisis which has hit the nuclear industry and recognize that the nuclear option is one we cannot foreclose," Mr. Ramesh told reporters.

India has 20 nuclear power reactors with a capacity of 4,780 megawatts, which are operated by state-run Nuclear Power Corp. of India Ltd. as the country doesn't let private sector companies operate nuclear plants. India aims to expand its nuclear power generating capacity to 63,000 megawatts by 2032.

"I know Nuclear Power Corp. is re-looking at all its safety systems, re-looking at designs...and based on the technical review Nuclear Power Corp. does, if additional safeguard is needed as part of environment clearance, we will certainly look at it," Mr. Ramesh said.

Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh Monday announced a review of nuclear reactors in the country in the wake of the problems in Japan.
