NEW DELHI --India's multiplex operator PVR's board has approved a proposal to sell its unit CR Retail Malls India to JM Financial Group. 

PVR will receive 1 billion rupees ($22.3 million) from the sale, partly in cash and partly in the form of a refund of loans made to CR Retail. 

PVR will sell the entire 20 million shares of CR Retail Malls, at 10 rupees (22 cents) per share, as well as real estate in Mumbai's Phoenix Mills complex, said Nitin Sood, PVR's chief financial officer. 

CR Retail Malls India operates a seven-screen multiplex in Phoenix Mills. After the sale, PVR will continue to operate the multiplex "on a long-term lease arrangement basis," the company said.
