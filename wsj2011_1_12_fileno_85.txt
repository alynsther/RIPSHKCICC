Philanthropists Jonathan and  Lizzie Tisch have donated $10 million to finance a new costume exhibition space at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the museum announced Tuesday. 

Along with the creation of the 4,200-square-foot Lizzie and Jonathan Tisch Gallery, the gift will allow the museum to renovate its study collection and conservation center. The center will house the combined costume collections of the Met and the Brooklyn Museum, which transferred its collection to the Met in 2009.

Mr. Tisch is the chairman and chief executive of Loews Hotels.

"This gift is truly transformative," the museum's director,  Thomas P. Campbell, said in a statement. "The Lizzie and Jonathan Tisch Gallery is designed as a distinctly flexible space, so the possibilities for creative interpretations of the collection are unlimited."
