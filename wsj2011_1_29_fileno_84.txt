The New York Mets' owners may sell a minority stake in the team in light of litigation stemming from Bernard Madoff's fraud. Fred Wilpon, the team's principal owner, said Friday he is considering the sale in order to remove uncertainty about funding the organization's operations. The trustee seeking to recover funds on behalf of victims of Mr. Madoff's Ponzi scheme sued Mr. Wilpon and his real-estate investment firm, Sterling Equities Associates, in December. The team could also seek additional financing.

Steelers' coach Mike Tomlin also got nine times more searches than Green Bay's Mike McCarthy. However, the term "Green Bay Packers" garnered 2.4 times the number of searches than "Pittsburgh Steelers."
