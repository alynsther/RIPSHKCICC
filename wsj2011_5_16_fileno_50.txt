NEW DELHI -- The Indian unit of  Toyota Motor Corp. said Monday it will advance resumption of normal operations at its vehicle manufacturing plant as supply of parts from Japan is improving.

Toyota Kirloskar Motor Pvt. Ltd. said also that it's on track to introduce its first small car, Etios Liva, as scheduled in the last week of June.

"Toyota Kirloskar's parts sourcing is getting back on track, production will return back to normal levels starting May 20," the company said. "Plans are afoot to recover loss of production and reduce the waiting period [on cars]."

Toyota Kirloskar, 89% owned by Toyota, had on April 22 announced suspension of vehicle production on every Monday and Friday from April 25 to June 4 due to disruption in parts supply from Japan following the March 11 earthquake and tsunami.

The company has two factories in the southern state of Karnataka where it produces the Corolla Altis, Innova and Fortuner models. It also imports and markets the Camry, Prado, Land Cruiser and Prius vehicles.

"Our focus is to reduce the backlog and jointly work with our vendors to minimize delivery delays," said  Hiroshi Nakagawa, Toyota Kirloskar's managing director.
