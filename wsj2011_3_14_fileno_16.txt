HONG KONGâ€”Ping An Insurance (Group) Co. of China Ltd. said it plans to sell a 3.4% stake to a firm controlled by Hong Kong tycoon  Cheng Yu-tung for HK$19.45 billion (US$2.50 billion) in a move to strengthen the Shenzhen-based company's capital base. 

Ping An, second only to China Life Insurance Co. in terms of premiums among mainland life companies, said it will issue 272 million new Hong Kong-listed H shares to Chow  Tai Fook Nominee Ltd. at HK$71.50 each, representing a 12.5% discount to the stock's Friday closing price of HK$81.70. 

Chow Tai Fook is subject to a six-month lockup period following the share acquisition, according to Ping An, adding that the share sale has been approved by its board as well as by Chinese regulators. 

The company said its Hong Kong-listed shares will resume trading Tuesday. Trading was halted early Monday ahead of the share-sale announcement. 

Mr. Cheng is chairman of blue-chip Hong Kong property developer New World Development Co. In recent years, he taken part in many initial public offerings in Hong Kong as a so-called cornerstone investor. 

Ping An spokesman  Richard Sheng said earlier the company has no plans to raise funds on mainland China's stock markets.
