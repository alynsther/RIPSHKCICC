Indi-who? 

It isn't a brand known outside of India, but IndiGo Airlines just put itself on the map by signing a nearly $16 billion order for 180 Airbus A320 jets. Airbus says this is the biggest order ever, by number of aircraft. Even more astonishing is that it comes on top of an outstanding 2006 order for 100 planes. Only 32 of those have been delivered so far. 

Privately held IndiGo is readying itself for a change in the way Indians travel. Already, 47 million people flew domestically in India between January and November of last year, nearly thrice the number in 2004. This is expected to grow more than ninefold in the next decade, the Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation predicts. 

IndiGo's ambition is to grab a large share of this. So far it is succeeding by offering no-frills flights that save a lot of time and don't cost substantially more than train tickets. It charges for meals and uses the journey to sell everything from perfumes to watches. 

This is working well, in part because IndiGo was launched with a low-cost model in mind. It uses a single type of aircraft that cuts maintenance and training costs, for example. Some rivals, on the other hand, have only recently decided to compete for low-cost business. By November, IndiGo was India's third-busiest airline with nearly 18% of the market by number of passengers carried within the country. This is up from less than 12% of the market in 2008. 

And the company's president,  Aditya Ghosh, says it has been profitable since the year ending March 2009, only three years after starting operations. In the year through March 2010, the company earned $107 million. By comparison, Kingfisher Airlines, which started operations at the same time as IndiGo, but as a premium carrier, has yet to make a profit. 

The new aircraft will also help IndiGo expand overseas. It could get permission for international routes in August, when it completes a mandatory five years of domestic operations, the president says. The new jets are ideal for short-haul flights to the Middle East and Southeast Asiaâ€”important destinations for India's expatriate workers and holidaymakers. 

Some challenges await. The new aircraft will be delivered from 2016 to 2025, but IndiGo admits it hasn't nailed down a plan to finance these purchases. India's banks are already heavily exposed to some of IndiGo's loss-making rivals, so they may be wary of lending heavily to another carrier. 

But for IndiGo, this isn't a flight of fancy.
