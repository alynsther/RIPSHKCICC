MUMBAI â€“Indian shares Friday snapped their longest losing streak in a decade as a sharp fall in crude prices triggered a bout of short-covering in battered large-cap stocks, particularly in the banking and auto sectors. 

The Bombay Stock Exchange's Sensitive Index rose 308.23 points, or 1.7%, to close at 18,518.81. On the National Stock Exchange, the 50-stock S&P CNX Nifty gained 91.60 points, or 1.7%, to end at 5,551.45. 

Trading volume on the BSE rose to 33.89 billion rupees ($756 million) from Thursday's 27.34 billion rupees. Gainers outnumbered decliners 1,632 to 1,174, while 123 stocks were unchanged. 

"A bounce was due as the market was over-sold and the fall in crude prices provided the trigger," said  Alex Mathews, head of research at Geojit BNP Paribas Financial Services. 

Nymex crude for June delivery was trading $2.43 down at $97.37 per barrel, extending Thursday's $9.44 overnight fall. 

If crude prices remain soft next week, further share gains are likely as a sustained period of lower commodity prices will cool inflationary expectations, Mathews added. 

Indian shares had seen heavy losses after the Reserve Bank of India Tuesday raised its lending rate by a sharper-than-expected one-half percentage point and said reining in inflation is the top priority, even if there are some short-term costs by way of lower economic growth. 

Of the 30 Sensex constituents, 24 ended higher Friday. 

Gains were led by rate-sensitive shares such as banking and auto, which had been battered the most in the wake of the RBI's rate increase. 

ICICI Bank, India's second-largest lender by assets, rose 5.2% to 1,081.35 rupees after having fallen 7.7% in the week till Thursday.  HDFC Bank added 3.6% to 2,299.15 rupees. 

In autos,  Tata Motors rose 5.7% to 1,200.95 rupees and Mahindra & Mahindra closed 3.0% higher at 712.55 rupees. 

Technology shares rose on bargain buying following recent sharp losses due to concerns about demand for outsourced services. 

  Infosys Technologies, which has the second-highest weighting in the Sensex, rose 1.5% to 2,886.90 rupees and Tata Consultancy Services rose 2.7% to 1,144.55 rupees. 

In laggards,  Sterlite Industries fell 1.5% to 167.60 rupees due to a fall in copper prices. 

Telecom services provider Bharti Airtel fell 1.9% to 350.75 rupees, adding to Thursday's losses after a lackluster January-March earnings performance. 

Among non-Sensex losers, SKS Microfinance tumbled 19.8% to an all-time low of 331.30 rupees after J.P. Morgan slashed its target price for the stock and forecast a heavy loss for the microlender in the fiscal year that started April 1.
