MUMBAIâ€“India's power ministry expects to get environmental clearance for a planned 4,000 megawatt project in Orissa state in the first half of February, Power Secretary P.  Uma Shankar said Monday. 

"We are in an advanced stage of consultations with the Ministry of Environment and Forests," Mr. Shankar told reporters. 

The Orissa plant, one of several so-called ultra mega power projects planned by the Indian government to rapidly expand generation capacity, has been stuck for several months mainly because of a lack of environmental approvals. That has forced the power ministry to repeatedly extend the bid submission deadline for the project. 

The government has so far awarded four such projects to private-sector players--one to Tata Power Co. and three to Reliance Power Ltd. 

The project in east India's Orissa state and another in neighboring Chhattisgarh were to be awarded next, but Mr. Shankar said the coal blocks identified for these projects have "some problems in terms of forest clearances." 

While all the coal blocks for the Chhattisgarh project fall under the environment ministry's restricted area for mining activities, only one block for the Orissa plant is in such an area, he said. The bid submission date for the Orissa project has been extended to March 31 from Jan. 31, he said. 

Mr. Shankar also said the government plans to set up a 4,000 megawatt project that will use imported coal at Cheyyur in southern India's Tamil Nadu state. The feasibility study for the project is likely to be ready by April, he added.
