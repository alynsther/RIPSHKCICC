The annual National Magazine Awards are the publishing equivalent of the Oscars, but with a far longer running time. When the finalists for the gathering were announced a month ago, top honchos at Cond√© Nast, Hearst and Time Inc. swiftly scooped up the best tables at the Park Avenue Armory. Four hours into the ceremony Monday, many seemed to be devising elaborate escape plans.

The media's biggest free agent,  Katie Couric, volunteered to emcee the night to plug her new book. More than two hours after the doors opened, when most of guests were finished with their halibut and strawberry shortcake, Ms. Couric finally took the stage. "I'm sorry I missed the cocktail hour," she said. "And now I'll have to have few drinks to keep up with this rowdy crowd."

While Ms. Couric was taking her time,  David Copperfield employed a magic trick to open one envelope. A trained dog was another well-received presenter. Meanwhile,  Bethenny Frankel, Dr. Mehmet Oz and "Biggest Loser" star  Jillian Michaels were stuck waiting for Single Topic Issue winner like everyone else. Were some of them looking for editorial work? "You never know," said Ms. Frankel, a reality-TV star. "I might need a bigger forum one day than 140 character Tweets."

The winners included  David Zinczenko (for Men's and Women's Health), career honoree  Tom Wolfe, New York and National Geographic. As the speeches became tedious, Ms. Couric couldn't hold back. "Now we know why none of you guys went into television," she cracked. The room finally roared with approval.
