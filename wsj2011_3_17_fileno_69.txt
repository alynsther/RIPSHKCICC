Here are the second-round games that are predicted to be most exciting.

In a perfect world, we would all drop whatever we're doing Thursday and feast on March Madness for 36 straight hours. The problem is that most of us have lives.

Fortunately, a group of committed mathematicians has developed a way to help us narrow the field. The website Thuuz, which measures the likely excitement level of various sporting events, has come up with an NCAA tournament viewing priority list for Thursday's and Friday's second-round action. They say Missouri vs. Cincinnati (Thursday, 9:50 p.m., TNT), Utah State vs. Kansas State (Thursday, 9:57 p.m., truTV) and George Mason vs. Villanova (Friday, 2:10 p.m., TNT) are the games to watch. 

In their analysis, all three contests registered a predicted score of 80 on a scale of 100. (By way of comparison, Murray State's buzzer-beater upset of No. 4-seed Vanderbilt last year posted an actual score of 98, while Duke's first-round rout of Arkansas-Pine Bluff scored zero. 

To determine the rankings, Thuuz plugs data about each team into an algorithm. They also take outside factors into account, such as the magnitude of the game and the history between the squads. Thuuz determined that the three teams with top scores this year are all evenly matched, are often involved in close games and play at a fast pace, which generally leads to excitement.

Even with advanced analytics, it's impossible to know which games will suddenly turn into barnburners. Last year, one of the most exciting games of the first round was 15th-seeded Robert Morris pushing Villanova to overtime. Few saw that one coming.
