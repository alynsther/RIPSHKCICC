iGATE's $304.5 million open offer to buy 20% of Patni Computer Systems has been fully subscribed, according to a person familiar with the matter said. 

The open offer is the final leg of iGate's up to $1.22 billion deal, along with Apax Partners, for an about 83% stake in Patni. It follows the U.S.-listed software firm's joint pact with the private-equity company to buy a 63% stake from Patni's founders and private-equity firm General Atlantic LLC.

Under Indian rules, anyone buying a stake of 15% or more in a company requires to make an open offer to the public to buy a minimum of 20% in the target company at a price at least as high as the price paid for the initial stake purchase.

The open offer was launched at 503.50 rupees per share, the same price which iGate and Apax paid Patni's founders and General Atlantic. The offer ran between April 8 and April 27.

Patni's stock was trading down 0.6% at 427.75 rupees on the Bombay Stock Exchange at 0955 GMT, compared with a 0.7% fall in the benchmark Sensitive Index.

The success of the open offer could pave the way for a potential delisting of Patni, according to analysts tracking the sector. Indian laws require a listed entity to keep 10% of equity for the public.

The deal was driven by iGate's search for scale as it seeks to compete with larger peers in a volatile global economic environment. Patni has struggled to capitalize on the return of demand for software services post crisis. Both companies hope to trim costs and boost sales through the combined entity.

The open offer is being executed through two iGate units -- Pan-Asia iGate Solutions Ltd. and iGate Global Solutions Ltd. -- along with iGate Corp.

Kotak Mahindra Capital Co. managed the open offer.

Earlier in April, iGate raised $700 million through an issue of senior notes to refinance the short-term debt it had initially taken to fund the purchase.
