In the 1830s, the Suez route—steamship to Alexandria, overland to Port Suez, steamer across the Arabian Sea—halved the travel time from London to India: three months rather than six. (It would halve again with the opening of the canal in 1869.) For all England's pride in its empire, few Englishman had any sense of it before the 1850s. With the dawn of photography, intrepid travelers began bringing the imperial world home. Felice Beato (1832-1909) was drawn east by war—in 1855, he and a partner took over Roger Fenton's duties photographing in the Crimea. Beato then pushed on to India and documented the Indian Mutiny. These images ensure his place in the pantheon of war photographers, but his sepia-toned panoramas of the Far East are equally gripping. The portrait above—formal due to the long exposure time—shows a British army medical unit in Burma sometime between 1887 and 1897. The officers and men pose with their various ambulances (a 'charjamah' on the back of an elephant, a hand-drawn 'dandy' and a bullock cart). An image likely made for the officers' mess, it is extraordinary in its very ordinariness. Beato spent more than 50 years living in India, Burma, China and Japan, and his photographs are full of such quotidian delights. His life is well-told in Anne Lacoste's superb study: 'Felice Beato: A Photographer on the Eastern Road' (Getty, 202 pages, $39.95), and the  prints remain as revelatory today as they were to a 19th-century audience.
