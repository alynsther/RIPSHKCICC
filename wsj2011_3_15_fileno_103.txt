The last time Jason Isringhausen pitched for the Mets, the world had just been introduced to Jar Jar Binks and the Backstreet Boys were the most popular band in the country.

The 38-year-old righty last suited up for the Mets in the summer of 1999. Should he become successful in his attempt to make the team, he'll hold the record for longest intermission between years with the club. Isringhausen, who last pitched in the majors in 2009, recently passed his first big spring test—pitching in back-to-back games. Thus far, he's allowed a lone run on two hits and a walk in five innings (1.80 ERA).

His 11-year hiatus from 1999 to 2011 would surpass the club record of 10 shared by three players. Bob Miller went 1-12 for that original Mets team that lost 120 games. He returned in 1973 for one inning with the eventual NL champions. David Cone was traded shortly after being the Mets lone All-Star representative in 1992. He would return in 2003 and compile three losses in 18 terrible innings (6.50 ERA). The third, Kelly Stinnett, managed only 12 at bats in his second Mets act. Perhaps the most famous return acts in team history—Tom Seaver in 1983 and Lee Mazzilli in 1986—were after just five and four years, respectively.

Isringhausen was traded long after injuries had already ended dreams of him becoming a dominant starter—along with fellow members of "Generation K," Paul Wilson and Bill Pulsipher. But Isringhausen quickly transformed into an ace closer (293 career saves), and now he hopes to stick as Francisco Rodriguez's setup man. Despite his early spring success, this quest still seems quixotic considering how rudely he was treated last summer in the minors (12 baserunners and six runs in just 5.7 innings).

Here are the players with the longest gap between seasons with the Mets. Jason Isringhausen, below, would rank first at 11 seasons if he makes the team this year.
