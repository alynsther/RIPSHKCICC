While all of Rex Ryan's bluster may not have won his team the Super Bowl he has promised, it has wrought something else: marketing magic. 

Tuesday, the line outside the New York City bookstore where the Jets coach was signing his new autobiography snaked around a corner. Late Monday night, four of the five sports Emmys won by NFL Films were Jets-centered, three for its HBO-aired "Hard Knocks," featuring the Jets' training camp. And Monday night on an appearance on "Late Show with David Letterman," Ryan said he thought the team's former strength coach, Sal Alosi, who resigned after tripping an opposing player along the sideline last season, deserved another shot in the NFL.

Ryan appeared slightly uncomfortable discussing the matter with Letterman, who questioned whether the incident showed the underhanded "black arts of football.''

Yankee first baseman Mark Teixeira has landed a cameo role on the final season of his favorite show, HBO's "Entourage," playing himself, he said Tuesday. "It's my favorite show on TV; I've not missed an episode," Teixeira said.

Teixeira will join the Knicks' Amar'e Stoudemire as investors in a New York restaurant, Queens' Don Peppe, as series mainstay Turtle, played by Jerry Ferrara, tries to bring the restaurant to Los Angeles. Teixeira will appear once.
