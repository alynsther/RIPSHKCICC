 MOSCOWâ€”Russian President Dmitry Medvedev entertained members of his favorite rock band, Deep Purple, with revelations of his past as a teenage disc jockey and a blast of one of their heavy metal hits from an old-fashioned reel-to-reel tape player.

Wearing jeans and a black suit jacket, the 45-year-old president told members of the British group over tea at his residence that he'd become a fan at age 12 while growing up behind the iron curtain. According to Russian news agencies, Mr. Medvedev recalled that as a DJ at school in Leningrad he had to get approval for his playlists from the Communist youth organization.

"Of course, when I started listening to Deep Purple I could not imagine that I would be sitting here with you," Interfax news agency quoted the president as telling his guests.

Deep Purple drummer  Ian Paice presented him with a set of drum sticks, and Mr. Medvedev's 15-year-old son Ilya joined the gathering to strum a guitar with the band. The encounter Tuesday, ahead of a Deep Purple concert in Moscow, was publicized Wednesday by the Kremlin, which seeks to burnish the president's image among young, hip Russians.
