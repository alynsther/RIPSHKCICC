MUMBAI --Sabre Partners will invest 500 million rupees ($11.2 million) in Super Religare Laboratories Ltd., the private equity firm said on Wednesday.

The firm, however, didn't disclose the stake the company will get in the medical diagnostics chain from the deal, which was executed through its "Spring Healthcare" fund.

The deal follows a recent purchase of a 9.27% stake in Super Religare by Avigo Capital Partners for 1 billion rupees ($230.8 million).

Super Religare is owned by the same family that runs Fortis Healthcare (India) Ltd., a chain of hospitals in India.

Fortis Healthcare's board recently approved the acquisition of an about 86% stake in Super Religare.

Super Religare, also, had filed a draft initial public offer document with the Indian capital market regulator in February for a share listing.
