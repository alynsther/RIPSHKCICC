With 11 games remaining and a four-point lead at the top of the Premier League standings, Manchester United is edging towards a record-breaking 19th league title.

But starting Tuesday, the fabled English football club faces two games in five days that could define its season: First, the Red Devils play Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday night; then on Sunday, United faces its perennial rival Liverpool at Anfield.

In recent years, games between United and Chelsea have been about which of these two would end up lifting the Premier League trophy: The two clubs have combined to win seven of the past eight championships. But with three months of the season remaining, Chelsea appears out of the title race: It is 15 points behind and on a dismal run of four wins from 14 games. Oddsmakers have the Blues are as long as 22/1 to retain their title.

Still, most observers expect a close game at Stamford Bridge, where Chelsea hasn't lost to United since 2003. Chelsea won both league games last season and is favorite here at 6/5 with Stan James and Boylesports. 

That price is partly explained by United's poor record on the roadâ€”Sir Alex Ferguson's team has won only four times in 13 away fixtures. Even so, there is little for United to fear here. With Chelsea's last six home games producing as many defeats as victories, there is value in backing United at 14/5 with Victor Chandler to win, or secure a draw at 23/10.
