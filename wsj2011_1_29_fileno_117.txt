For 20 years, New Yorkers have had something to look forward to in bleak midwinter: City Bakery's "Real Hot Chocolate."

Sipping the rich, viscous brew is like imbibing the star ingredient in molten form. As he kicks off his venue's annual February Hot Chocolate Festival (a different flavor every day), baker/owner Maury Rubin unveils a boxed version of the beverage (note: it's not a mix or a powder—it's ready to drink).

He's starting out with milk chocolate, dark chocolate and caramel, to 

be available at specialty stores in the New York area. Expect new flavors and westward expansion later in the year. From $6, thecitybakery.com 

Surrey-based chef and food writer Skye Gygnell introduced her latest cookbook, "A Year In My Kitchen," to her countrymen in October. 

The U.S. version releases on Tuesday. Arranged seasonally, it takes nature's bounty and, with a few surprising spices and sauces, presents simple, sophisticated dishes.

The recipes are easy, and the beautifully photographed edition is compact enough to carry to the market to help you figure out what's for supper.

Tonight you might fancy the pan-fried veal chops with rosemary and almond aioli. $14, amazon.com 

Beans are a must-have pantry tem and Napa Valley farm Rancho Gordo delivers the cream of the crop.

This winter, through itsXoxoc Project, which supports Mexico's producers, the West Coast farm introduced Alubia Blanca from San Jose Iturbide, a small town in the Sierra Gorda of Quertero. 

Near extinction, these white gems have been in their farmer's family for generations; each year, he saves seeds to preserve the strain. Back at the California ranch, Rancho Gordo founder Steve Sandoprepares them with a simple mirepoix, olive oil and grated Parmesan cheese. $6 per lb., ranchogordo.com
