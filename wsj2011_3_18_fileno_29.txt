"While the global markets are rebounding after the earthquake in Japan, India is underperforming because of rising crude prices," said  Dipan Mehta, director at Dipan Mehta Share & Stock Brokers. "It is a straight bet that if crude prices rise the Sensex will fall."

Analysts say high crude prices will fan inflation concerns and increase pressure on India's central bank to tighten monetary policy further. Thursday, the RBI increased its key policy rates by 0.25 percentage point--in line with estimates--but raised its inflation estimate for end-March to 8%, from 7% previously, and said the underlying inflationary pressures in the economy have accentuated. 

All but two of the 30 Sensex constituents closed lower Friday.

The stock, which carries the highest weight in the Sensex, fell 3.7% to 993.15 rupees.
