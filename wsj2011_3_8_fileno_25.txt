Stocks fell Monday as investors continued to fret over the potential impact of rising oil prices amid more turmoil in Libya, while the technology sector was also hurt by an analyst downgrade. 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 79.85 points, or 0.7%, to 12090.03. Chip giant  Intel

 was among the measure's weakest components, off 35 cents, or 1.6%, to $21.21, after Wells Fargo cut its view of the semiconductor sector to "market weight" from "overweight" for the first time in more than two years. Still, the bank called the move "more an indication of a more moderate though still optimistic view of the sector rather than any active concern about the chip stocks as a group."

The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index shed 11.02, or 0.8%, to 1310.13, with its technology and materials sectors leading the drop. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite got hit even harder, down 39.04, or 1.4%, to 2745.63.

The sector was hurt not only by the analyst downgrade but also by concerns over the impact on the sector from rising energy prices. 

"If you're paying more for the transportation of your goods, you're probably going to pay less for the technology that goes into moving your goods," said  John Canally, economist and investment strategist at LPL Financial. 

Crude-oil futures remained elevated on worries that heavy fighting in Libya would damage oil infrastructure. Forces loyal to Col. Moammar Gadhafi launched air strikes on a rebel-held town to check the rebels' advance west toward the capital, as the United Nations called on Libyan authorities to end hostilities and appointed a special envoy to the country. An air strike hit Ras Lanuf, a key oil port east of Tripoli. 

With no end in sight for the conflict, the oil market began to price in a much longer interruption to Libya's production of 1.6 million barrels a day. 

"What people are beginning to focus on with oil is the economic weakness that could come from a sustained rise in oil prices," said  Brian Lazorishak, portfolio manager and quantitative analyst at Chase Investment Counsel. "It's obviously a drag on consumer spending, it can be a drag on economic growth, and everybody feels like, while the economy is showing some good signs of a recovery, it's kind of a fragile recovery." 

Traders are particularly concerned about the situation in Saudi Arabia, where some have called for demonstrations later in the week. Société Générale said in a research note that oil could reach $200 a barrel if supplies from Saudi Arabia were disrupted. 

"Saudi Arabia's a much bigger deal on the price of crude than Libya," said  Russell Croft, co-manager of the Croft Value Fund.

Investors were also reminded of economic troubles in the euro zone Monday after Moody's Investors Service slashed Greece's credit rating by three notches, dragging the European sovereign deeper into "junk" territory, citing uncertainty facing bondholders from 2013.

 agreed to acquire  Hitachi's hard-disk-drive business for about $4.3 billion in cash and stock. Shares of Western Digital surged 4.67, or 16%, to 34.68. The deal would consolidate the three biggest players in the disk-drive industry into two, amid a slowing PC market and increased popularity of disk-drive-free tablets like the iPad.

 fell 2.83, or 9.8%, to 25.98, after the network-systems company's fiscal-first-quarter loss widened as a surge in operating expenses offset a bigger-than-expected jump in revenue. Ciena also predicted weaker-than-expected revenue for the current quarter. 

  James River Coal jumped 2.96, or 15%, to 23.21, after the coal company announced an acquisition aimed at expanding access to export markets and increasing sales of high-margin coal used in steel making. The company said it would pay $475 million in cash for International Resource Partners and Logan & Kanawha Coal Company.

 fell 52 cents, or 1.9%, to 26.57, after the company said it plans to offer as much as $250 million in common shares to expand and pay down existing debt.

 shed 1.01, or 10%, to 9, after the company agreed to acquire TomoTherapy for about $277 million in cash and stock, a deal that would combine the two firms' radiotherapy and radiation oncology treatments. The deal values TomoTherapy at $4.80 a share, a 31% premium over its closing price Friday. TomoTherapy shares surged 90 cents, or 25%, to 4.57. 

  China Fire & Security Group climbed 76 cents, or 12%, to 7.02. The provider of industrial fire-protection products said it has received a nonbinding letter from a private-equity firm proposing to acquire all of its outstanding common stock in cash at a premium. The company said its special committee hasn't made a decision in regard to the proposal and there can be no assurance any definitive offer will be made.
