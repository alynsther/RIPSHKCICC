Academy Award nomination ballots are due on Friday. So, how do you get some last-minute East Coast award season attention? A little lunchtime campaigning.

 On Monday, Sir Harold Evans and "The Duchess" author Amanda Foreman hosted a lunch for Colin Firth and "The King's Speech" at a private literary club in Manhattan. On Tuesday, the cast and filmmakers of "The Social Network" will be celebrated by Amy Pascal and Sony Pictures in the Pool Room at the Four Seasons, and on Wednesday, Ben Affleck and Jon Hamm will try to remind voters about "The Town" at the 21 Club. There are more than 6,000 Academy members. 

"You want to put your movie foremost in the mind of people, especially voters," movie titan Harvey Weinstein said Monday. "These events are helpful reminders. 'The King's Speech' opened first at Telluride in September, 'The Social Network' opened in October. People forget."

Animator and Oscar winner, Jimmy Picker, who will cast a ballot, didn't mind the blatant campaigning. "I'm here to be wooed, and it's always nice to get a free lunch," he said. 

Actress Rutanya Alda admitted that although she was hitting up two lunches this week, "they make no difference in voting." "I think it only matters if you are on the fringe with two movies or actors," she said. 

"Precious" writer and Oscar winner Geoffrey Fletcher's mind, meanwhile, still wasn't made up. "I'm mailing off my ballot right after this lunch."

Mr. Firth didn't walk away with any new takeaways on how the lunch would affect his chances for a Best Actor nod. "In terms of projecting, I'm kept in a slightly infantile position," he said. "I have grownups telling me about all of that. I'm just thinking about my next meeting."
