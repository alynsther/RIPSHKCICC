ROME—One in five young people in Italy are neither working nor studying, in what marks the highest number of "idle" youths in the Europe Union, according to Italian national statistics agency Istat.

The two million people people between the ages of 15 and 29 who are in the category that Istat calls Neet—or not in education, employments or training—represent 21.2% of the population, Istat said.

The proportion of youth in this situation is higher in the south of the country, but is growing even in the richer and more industrialized northern regions of Italy, Istat added.

As a recession, followed by an acute debt crisis, has beset Europe over the past two years, young people across the continent have been among the hardest hit by job cuts and hiring freezes at both private and public companies.

In countries such as Spain, Greece and Italy, the youth unemployment rate has risen particularly fast, becoming one of the most pressing matters on these countries' political agendas.

According to the Istat study, called "We Italy," women's employment is also suffering in Italy. 

The report says 48.9% of Italian women—nearly one out of two—doesn't have a job nor is looking for one. That level of inactivity is lower only in Malta, according to Istat.

The study also shows that Italy spends less than its European counterparts on education. In 2008, the country spent around 4.6% of its GDP on education, compared to the average 5.2% in the rest of the European Union.

Fewer than 20% of Italians in their 30s have a university degree.

The Italian parliament has recently given its final approval to an overhaul of the country's university system, a measure that is part of the government's wide-ranging austerity measures and that is aimed at making the university system more efficient. 

The overhaul sparked weeks of often-violent student protests.
