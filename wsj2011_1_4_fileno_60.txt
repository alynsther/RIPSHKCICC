Cade Massey, an assistant professor at the Yale School of Management, and Rufus Peabody, a Las Vegas sports analyst, developed this ranking system for projecting future performance. "Points" represent a team's predicted point differential against an average team on a neutral field. The rankings are based exclusively on 2010 performance. NFL statistics are adjusted for home field, opponent and game situation, and weighted by their predictive ability (for more information, go to www.massey-peabody.com).

In our final Massey-Peabody NFL Power Rankings, the Jets scratched back into the top 10 after routing the Bills in an exhibition environment, while the Giants ended up the second-best team not to make the playoffs. Only the Chargers (third) ranked higher than Big Blue (sixth) among teams now watching with the rest of us. The ultimate winner of that final NFC wild-card slot was the fourth-ranked Packers, the biggest playoff sleeper on the Massey-Peabody board. 

The Jets (eighth) are a slot higher than Saturday night's opponent, Indianapolis, which has yielded 203 points the past seven weeks. Meanwhile, the rankings say that the Seahawks—the team with the worst record ever to reach the NFL postseason—would lose to an average team on a neutral field by a field goal.
