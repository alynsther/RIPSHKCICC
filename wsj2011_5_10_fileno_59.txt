The J. Paul Getty Trust, one of the world's wealthiest arts organizations and third-largest foundation, has hired a new president and chief executive. 

James Cuno, 60 years old, joins the Getty from the Art Institute of Chicago, where he has served as president and director for the past seven years. He is best known for helping the Chicago museum open its nearly $300 million wing for modern art in 2009. He has previously directed museums based at the University of London, Harvard University, Dartmouth College, Vassar College and the University of California, Los Angeles. 

The trust, which has an endowment of $4.8 billion and total assets of $7.1 billion, funds the Getty Museum and Getty Villa in Los Angeles, as well as the Getty Research Institute, the Conservation Institute and the Getty Foundation. Mr. Cuno is expected to begin his new post on Aug. 1, succeeding James Wood, who died last summer. Interim President Deborah Marrow will resume as director of the Getty's foundation.

The hiring comes at a pivotal time for the Getty. The museum, which gets nearly two million visitors a year, is still searching for a director to succeed Michael Brand, who stepped down last year. The institution is also trying to rebuild its endowment, which is down 25% from its pre-recession peak four years ago.

The museum is also embroiled in an ownership dispute with the Italian government over a statue known as the Getty Bronze, which dates to around the third century B.C. Last spring, an Italian judge ruled that the object had been illegally excavated and must be returned to its homeland. The Getty has appealed, saying it rightfully bought the antiquity in 1977.

Mr. Cuno said one of his first tasks will be to find Mr. Brand's successor. He also said the museum "remains on sure legal footing" in its fight over the Getty Bronze.
