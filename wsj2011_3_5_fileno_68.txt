Offseason acquisition Rafael Soriano has learned that a heavy spring training workload doesn't agree with him. He doesn't throw often, and rarely pitches live batting practice. 

On the rare occasions he does throw, it blows observers away. Yankee manager Joe Girardi said he'd never seen anything like the practice session Soriano threw Friday. 

"Probably as many swings and misses in a batting practice session as I've ever seen. And this is guys knowing what's coming," Girardi said.

For the first time since 2008, Mets pitcher Chris Young has the luxury of worrying more about how he pitches than how he feels. So far, so good. Young, who has been beset by injuries in recent years, did not allow an earned run in three innings Friday in an exhibition game against the Florida Marlins. He has allowed only two hits, two walks and no earned runs in five innings this spring."
