India's World Cup semifinal match against Pakistan on Wednesday takes precedence over all else, for sure. 

But there are other goings-on in the world of finance next week that at least deserve a glance. 

Here are some picks from the Deals India desk:

Central Bank of India has started its rights issue in a bid to raise 25 billion rupees. The national bank, which is in the market until April 7, hopes to use the proceeds to boost its Tier 1 capital used as a reserve against risky assets on its balance sheet.

Then, there's the Indian Railway Finance Corp.'s $200 million dollar-bond issue, which is likely to generate a lot of investor and observer interest. The fund-raising arm of the Indian Railways joins the long list of local companies tapping overseas markets for funding at relatively cheap rates.

Moving from bonds to stocks, the Indian equity market has been anything but kind to initial share sales in recent months. 

Results of the much-watched PTC India Financial Services showed the issue, which was fully subscribed, only saw 8% subscription in the first two days, according to data from the National Stock Exchange. This has left other prospects hesitant, but ready to step in at the first inkling of investor interest. Until then, private equity funds are going to get a lot of calls.

Companies with cash on hand, however, are eager to spend it, and deals are brewing.

Jyothy Laboratories' is expected to hold firm on its bid for Henkel's stake in Henkel India. Other competitors in the fray, including Emami, may reveal their hand this week ahead of the German home-goods maker's start of the bidding process in the April.

Other companies or stakes on the block include Bharti Enterprises' majority stake in Comviva, which is expected to be valued between $300 million and $400 million.
