European bourses closed lower Friday as oil prices rose again, returning investors' attention to the volatile situation in the Mideast and North Africa.

Traders also digested a weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs report.

The Stoxx Europe 600 index spent the morning in the green, hitting an intraday high of 285.4, but turned decidedly lower after the release of U.S. nonfarm payrolls. It closed down 0.6% at 281.90, bringing the weekly loss to 0.8%.

Although the U.S. economy added a solid 192,000 jobs in February, the number fell short of the 200,000 increase that had been expected. A string of upbeat U.S. economic data had fueled hope that the jobs report would be exceptionally strong. 

However, the data included a bigger-than-expected increase in private-sector jobs and bigger-than-expected drop in government-sector jobs. Also, the unemployment rate, which is obtained from a separate household survey, fell to 8.9% last month, the first time it has slipped below 9% since April 2009. 

"Anticipation of a strong jobs number is what drove the markets yesterday. It wasn't going to do it again today," said  Bernard McAlinden, strategist at NCB Stockbrokers. Still, he is optimistic for the medium term, saying that despite the growing risk from the unrest in the Middle East and North Africa, markets are likely to push higher. The biggest threat to the rally remains rising commodity prices. 

U.S. stocks fell, threatening to extend the market's losing streak to a second-straight week, following the mixed jobs report and as investors worried about the impact on of rising energy prices. Just after midday in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 168 points, or 1.4%, at 12090.

Crude-oil futures climbed to nearly $104 a barrel after Libya's capital saw sporadic violence during antigovernment protests, as a heavy clampdown on the city by Col. Moammar Gadhafi spread fear among residents.

U.S. Treasuries rallied. The benchmark 10-year note was 10/32 higher to yield 3.516%. 

Losses on the Stoxx Europe 600 were cushioned by oil-services companies.

Dutch-listed maritime oil and gas engineer SBM Offshore rose 6.3% after it delivered a better-than-expected increase in operating profit in 2010.  Peers Petrofac and Technip rose 3.2% and 1.3%, respectively.

Top losers on the European benchmark included French retail giant  Carrefour, which slumped 4.4% after a Citigroup downgrade to "sell" from "neutral." The broker warned that the proposed spinoffs of the group's Dia hard-discount unit and property business would lead to €1.1 billion ($1.54 billion) of direct value loss.

French electronics company  Legrand sank 5.3% after funds managed by private equity firms Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Wendel conducted the joint sale of Legrand shares. 

In Paris, the CAC 40 index lost 1% to 4020.21—1.2% for the week—weighed down by a decline in defensive utility stocks like  Veolia Environnement, down 3.7%, and GDF Suez, which fell 2.3%. Veolia posted flat annual profit and said it would accelerate divestments in the medium term. 

In Frankfurt, the DAX 30 lost 0.7% to 7178.90, but was little changed for the week, led by a 2.2% decline in  Deutsche Bank and a 1.9% drop in car maker  Daimler.

In London, the FTSE 100 index finished the day and the week down 0.2% at 5990.39. One of the top losers was advertising and media giant  WPP, which slipped 2.6%. The group reported a 34% increase in 2010 net profit and forecast organic revenue growth of around 5% this year.

Some deal news also moved shares.  Crédit Agricole declined 1% after agreeing to buy Belgian bank unit Centea from financial-services group  KBC for €527 million. KBC, which has received billions of euros in state aid to help it weather the financial crisis, was required to sell the unit by European Union regulators. The deal will significantly boost Crédit Agricole's position in Belgium. KBC shares rose 2.7%.
