AMSTERDAM—Three Dutch troops are being held in Libya after being captured during a rescue mission by forces loyal to Col. Moammar Gadhafi, a spokesman for the Dutch Ministry of Defense said Thursday. 

The incident took place Sunday near the Libyan town of Sirte, but wasn't made public until now so as not to endanger the soldiers' safety, defense ministry spokesman Otte Beeksma said. 

The captured trio are crew members of a helicopter that was on board the navy ship HMS Tromp. They tried to rescue two civilians—a Dutch citizen and one citizen of another undisclosed European country. 

Mr. Beeksma said the two civilians were released by the Libyan troops and brought to the Dutch embassy in Tripoli before leaving the country. 

The three Dutch soldiers are still being held by the Libyan troops. Diplomatic efforts to release them are continuing, Mr. Beeksma said, but he declined to provide any details for security reasons. 

The Associated Press reported officials from The Netherlands were in "intensive negotiations" with Col. Gadhafi's government to secure the marines' release.

News of the marines' detention by Col. Gadhafi came a day after antigovernment rebels fought off forces loyal to the Libyan dictator in a fierce battle for Brega, a strategic oil facility 740 kilometers east of Col. Gadhafi's stronghold in Tripoli.

Col. Gadhafi's crackdown has been the harshest in the Arab world to the wave of antigovernment protests sweeping across parts of the Middle East and North Africa. His forces are regrouping in an attempt to regain territories now controlled by opponents of his regime.
