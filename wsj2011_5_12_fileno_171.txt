India and China have little in common in the way they treat freedom of speech. But that isn't how  Google is reading the new regulations put in place by New Delhi.

Discussion over the new rules prompted Google to send a memo to India's government in February, objecting to some clauses. Last month, the regulations were enacted with few changes from the draft guidelines.

Google is worried about one main diktat: that Internet intermediaries are responsible for all objectionable content, which it defines as "harassing," "grossly harmful" or "ethnically objectionable," if they don't remove it when the government asks them to. 

The company said in a statement Wednesday that if Internet platforms are held liable for third-party content, it would lead to self-censorship and reduce the free flow of information.

It's easy to understand Google's jitters. Having fought for as free a hand as possible for operating in China, it was forced to pull back last year. India, with 90% of its population still without access to the Internet, is another lucrative market. And with Google enjoying a market share of about 85% in search queries, it has a lot to lose if things go wrong.

The new rules are a genuine cause for concern for Google and other Internet providers. They potentially would be hard to enact, given the volume of global content that can be accessed through Google, and would require huge manpower. 

New Delhi, unlike Beijing, doesn't systematically censor the Internet. Google isn't about to withdraw from India, with its growth potential. But the spat serves as a reminder of the many pitfalls ahead for Internet companies operating in the world's most populous developing markets.

Not only do they have to contend with limited infrastructure and undeveloped advertising markets, but political interference hangs over them as an ever-present threat.
