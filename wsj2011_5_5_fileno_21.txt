HONG KONGâ€”Swiss bank  UBS AG has named  Campbell Stewart as head of metals and mining across the Asia-Pacific region for investment banking, according to a person familiar with the matter. 

Mr. Stewart currently heads UBS' investment banking in Melbourne and the resources team in Australia. He will continue to be based in Australia.

A 23-year veteran with UBS, Mr. Campbell has played a leading role in over 40 mining, and oil & gas M&A and capital-raising transactions, including China Minmetals Non-ferrous Metals Co.'s buyout of Australian miner  OZ Minerals Ltd. and Chinese miner  Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. acquisition of Australia's Felix Resources Ltd. 

The role is a new one in Asia Pacific. Boutique investment bank Moelis & Co. said last month it had hired UBS banker  Patrick Loftus-Hills as a managing director for mining and metals. Mr. Loftus-Hills was previously joint head of the UBS Asian industrials group and head of natural resources at UBS for 11 years.
