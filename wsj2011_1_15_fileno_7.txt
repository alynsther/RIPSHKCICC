WASHINGTON—President Barack Obama on Saturday called on both parties to continue working in a spirit of cooperation in the wake of a shooting rampage in Arizona that claimed the lives of six people. 

Mr. Obama, speaking during his weekly radio address, said while U.S. politics can be shrill, the solidarity following the shooting shows the true character of the U.S. and "how much we depend on one another." 

The weekend shooting in Tucson, Ariz., left six dead and 14 injured, including House Democrat Gabrielle Giffords. Ms. Giffords, who was shot point-blank in the head, is in critical condition but is expected to survive. The president said the nation still has great challenges to solve, from growing the economy to shrinking the deficit. 

His radio address follows a eulogy the president gave in Tucson on Wednesday to remember those who were killed and injured during the attack. Mr. Obama used the eulogy to call for political unity and talked vividly of those who died. 

"So as business resumes, I look forward to working together in that same spirit of common cause with members of Congress from both parties--because before we are Democrats or Republicans, we are Americans," the president said in his radio address. 

Rep. Jeff Flake, a Republican from Arizona, echoed the president's theme of togetherness in the weekly Republican radio address. "While we may not agree on everything, members of Congress are bound together by a sacred oath to support and defend the Constitution," Mr. Flake said. He added, "an attack on one of us is an attack on all who serve—an attack on representative democracy itself." 

Mr. Flake also hailed the bravery of those who rushed to the aid of the victims. "We should honor those who stood up in defiance, for it was from the shadows of this evil that we saw true heroism emerge," Mr. Flake said.
