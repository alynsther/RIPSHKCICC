NEW YORKâ€”U.S. stocks climbed despite the strongest earthquake to hit Japan in at least 300 years as some companies benefited from expectations for increased demand from rebuilding efforts, while investors were also relieved that protests in Saudi Arabia were relatively orderly. 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 59.79 points, or 0.5%, to 12044.40. Industrial giants  3M

The Nasdaq Composite climbed 14.59, or 0.5%, to 2715.61, and the Standard & Poor's 500 index added 9.17, or 0.7%, to 1304.28, with its energy, materials and industrial sectors leading the ascent. 

Still, the market posted a weekly drop, with the Dow falling 1%, the S&P 500 off 1.3% and the Nasdaq down 2.5% for the week. For all three measures, it marked the second weekly decline in the past three weeks. 

The earthquake in Japan, one of the five biggest in history with a magnitude of 8.9, rocked the country's eastern coast, triggering a 30-foot tsunami that engulfed cars and buildings in its path in northern Japan. It set off tsunami warnings for 53 countries.

The quake inflicted particularly severe damage to areas facing the northern Pacific coast and caused panic around Tokyo. The natural disaster could derail the country's nascent economic recovery and increase Japan's already massive public debt, which is 200% of gross domestic product.



Japan's Nikkei Stock Average fell 1.7%, and the iShares MSCI Japan Index Fund, an exchange-traded fund that tracks Japanese stocks, shed 1.7%. U.S.-listed shares of Japanese companies also fell, with American depositary shares of  Honda Motor

 slipping 2.4% while U.S. shares of  Toyota Motor declined 2.1% and U.S. shares of  Sony shed 2.4%. 

However, U.S. investors expected that the quake wouldn't significantly hurt global economic growth. Rather, traders bet that the quake would actually drive increased demand for a host of economically sensitive companies when Japan starts to rebuild what was damaged by the quake. Among the stocks that benefited, AK Steel jumped 6.4%, Titanium Metals added 4.6%, and Fluor climbed 4.2%.

"The obvious thing would be to look at companies or sectors that may benefit from increased demand in their services or capital equipment," said  Peter Andersen, portfolio manager at Congress Asset Management Co. The likely candidates, he said, include companies involved with "earth-moving equipment, and heavy infrastructure companies."

Friday's climb in U.S. stocks was also due in part to relief that the so-called Day of Rage in Saudi Arabia was more peaceful than investors had been fearing. While hundreds of protesters took to the streets in the eastern Saudi Arabian cities of al-Hofuf and Awamiya, a day after police broke up a march in the same region, it appeared to be relatively orderly.

"It's giving the market a little bit of a breather," said  Russ Koesterich, iShares global chief investment strategist and global head of investment strategy for BlackRock Scientific Active Equities. "Saudi Arabia is the critical oil-producing company. If there's no more strife after yesterday's events, you're going to see the [oil] market pull back a little bit."

Friday's round of U.S. economic data came in mixed. U.S. retail sales rose less than expected, and consumer sentiment dropped back in early March as expectations plunged. But U.S. business sales increased in January by the largest amount in 10 months, while inventories grew more than expected as companies anticipated greater demand.
