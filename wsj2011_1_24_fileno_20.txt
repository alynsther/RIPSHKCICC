MUMBAI -- India's central bank said Monday its dominant policy aim will be to contain inflation, even though inflation is led by choking supplies and a demand-supply mismatch.

The Reserve Bank of India's monetary policy measures would have to be guided by an anti-inflationary thrust, necessary in an environment of persistent high inflation, and by the policy's expected effectiveness in a condition of entrenched supply-side pressures on inflation, it said in its October-December Macroeconomic and Monetary Development document.

While inflation is likely to soften in the coming months, the number is likely to stay elevated and above the earlier anticipated path, the RBI said.

In its December policy review, the central bank said there was an upside bias to its 5.5% inflation estimate for March.

The RBI will hold its rate-setting meeting Tuesday, where it is widely expected to raise rates.
