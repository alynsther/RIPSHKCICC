MUMBAI â€“ Indian shares fell to a near five-month low Thursday as sustained fears of rising interest rates, coupled with the expiry of January derivatives contracts, prompted a broad-based sell-off. 

The Bombay Stock Exchange's Sensitive Index fell 285.02 points, or 1.5%, to close at 18684.43 after moving between 18656.05 and 19086.69. The benchmark last closed below this level on Sept. 8, 2010. On the National Stock Exchange, the 50-stock S&P CNX Nifty lost 83.10 points, or 1.5%, to end at 5604.3.

Trading volume on the BSE fell to 33.06 billion rupees ($727 million) from Tuesday's 36.24 billion rupees. Decliners outnumbered gainers 1880 to 940, while 155 stocks were unchanged. Indian markets were closed Wednesday for a public holiday. 

Thursday's decline followed Tuesday's sharp falls, after India's central bank raised its key policy rates by 0.25 percentage point each--in line with estimates. But it also raised its inflation estimate for the end of March to 7% from 5.5% and said inflation remains the dominant concern. 

"Due to the uncertainty in the markets, investors were reluctant to carry forward their long positions, which weighed on the January expiry," said  Alex Mathews, head of research, Geojit BNP Paribas Financial Services. 

"According to initial estimates, the Nifty Futures roll-over ratio was just 55%. Usually, markets open firm on the first day of the new series. But since the sentiment is weak we might see further selling (in shares) tomorrow," he added. 

Of the 30 Sensex constituents, 28 ended lower Thursday. 

The losses were led by banks as the market feared rising interest rates would hurt credit growth and squeeze net interest margins of banks in the January-March. 

"Third-quarter interest margins have positively surprised, but the pinch is likely to come in the coming quarters. Both credit growth and net interest margins are at elevated levels and there is room for them to come down," said  Vaibhav Agrawal, vice president, Angel Broking. 

  HDFC Bank fell 1.7% to 2,052.15 rupees ahead of its October-December numbers release Thursday. ICICI Bank closed 2.1% lower at 1016.95 rupees.

The BSE realty index was the biggest sub-index loser, with DLF, the only real-estate Sensex constituent, falling 5.4% to 239.95 rupees. 

Most autos declined. Mahindra & Mahindra lost 4.9% to 733 rupees while Hero Honda closed 3.1% lower at 1724.05 rupees. But  Tata Motors was one of the few Sensex gainers, finishing up 2.5% at 1194.25 rupees. 

  Sterlite Industries declined 5.3% to 169.45 rupees after an arbitration panel ruled against the metals company's call option to buy the 49% stake it doesn't currently own in Bharat Aluminium Co. Sterlite Industries said it is considering the next course of action. 

JSW Steel fell 5% to 965.6 rupees after October-December earnings missed estimates due to high raw materials costs. 

Bharti Airtel declined on sustained worries of losing market share to competitors in the wake of the launch of mobile number portability. It closed 3.3% lower at 325.65 rupees. 

Reliance Industries, India's largest company by market capitalization, ended down 1.6% at 943 rupees while  Infosys Technologies lost 1.8% to finish at 3195.2 rupees.
