LONDON—European stocks staged a reversal from the previous session's deep losses, helped by strong earnings from U.S. banking giant J.P. Morgan Chase and some upbeat economic data.

Banking stocks in Europe put in a strong performance following the first- quarter results from J.P. Morgan Chase, which were stronger than expected.

"We view strong fixed-income trading results and rapidly improving credit quality as good news for J.P. Morgan and its peers," said Jeff Harte, an analyst with Sandler O'Neill Partners.

Deutsche Bank closed up 1.6%, while ING Groep added 1.0%. Automobile stocks rose as well, following losses in the previous session. Encouraging news from Daimler lent support. 

The company said it expects earnings to rise significantly in 2011 after demand for new cars and trucks recovered faster than anticipated last year. Daimler rose 0.6%.

Elsewhere, construction and building-material stocks rose strongly after French brokerage Exane BNP Paribas, upgraded the sector to "outperform" from "neutral." The Stoxx Europe 600 index for that sector rose 1.7%.

Overall, the Stoxx Europe 600 index added 0.7% to 278.25. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 index climbed 0.8% to 6010.44, while France's CAC-40 index rose 0.8% to 4006.23, and Germany's DAX advanced 1.1% to 7177.97. 

In early afternoon in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.1%, to 12248.21. Early gains faded despite news that in February, business inventories rose to their highest level in more than two years as companies looked to keep up with slowly rising sales. 

Elsewhere, U.S. retail sales increased broadly in March, though the gains fell slightly short of expectations. "This is a heartening set of numbers, especially as U.S. data has been going through a bit of a soft patch," said economist Rob Carnell at ING Bank.

News that euro-zone industrial production rose less than expected in February weighed on the European market. On the positive side, the U.K. labor market unexpectedly improved in the three months to February; the unemployment rate fell for the first time in five months. 

Shares of Alcatel-Lucent rallied 7.4% after Morgan Stanley upgraded the telecom-equipment firm to "overweight" from "equal-weight", saying recent checks with U.S. carriers suggest it has performed well in that market recently.

In Asia, stock markets closed higher Wednesday. Tokyo stocks gained from weakness in the Japanese yen. 

Japan's Nikkei Stock Average was up 0.9%, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 was 0.3% higher, South Korea's Kospi Composite was up 1.6% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index added 0.7%. 

In foreign-exchange trading, the euro was at $1.4483, from $1.4478 late Tuesday in New York, while the dollar was at ¥83.78, from ¥83.73.

Late in Europe, Nymex crude for May delivery was up 84 cents a barrel to $107.02 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, while gold for April delivery gained $4.90 an ounce to $1,457.80 on the Comex division of Nymex.
