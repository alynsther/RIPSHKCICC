NEW DELHI -- Oil India Ltd. will relinquish two exploration blocks in Libya due to low prospects, the state-run explorer's chairman N.M. Borah said. 

"About three weeks ago we informed Indian authorities about our intention [to relinquish the blocks]," Borah told reporters. 

Oil India is the operator of the blocks and state-run Indian Oil Corp. holds a stake in each of the blocks. 

Borah didn't provide further details about the blocks. 

According to Oil India's website, the explorer operates two onshore blocks--86 and 102(4)--in the Sirte Basin in Libya, in which it has a 50% working interest and Indian Oil has the remaining. 

Oil India also has a 25% stake in Area 95/96 of three onshore blocks--2/1, 2 and 4--in the Ghadames Basin of Libya, the website showed. 

State-owned Algerian energy company Sonatrach is the operator of these onshore exploration areas with a 50% working interest, while Indian Oil has the remaining 25% interest.
