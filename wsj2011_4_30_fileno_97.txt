The PGA Tour on Monday will go live with its first major new statistic in 15 years. The measure, "strokes gained—putting," crunches data from the Tour's ShotLink system to reveal how each player's performance on each green compares with that of other players in the same round. It will now be the Tour's primary putting statistic. The leader so far this year is Nick Watney; in 2009 and 2010 it was Luke Donald, above.

In a development with implications for the all-male Royal & Ancient Golf Club, leaders of the nearby, all-male, 168-year-old St. Andrews Golf Club in Scotland have recommended opening its club to women. Members will vote in May. The Old Course at St. Andrews hosted the Women's British Open for the first time in 2007 and will again in 2013.
