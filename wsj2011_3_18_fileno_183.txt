With the South by Southwest (SXSW) music conference in full swing, Austin, Texas, is being overrun by obscure bands striving to break through—and Kanye West. 

The multiplatinum-selling rapper is set to give a free performance around 2 a.m. Sunday with stars including John Legend. Unlike most SXSW acts, which perform in vacant lots or cave-like bars, Mr. West will perform at a decommissioned power plant (capacity: 2,500), with eight cameramen filming the set for release online.

The blockbuster performance illustrates the increasingly contradictory nature of the music conference, which launched 25 years ago as a forum for independent acts. 

Mr. West has popped up at SXSW before, in 2009, and he's among many household names who have promoted themselves there. But usually such shows are poorly kept secrets, spread by word of mouth. On Tuesday, for instance, Foo Fighters played an impromptu set at a barbecue joint.

Mr. West's appearance, by contrast, was teased weeks in advance with an online video, and instantly drew anticipation from bloggers. It's part of an effort by Vevo, the online music-video service staging Mr. West's concert, to expand. The company, co-owned by Universal Music (the rapper's label), says it received 10,000 RSVPs within an hour of the guest list's opening on Wednesday. 

At midnight, about the same time gates open for Mr. West, Hurray for the Riff Raff will be taking the stage at a downtown hotel. The unsigned band with a brooding Appalachian sound drove eight hours from its New Orleans base for a third visit to SXSW. In Austin, band members are crashing in an R.V. owned by a family member. Singer and lead songwriter Alynda Lee Segarra says Mr. West might steal some of her audience Saturday night, but she doesn't consider the rapper a competitor: "If Lucinda Williams was playing at the same time, we'd be screwed."
