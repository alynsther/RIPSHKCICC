The first man into the semifinals of the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, Calif., is No. 90-ranked Juan Martin del Potro. While the former U.S. Open champion's success may be a surprise to some, it isn't according to a new rating system developed by tennis-stats blogger Jeff Sackmann. Sackmann has picked 57 of 88 men's matches correctly, five more than picks based purely on the official ranking. The ratings at the start of the tournament had del Potro (pictured) rated above higher-seeded players such as Tomas Berdych and Andy Roddick. Both Berdych and Roddick lost on Wednesday.

Ohio State football coach Jim Tressel—at the center of an uproar over his failure to inform the school of potential rules violations last year—has voluntarily increased his suspension to five games next season. The school had originally said Tressel would sit out two games and be fined $250,000, a punishment that was widely criticized. He requested the increased penalty as the NCAA upheld its five-game suspension of five Buckeye players for selling memorabilia and receiving improper benefits.

Ukranian brothers Vitali and Wladimir Klitschko are widely viewed as the class of the heavyweight boxing division, but haven't been popular with U.S. sports fans. When Vitali defends his WBC belt this Saturday against Cuba's Odlanier Solis, it will be the first bout featuring a Klitschko brother on U.S. television since 2009. The fight will be shown on cable channel Epix, via webcast on the company's website and live on the Times Square jumbotron in New York City.
