MUMBAI â€“ India's central bank Friday asked banks to ensure proper end use of funds lent after a regulatory review revealed various shortcomings that have led to the unsanctioned diversion of funds by borrowers in some cases. 

The directive comes in light of a series of allegations on lending by banks to telecom and real-estate companies that raised questions over the final use of funds. 

"Effective monitoring of the end use of funds lent is of critical importance in safeguarding a bank's interest," the Reserve Bank of India said in a statement. 

The shortcomings include crediting term loan disbursements to the current or cash credit accounts of borrowers, which were later utilized for day-to-day operations, and exclusive reliance on certificates of chartered accountants on the use of funds, the RBI said. 

The central bank has asked banks to carry out post-sanction supervision of loans and carry out scrutiny of periodical progress reports of the operating and financial statements of borrowers. 

Banks should carry out regular visits to the units and inspect securities that have been hypothecated to the banks, it said. 

The lenders should seek a certificate from borrowers on the end-use of funds and in the case of incorrect certification should take prompt action by either withdrawing the loan facility or taking legal measures, it said. 

"This would also act as a deterrent for borrowers to misuse the credit facilities sanctioned, and in the process, help build a healthy credit culture in the Indian banking system," it said.
