A federal grand jury returned what authorities called an "initial" three-count indictment against  Jared Lee Loughner for allegedly trying to assassinate Congresswoman  Gabrielle Giffords and attempting to murder two of her aides.

The indictment is the latest legal development resulting from the shooting spree in Tucson on Jan. 8 in which six people were killed and fourteen wounded. Mr. Loughner, who was taken into custody at the scene of the shooting, was previously charged in a five-count criminal complaint that alleged he murdered two federal officials, Federal Judge  John Roll and Giffords aide  Gabriel Zimmerman. 

The shootings took place at a public meeting being hosted by Rep. Giffords, whom authorities believe was the main target of the attack.

Authorities indicated that Wednesday's indictment would be followed by at least one more involving the deaths of Judge Roll and Mr. Zimmerman.  Dennis Burke, the U.S. Attorney in Arizona, in a prepared statement noted that since the case also involves potential death-penalty charges, Justice Department rules "require us to pursue a deliberate and thorough process. Today's charges are just the beginning of our legal action." 

The penalty for attempting to assassinate a member of Congress is up to life imprisonment. The attempted murder counts carry up to 20 year penalties.

In cases where a criminal complaint is initially filed, that action is commonly followed up by an indictment where prosecutors present their evidence to a grand jury, which decides whether there is enough evidence to proceed.

Mr. Loughner, who remains in custody, hasn't yet entered a plea. His attorneys couldn't immediately be reached for comment. In the past his lawyers have consistently declined to comment.
