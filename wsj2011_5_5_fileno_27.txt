MUMBAI â€“ Indian shares fell for a ninth straight session Thursday, their longest losing streak in a decade, as foreign funds stepped up selling due to concerns about the economy's growth prospects amid persistent inflation and higher commodity prices. 

The Bombay Stock Exchange's Sensitive Index slipped 258.78 points, or 1.4%, to close at 18210.58, after moving between 18160.65 and 18569.21. On the National Stock Exchange, the 50-stock S&P CNX Nifty lost 77.30 points, or 1.4%, to end at 5459.85. 

Trading volume on the BSE edged up to 27.34 billion rupees ($616 million) from Wednesday's 27.13 billion rupees. Gainers lagged decliners 867 to 1,931, while 128 stocks were unchanged. 

Analysts say foreign funds seem to have turned bearish on the economy following the Reserve Bank of India's decision Tuesday to raise its lending rate by a sharper-than-expected one-half percentage point. The central bank also said reining in inflation is the top priority even if there are some short-term costs by way of lower economic growth. 

Foreign funds had net sold Indian shares worth $323 million in May as of Wednesday, bringing down their net purchases in 2011 to $774.4 million. In contrast, foreign institutions had pumped in a record $29 billion into Indian equities in 2010. 

"All corporate earnings released so far show the impact of inflation in the form of higher raw material expenses and increased employee costs," said  Anish Jhaveri, chief executive of Antique Finance. "Confidence among buyers is shaken." 

Analysts expect the markets to remain weak in coming sessions with investors using minor rallies in large-caps to take profit. 

All but three of the 30 Sensex constituents ended lower Thursday. 

Losses were led by banks as investors used Wednesday's modest gains to take profit. ICICI Bank closed down 2.8% at 1,028.30 rupees and  HDFC Bank slid 1.8% to 2,220.25 rupees. 

Bharti Airtel pulled telecom stocks lower after the company missed net profit estimates for the January-March quarter due to a jump in interest expenses and lower-than-expected revenue from its Africa business. The stock closed off 3.3% at 357.60 rupees. Reliance Communications slumped 5.5% to 89.05 rupees.

Other Sensex losers included Tata Power, which fell 5.2% to 1,228.75 rupees, and Reliance Infrastructure, down 4.2% at 616.60 rupees.

Among non-Sensex laggards, Ranbaxy Laboratories dropped 6.0% to 426.40 rupees following a media report that the company may have to face fines exceeding $1 billion to resolve outstanding regulatory issues in the U.S. A Ranbaxy spokesman declined to comment on the report. 

Motorcycle maker Hero Honda Motors--up 6.1% at 1,697.90 rupees--stood out among the handful of gainers after the company clarified on royalty payments to its erstwhile partner,  Honda Motor Co.
