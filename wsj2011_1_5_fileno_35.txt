In a case that could strain trade relations between U.S. and China, the U.S. Department of Commerce is levying a nearly 70% antidumping duty on imported Chinese-made oil drill pipes, saying that they were selling below fair market value. 

The department's final ruling also determined that China was unfairly subsidizing its steel industry, which gave it an unfair competitive advantage over U.S. producers. Commerce is imposing a countervailing duty of 18.18% to address the subsidizing portion of the trade case. Chinese embassy officials and officials from Chinese steelmakers cited in the case couldn't immediately be reached for comment.

The Commerce Department's final determination comes just two weeks before China's president, Hu Jintao, visits Washington to discuss, in part, trade agreements. 

The case was brought by smaller U.S. pipe manufacturers and the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union, also known as the AFL-CIO-CLC.

The Chinese pipe producers exported about $119 million of the dumped and subsidized pipe in 2009. The drill pipes are generally used on both offshore and onshore rigs drilling for oil and natural gas. Drilling contractors such as  Transocean Ltd.

 and Patterson-UTI, as opposed to oil and natural gas companies, purchase this type of pipe. 

The pipes, depending on their uses, can sell for $3,000 to $6,000 a short ton, making them one of the highest-priced steel pipe products. 

The next step in the case goes before the U.S, International Trade Commission, which will decide whether the U.S. steel makers have been injured by the dumped and subsidized pipe. That final determination is scheduled for Feb. 17.
