DUBAIâ€”Ratings agency Moody's Wednesday downgraded Egypt's sovereign bond ratings by one notch to Ba3, from Ba2, due to prolonged political uncertainty in the Arab republic and the adverse impact this is having on the country's fiscal position and broader economic performance. 

Moody's said to Zawya Dow Jones that the deterioration of the political situation in Libya also has negative implications for Egypt's economy and security. The outlook on the bond ratings remains negative, it added. 

The company also downgraded the country ceiling for foreign currency bonds to Ba1 from Baa3 and the country ceiling for foreign currency bank deposits to B1 from Ba3. 

Moody's said the primary driver of its downgrade of Egypt's sovereign bond ratings is the continued volatility in the country's domestic politics in the wake of the ousting of former president, Hosni Mubarak, in February. 

"Although the country's Higher Military Council has outlined a timetable for transition to a civilian government, the process is fraught with uncertainty," it said. 

This extended period of political disturbance undermines Egypt's institutional strength and raises event risk, at least over the short term, said Moody's. Over the longer term, it remains to be seen whether an effective and stable government will be formed at the end of the announced transition phase, it added. 

Egypt's ratings do however continue to be supported by a number of important factors such as a still substantial stock of official foreign exchange reserves, a well-diversified economy and a favourable public debt structure with little marketable foreign currency sovereign debt, Moody's said.
