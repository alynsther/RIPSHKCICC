 STEP ONE: Assemble the branches and greenery

Create a base for your arrangement with branches and greenery, as seen at right. Here we used dogwood, rose geranium and mint. Let the branches reach up and beyond the lip of the vase. The shape should be airy and playful. 

 STEP TWO: Add flowers and wispy elements

Add the flowers. Here we used peonies (duchess de nemours and Charlie's white). Don't be afraid to cut the flowers at different lengthsâ€”nestle some blooms in deeper while letting others rise above. Pepper the arrangement with delicate elements such at dainty columbine flowers, oregano sprigs and wispy astilbe. Finish it off with a grand gesture of a single vine tumbling onto the table.
