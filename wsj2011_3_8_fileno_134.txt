The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 124.35 points, or 1%, to finish at 12214.38, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 11.69 points, or 0.9%, to 1321.82. The Nasdaq Composite gained 20.14 points, or 0.7%, to 2765.77.

The Dow's strong gains pushed the blue-chip index back to just short of where it started the month, recouping most of the previous two days' losses of 168 points. The gain was the blue-chip index's third day of triple-digit gains this year.

Bank of America's gains came after Chief Executive  Brian Moynihan said he believes the bank has the ability to earn between $35 billion and $40 billion a year in pretax earnings when the business normalizes. Speaking at the bank's first investor-day conference since 2007, Mr. Moynihan said the bank has no intention of making more acquisitions and will instead look to cut costs and focus on customers.

Mr. Moynihan said the bank was focused on returning "every dollar" in capital to shareholders through regular dividends, share buybacks and special cash dividends.

Said  Mickey Cargile, managing partner of WNB Private Client Services in Midland, Texas: "It's just a prime time to be in banking—with such a steep yield curve, that's designed to drive profits to banks, allowing banks to borrow cheaply and lend higher." Investor concern over regulatory restraints on the banking sector was "overdone."

"There has been quite a bit of attention paid to the bad side of banking without really paying attention to the facts—banks can make bigger spreads than they normally do," he said.

Not everyone was convinced of banks' prospects. "In an economy that's still in a deleveraging mode, I really view the commercial-banking sector as one that essentially has no organic growth prospects," said  Howard Ward, chief investment officer of growth equities at Gamco. "They can take market share from one another, but it's an industry facing no growth and a lot of regulations that haven't been sorted out yet."

Weighing on the market was McDonald's, off 75 cents, or 1%, to 75.54 after the fast-food chain reported that same-store sales rose by a better-than-expected 3.9% in February, though results in its U.S. restaurants missed Wall Street's expectations.

Energy stocks were also weak, as crude prices fell in volatile trading. Reports that more countries may step in to boost production and that Libya's Col. Gadhafi may be looking for a way to step down helped cheer the market, pushing crude oil to an intraday low of $103.33 a barrel. But as forces loyal to Col. Gadhafi launched a new round of attacks on rebel positions, crude oil retraced some of its declines. Crude oil for April delivery finished at $105.02, off 0.4%.

Even so, concerns across the volatile Middle East and North Africa region continued to weigh on investors' minds. Mr. Ward of Gamco said he was worried about a scheduled "day of rage" protest on Friday in Saudi Arabia. "I don't see how it goes smoothly," he said. "Protests there are against the law, and if that happens, I don't see how that does not support higher oil prices." He was also concerned about Libya, warning that even the removal of Col. Gadhafi could leave a fractured country with different parts of the oil infrastructure split between separate tribes.

The economic calendar was fairly quiet Tuesday, though a survey of small businesses showed more firms are planning to raise their selling prices and increase hiring.
