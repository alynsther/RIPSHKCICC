The company, controlled by Macau gambling magnate  Stanley Ho, said its net profit for the 12 months ended Dec. 31 was 3.56 billion Hong Kong dollars (US$456.6 million), up from HK$906.7 million a year earlier. 

The result was higher than the average HK$3.21 billion forecast of 10 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.
