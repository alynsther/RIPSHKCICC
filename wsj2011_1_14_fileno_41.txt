Some of English football's biggest rivalries will be on show this week as the Premier League resumes following a two-week break.

West Ham United hosts Arsenal on Saturday and despite being bottom of the 20-team top division, the Hammers have lost just once in five league games, winning three of its past four matches in all competitions.

Arsenal is third in the standings, although the Gunners have been wracked by inconsistency: On Wednesday, the club suffered a surprise defeat to Ipswich, of the second division, in the Carling Cup. Given the team's unpredictable form, there's a case for laying Ars√®ne Wenger's side at 4/6 on Betdaq, ensuring a payout in the event of a home win or draw. 

In the Midlands, Aston Villa crosses England's second city to face Birmingham on Sunday. The home team has lost just four Premier League games at St Andrew's since the beginning of last season and is a good bet to win here at 6/4. Villa has lost seven of its last nine.

Sunderland should bounce back from the 5-1 drubbing it received at Newcastle in October and justify its status as 6/5 favorite in the North-East derby. Sunderland has lost just once in front of its own fans.

In the North-West, Liverpool welcomes Everton to Anfield on Sunday with both sides in unfamiliar positions close to the foot of the standings. Kenny Dalglish, Liverpool's new coach, has lost both games since taking over from Roy Hodgson and it's hard to back his side at 5/4. Instead go for a resurgent Everton to win at 13/5.
