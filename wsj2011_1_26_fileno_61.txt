For a space often associated with power ties and power suits, there's a welcome playfulness at Casa Lever, the Northern Italian restaurant at the Lever House building.

Casa Lever, the second restaurant in that spot, retains the space-age feel. Angular pods serve as booths and the dining room feels a bit like the front of a jumbo jet. 



The new team, who also runs Sant Ambroeus, has brightened the place with small café tables up front and chandeliers. The walls include a rotation of Warhol originals on canvas from the Lever House collection,  Aretha Franklin and  Alfred Hitchcock, among others. 

The chefs prepare faithful renditions of regional classics. Try the flavorful Dover sole, or the tasty veal Milanese pounded wide enough to fill the whole plate. Yet the steep lunch prices—even the prix fixe costs $39 for two items—remind you it's still a power lunch experience.

 Casa Lever, 390 Park Ave., serves lunch Monday to Saturday from 11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m.; 212-888-2700.
