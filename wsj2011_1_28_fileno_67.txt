Arizona lawmakers proposed legislation Thursday designed to deny automatic U.S. citizenship to the children of illegal immigrants. 

The legislation, filed in tandem in the Arizona House and Senate, would require the state to create separate birth certificates for children who are deemed to be Arizona citizens and for those who are not. State Republican Sen. Ron Gould and Republican Rep. John Kavanagh are the primary sponsors of the bills, which received support from other lawmakers. Lawmakers from about a dozen states are expected to consider similar birthright citizenship legislation this year. 

States have the authority to issue birth certificates. But because citizenship is a federal issue, issuing a different birth certificate for U.S-born children of illegal immigrants will likely generate federal lawsuits.

Arizona legislators determined to crack down on illegal immigration have said they hope to force the U.S. Supreme Court to consider whether the 14th Amendment applies to U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants. The amendment, ratified in 1868, states that "all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside."

According to the Pew Hispanic Center, an independent think tank, about 340,000 children were born in the U.S. to undocumented immigrants in 2008, the latest year for which data are available. This accounted for 8% of all births.
