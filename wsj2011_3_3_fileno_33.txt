LONDON— BP PLC said Thursday it won't pay bonuses for 2010 to top executives who had responsibility during a fatal oil-well explosion in the Gulf of Mexico, but will pay reduced bonuses to two who met specific targets in their divisions. 

Former Chief Executive  Tony Hayward, former head of Exploration and Production  Andy Inglis and current Chief Executive  Robert Dudley will receive no cash bonus for 2010 and no shares under the long-term remuneration plan running from 2008 to 2010, BP said in its annual report to shareholders. 

Head of refining  Iain Conn and Chief Financial Officer  Byron Grote will receive cash bonuses of £104,000 ($169,800) and $207,000 respectively for meeting targets within their own division. This is around 10% of the cash bonuses they received in 2009. 

"The remuneration committee shared the group chief executive's view that no bonuses should be paid on group-level results," in the wake of the Macondo well blowout, which killed 11 men and triggered a huge oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. 

Salaries for board members remained broadly unchanged from 2009 to 2010, excluding Mr. Dudley, whose basic pay increased to $1.18 million from $750,000 in 2009 as he became CEO. 

Separately, BP said oil production in its two main deep water areas, the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Angola, fell by 15% in 2010 to 508,000 barrels a day. 

These figures, released in its annual report, highlight how the fatal Deepwater Horizon blowout and subsequent oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico have hurt the company's deep water operations, which accounted for a fifth of total oil output in 2010 and were to underpin much of the company's future growth. 

BP said its total Gulf of Mexico deep water oil production fell to 338,000 barrels a day, from 387,000 barrels a day in 2009. 

In Angola, where BP has suffered a number of technical problems, production fell to 170,000 barrels a day in 2010, from 211,000 barrels a day the previous year. 

BP's total oil production in 2010 fell 6.4% to 2.374 million barrels a day, the company said.
