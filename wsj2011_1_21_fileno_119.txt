Poor New Jersey. These are dark times in Garden State sports, possibly the darkest ever. (Unless you include the Jersey-based New York Jets and Giants—which, as any New Yorker will tell you, don't count.)

There are five prominent teams that are truly identified with New Jersey: the Devils, Nets, Seton Hall men's basketball, and Rutgers football and basketball. With apologies to the Rutgers basketball team, which is a respectable 10-7 through Wednesday, they're all in rough shape. This is looking like the first time in 15 years that all five Jersey teams will miss the postseason, and quite possibly the second time ever that all five finished below .500. (Rutgers's record figures to dip as the Scarlet Knights, who went 9-3 in nonconference play, proceed through the unforgiving Big East schedule.)

Just a few years ago, New Jersey was on the rise. In 2000, the Devils won the Stanley Cup while Seton Hall coach Tommy Amaker hauled in one of college basketball's top recruiting classes. In 2003, the Nets and the Devils played in the NHL and NBA finals at the same time. In 2006, Rutgers football was 9-0 and ranked No. 7 nationally at one point.

But Jersey's teams have since regressed—stunningly so this season, with Rutgers football going 4-8 and even the reliable Devils falling apart. Despite a recent uptick, the Devils were on pace for a 50-point decline through Wednesday, which would be the largest in NHL history. The Nets are last in their division and the Pirates (2-5) and Knights (1-4) are struggling in conference play. If only the Jets would just put "Jersey" in their name.
