NEW YORKâ€”A U.S. citizen who hijacked a flight from New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport in 1968 and fled to Cuba was sentenced to 15 years in prison on Tuesday.

Luis Armando Pena Soltren, 67 years old, admitted last March to hijacking a Pan American plane along with three other men about two hours into the flight in November 1968. During his plea, Mr. Pena Soltren said he held a small knife to the throat of a flight attendant to gain control of the plane and carried a loaded pistol that was incapable of firing.

On Tuesday, Mr. Pena Soltren said he was "guided by a lack of experience, a lack of patience and a lack of maturity." He said he agreed to join the plot in 1968 because he wanted to travel to Cuba to visit his father, who had been injured. 

"I also want to apologize to all those people who felt threatened during my desperate action," Mr. Pena Soltren said through an interpreter.

Mr. Pena Soltren, a native of Puerto Rico, voluntarily returned to the U.S. in October 2009 and pleaded guilty in March to conspiracy, interference with flight-crew members and kidnapping. He had faced as much as life in prison on the charges.

His wife lives in the U.S. and he has four daughters. His lawyer said Mr. Pena Soltren had sought to return to the U.S. since 1979, but was only allowed recently to return.

Two men pleaded guilty to criminal charges in the hijacking after being apprehended in the mid-1970s. A third man, Alejandro Figueroa, was acquitted in a bench trial in 1969.
