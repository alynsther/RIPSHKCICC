LONDON—European stocks closed higher after fluttering between gains and losses for much of the session. Caution prevailed ahead of a vote in the Portuguese parliament on new austerity measures aimed at averting a financial bailout. 

Continued concern about developments in Japan and Libya also limited gains. 

Resource issues put in the best performance. The Stoxx Europe 600 index for the sector rose 2% to 583.63 as metals prices rose. 

The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 index closed up 0.5% at 273.11, while the U.K.'s's FTSE 100 index was 0.6% higher at 5795.88, Frankfurt's DAX index was up 0.4% at 6804.45 and Paris's CAC-40 index gained 0.4% to 3913.73. 

As European markets closed, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.2% at 12047.23, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was off 0.1% at 1292.81. 

Euro-zone debt woes were at the forefront of investors' minds Wednesday, as the Portuguese government and opposition prepared to vote. Portugal's benchmark stock index fell 0.9% to 2786.45, building on a 1.5% decline on Tuesday.

Traders noted worries that the main opposition party was due to vote against the plan. Such an outcome, said Prime Minister  Jose Socrates, could lead to his resignation. 

"This is certainly troubling, and may mean that due attention returns to fiscal fights in the euro zone...We would suggest that these may continue to drag on markets and especially the euro," said  Gerard Lane, strategist at Shore Capital. 

Banco BPI fell 3% and Banco Comercial Portugues slipped 1.6%.

At the same time, concern about Japan's nuclear crisis shifted from the stability of the reactors to the impact of the radiation release into food and water. Events this week in Libya have made it increasingly unlikely that Libyan oil production will return to normal in the near term, said Deutsche Bank. 

In London, U.K. supermarket chain J. Sainsbury fell 5.4% after it failed to meet market expectations in the most recent quarter. The miner  Eurasian Natural Resources Corp. surged 3.5% in London after saying its full-year net profit more than doubled from the preceding year.
