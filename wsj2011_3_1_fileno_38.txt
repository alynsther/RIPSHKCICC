NEW DELHI â€“Most Indian auto makers Tuesday posted higher vehicle sales for February as customers, expecting a price increase in March, advanced purchases. 

The auto industry was expecting the federal government to raise excise tax, levied at vehicle dispatches from factories, in its budget for the next fiscal year that starts April 1. A tax increase would have forced auto makers to raise vehicle prices. But the budget, announced Monday, kept the tax unchanged. 

The government had cut excise tax by six percentage points in 2008 and 2009 after the global economic slowdown stifled demand for new vehicles. The tax was raised by two percentage points to 10% on Feb. 28, 2010. 

Auto sales are also benefiting from the introduction of new vehicles, easier availability of loans and higher personal incomes. 

Maruti Suzuki India Ltd., TVS Motor Co. Ltd., Tata Motors Ltd., Hero Honda Motors Ltd., Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. and the Indian units of Ford Motor Co., Nissan Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. all posted higher sales as demand continued to grow at a record pace. 

Maruti, the Indian unit of Suzuki Motor Corp. (7269.TO), said total vehicle sales climbed 16% to 111,645 units in February from 96,650 a year earlier. 

Sales of Maruti small cars--including the Alto, A-Star, WagonR and Swift--grew 19% to 72,090 vehicles, while sales of sedans SX4 and Dzire surged 27% to 13,024 vehicles. 

Exports, however, fell 15% to 10,102 vehicles. 

"Dealers also bought more cars in anticipation of higher taxes," said Deepak Jain, auto analyst with brokerage firm Sharekhan Ltd. 

He said automobile sales are expected to remain robust in March as well. 

Tata Motors, India's biggest auto maker by revenue, saw total sales of cars, sport-utility vehicles, trucks and buses climb 12% to 77,543 units from 69,427 a year earlier. Local sales were up 10% at 73,039 units.

Car and SUV sales rose 18% to 31,909 units, while truck and bus sales grew 5% to 41,130 vehicles. The company said sales of the Nano minicar more than doubled in February to 8,262. 

Shares of auto makers surged on the higher February sales. TVS shares gained as much as 12.61%, but pared gains to close 11.03% up at 56.35 rupees ($1.25) on the Bombay Stock Exchange. Maruti shares closed 7.14% higher at 1,292.9 rupees, while those of Tata Motors rose 5.42% to 1,140.4 rupees and Mahindra jumped 8.36% to 665.45 rupees. They outpaced a 3.5% rise in the main index.
