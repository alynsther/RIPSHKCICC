When the New England Patriots defeated the New York Jets, 45-3, late in the regular season, Jets coach Rex Ryan called it "the biggest butt-whipping I've ever taken."

Mr. Ryan may need to brace himself for another. Playoff rematches of NFL regular-season blowouts have usually resulted in another blowout: The five teams that beat an eventual playoff opponent by 35 points or more in the regular season went on to win again by double digits in the postseason. The 42 points by which the Patriots beat the Jets on Dec. 6 is the third-widest margin in history for teams that would then meet in the playoffs.

The Jets themselves are on the positive side of this blowout list: In last year's regular-season finale, they beat the Cincinnati Bengals, 37-0, and then beat them by 10 points the next week in the playoffs. 

The Jets and Patriots will become the 30th pair of teams to meet in the playoffs after each beating the other in a home game in the regular season. But even this number favors New England: Home teams have gone 17-12 in playoff rubber matches when this has happened.
