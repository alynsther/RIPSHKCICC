As greatness continues to elude Joba Chamberlain and Phil Hughes remains on the lookout for his missing fastball, a slew of Yankee castoffs are actually thriving in smaller markets. A Yankee fan can't help but wonder if the team held on to the right pitching prospects.

Perhaps the most striking success story is that of Nationals setup man Tyler Clippard. He won three games for New York in 2007 but was traded that offseason for another reliever, Jonathan Albaladejo. (Albaladejo compiled a 4.70 ERA in parts of three years with the Yankees and was released in November.) Since going to Washington, Clippard has gone 16-11 with a 2.84 ERA (through Wednesday).

Then there's Ian Kennedy, a former first-round draft pick once expected to join Chamberlain and Hughes in a powerful Yankee rotation. He has found a home in Arizona after being traded as part of the Curtis Granderson deal, pitching to a 3.82 ERA in 233 innings for the Diamondbacks. Hughes has a 4.73 ERA in 186 2/3 innings during the same span.

And the list continues: Jeff Karstens, who was traded for Damaso Marte and Xavier Nady in 2008, is 2-1 with a 4.05 ERA for Pittsburgh this year. Mark Melancon, who was traded for Lance Berkman last year, has a 1.72 ERA in a league-most 18 games for Houston. Michael Dunn, a lefthander the Yanks dealt for Javier Vazquez in 2009, has allowed just four earned runs in 37 relief appearances in the past two seasons. Even Ross Ohlendorf, who went 1-11 for the Pirates last season, has had an above-average adjusted ERA the past two years.

Instead, the Yankees are left with Hughes and Chamberlain—two pitchers looking less and less likely to ever live up to their extraordinary expectations.
