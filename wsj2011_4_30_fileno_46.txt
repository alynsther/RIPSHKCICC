PHILADELPHIA -- A road trip that began with the promise of a growing win streak suddenly has the potential to turn ugly for the Mets. The Philadelphia Phillies routed the Mets 10-3 Friday at Citizens Bank Park. And the weekend may only get worse, with Roy Halladay starting Saturday and Cliff Lee on Sunday. Mike Pelfrey allowed four runs on eight hits in 4 1/3 innings, while the Mets managed only two hits in six innings against Vance Worley. Ryan Howard drove in six runs with two homers for the Phillies, including a grand slam off Dillon Gee in the sixth.

On a night of ugly baseball, it's hard to tell which was the biggest missed opportunity in the Yankees' 5-3 loss. 

It could have come in the fifth inning, when a Toronto error allowed the lucky Yankees to avoid a potential triple play, and load the bases with nobody out—only to promptly strand all three runners. And on it went.

Robinson Cano did his best to keep his team in the game with two homers, but he had no help. 

The Yankees later loaded the bases in the eighth—just in time for a Derek Jeter strikeout and a Nick Swisher groundout. Rally over.
