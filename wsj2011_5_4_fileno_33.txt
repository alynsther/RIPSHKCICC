Stocks retreated under pressure from disappointing economic data, weaker commodity prices and lackluster earnings reports.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 83.93 points, or 0.7%, to 12723.58. The Nasdaq Composite shed 13.39 points, or 0.5%, to 2828.23. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 9.30 points, or 0.7%, to 1347.32, following drops on the first two days of the month as well.

The S&P 500 index's negative start to the month follows a strong April, and marks the first time the index has declined over the first three trading sessions of a month since October 2008.

Economic data weighed on shares. The Institute for Supply Management's index of nonmanufacturing activity for April came in below expectations. Automatic Data Processing reported that private-sector jobs in the U.S. rose 179,000 in April, missing economists' forecast. The government on Friday will release its monthly employment report. 

"There's a general malaise around what the next order of economic activity will be," said  Mitch Rubin, chief investment officer at RiverPark Advisors.
