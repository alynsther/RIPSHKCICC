MUMBAI â€“ India's coffee exports in 2010 jumped 56% from the previous year to an all-time high of 292,550 metric tons, driven by better output and firm overseas demand. 

Coffee exports from India, Asia's third-largest producer, recovered sharply due to a revival in demand post the global economic slowdown. 

The country exported 187,326 tons of coffee in 2009, down from 213,158 tons in the previous year. 

In 2010, India's arabica exports surged 71.4% to 51,398 tons, while robusta shipments rose 63.2% to 157,006 tons, the state-run Coffee Board said Monday. 

Exports of instant coffee during the year increased nearly 38% to 83,887 tons. 

Arabica is mainly used in premium coffees, while Robusta is blended with arabica beans for a lower-cost option for brewed or processed instant coffee. 

But low carryover stocks from 2010 and firm prices may hurt exports this year, industry officials said. 

"Last year it was at an all-time high, which we won't be able to match this year," said  Ramesh Rajah, president of the Coffee Exporters Association of India. 

Demand from overseas markets are low now due to of New Year holidays, Rajah said, adding that the situation may improve from next week. 

According to the Coffee Board, India is likely to produce 299,000 tons of coffee in the crop year that began Oct. 1, down from its June forecast of an all-time high production of 308,000 tons. 

The value of total coffee exported from India rose to $644.89 million in 2010, up from $408.26 million in the previous year, Coffee Board data showed. 

The country produced 289,600 tons of coffee in the 2009-10 crop year, up 10.4% from the previous year. 

India exports about two-thirds of its production. Italy, Russia, Germany and Belgium together account for more than 50% of India's coffee shipments.
