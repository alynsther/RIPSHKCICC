MUMBAI â€“ Indian shares closed lower for the third straight session Friday as continued selling by foreign institutions pulled down Reliance Industries and several other large-cap stocks. 

Foreign funds have net sold stocks worth $924.04 million until Thursday in 2001, compared with inflows of $29.36 billion in 2010. They sold a net 16.5 billion rupees of Indian stocks Thursday, according to provisional data on the stock exchanges. The final data for Thursday and provisional numbers for Friday will be available later in the day. 

The Bombay Stock Exchange's Sensitive Index fell 288.46 points, or 1.5%, to close at 18395.97 after moving between 18235.45 and 18723.12. The benchmark, which has lost 755.31 points, or 3.9%, over the past three sessions, last closed below this level on Sept. 3. 

Trading volume on the BSE rose to 38.94 billion rupees ($855.5 million) from Thursday's 33.06 billion rupees. Gainers lagged decliners 517 to 2369, while 123 stocks were unchanged. 

On the National Stock Exchange, the 50-stock S&P CNX Nifty fell 92.15 points, or 1.6%, to end at 5,512.15. 

"The market recovered slightly toward the end, but we saw some basket-selling by foreign institutions, likely driven by India's weak macro indicators," said  Vikas Khemani, executive vice-president and head of institutional equities at Edelweiss Capital. 

"There might be a slight bounce in coming days after the recent sharp falls, but the market continues to look weak," he added. 

The market's latest losing streak started Tuesday, after the Reserve Bank of India increased its key policy rates by 0.25 percentage point --in line with estimates--but raised its inflation estimate for end-March to 7% from 5.5% and said inflation remained its dominant concern. The shares fell again on Thursday, when it opened after the Republic Day holiday. 

Of the 30 Sensex constituents, 22 ended lower Friday. 

Sensex losses were led by Reliance Industries, India's largest company by market capitalization, which fell 3% to 914.5 rupees, analysts said. 

Auto shares extended losses on fear that rising interest rates, high fuel prices and soaring raw-material costs will hurt profits in the coming quarters. 

"There are fears that the auto industry will not be able to maintain last year's robust growth rate and the stocks could remain weak in the absence of positive triggers," said  Vaishali Jajoo, an analyst at Angel Broking. 

Mahindra & Mahindra fell 4.9% to 696.85 rupees, while  Tata Motors closed 4.1% lower at 1145.7 rupees. 

Real-estate stocks fell sharply for the third straight day with DLF, the only real-estate stock in the Sensex, closing 7% down at 223.1 rupees.

Among other decliners, Larsen & Toubro fell 2.7% to 1606.05 rupees, while Housing Development Finance Corp. closed 2.8% lower at 647.45 rupees. 

The weakness in large-cap stocks spread to the rest of the market with the mid cap and small caps sub-indexes falling 2.7% and 3.6%, respectively. 

Sensex's gainers were led by Oil & Natural Gas Corp., which rose after saying late Thursday the company has discovered shale gas at a pilot project in the eastern Indian state of West Bengal. ONGC said it is the first such find in outside of North America. 

The stock closed 1.9% higher at 1135.6 rupees, ahead of reporting its October-December results later Friday. 

  HDFC Bank rose 0.3% to 2058.35 rupees after posting better-than-expected fiscal third-quarter results late Thursday.
