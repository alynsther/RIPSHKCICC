For a celebration of an art institution as supposedly outlandish as the Kitchen, the entertainment at its 40th anniversary gala at Capitale was surprisingly conservative.

 A video introduced the venue as a center historically for "the crazies," but Wednesday's party featured dignified stagings of soft jazz, classical violin and a flute piece.

Even the decor was relatively conventional: For the first time, there were kitchen-themed centerpieces.

The downtown crowd seemed to enjoy themselves, even if they were a little detached from the actual performance space. 

The actor, designer and global ambassador Waris Ahluwalia, for instance, couldn't remember the specific works he'd seen there. "You never know what you're going to get. You could walk out smiling or confused, or angry," he said, vaguely.

"It's like mystery meat."

The evening's honoree Philip Glass, however, recounted a poetry reading by John Cage at the Kitchen: "It emptied out the house."
