MOSCOWâ€”Russia's central bank Monday moved to tighten monetary policy, as new data showed Russia's economy grew faster than expected.

Russia's gross domestic product grew by 4.0% in 2010, an estimate from the Federal Statistics Service showed Monday, coming in slightly above the 3.8% forecast mentioned earlier this month by Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. The Economy Ministry estimates that GDP grew at 4.5% last year, an official told Russian news agencies on Monday.

The "clearly very good" figures indicate that the economy grew at a high rate in the fourth quarter, possibly due to an improving trade balance amid a weaker ruble and a recovery in investment, UniCredit SpA analyst  Vladimir Osakovskiy said.

Meanwhile, Russia's central bank said Monday it left interest rates on hold at its monthly policy- setting meeting, citing accelerating inflation and the risk of rising capital inflows because of the country's oil exports. 

Despite keeping key rates unchanged, the regulator took steps to reduce inflation pressures. It raised bank-reserve acquirements and reduced the bonds that banks can use for collateral in so-called lombard-auction loans of up to one year.

The Bank of Russia's new policy "affirms the fact that the central bank is 'light' on inflation and always cares more about growth, especially at a time when we are heading into elections," said Tim Ash, an economist at RBS. 

Consumer prices grew by 8.8% last year, overshooting central-bank targets by as much as 50% as food prices surged because of a crippling summer drought.
