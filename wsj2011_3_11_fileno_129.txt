NEW YORKâ€”Gold futures rose modestly as investors mulled the consequences of a major earthquake that hit Japan.

The most actively traded contract, for April delivery, rose $9.30, or 0.7%, to settle at $1,421.80 a troy ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. The nearby March contract also gained $9.30, to $1,421.50. 

The metal edged higher throughout the day after an 8.9-magnitude earthquake rocked Japan on Friday, triggering a 32-foot tsunami, forcing tens of thousands of people to evacuate their homes and setting off tsunami warnings for 53 countries around the world. 

"Investors aren't sure how this is going to play out," said  Michael Gross, a broker and futures analyst with OptionSellers.com. "In times of uncertainty, you buy gold."

Gold is considered a refuge asset because it isn't as linked to manufacturing cycles as more industrial commodities or equities.

The metal is also considered an alternative to the U.S. dollar and was helped Friday as the quake sent the yen sharply higher as nervous companies and investors sent funds back home, shifting out of the dollar and the U.S. government bond market. 

The weaker dollar supported gold by making the dollar-denominated metal less expensive for buyers using other currencies, goosing demand.
