Japan's stock market plummeted more than 14% yesterday, before rebounding to close with a 10.5% loss. That came on top of a 6% fall on Monday, meaning that some $626 billion in value has been wiped off the share prices of Japanese companies so far this week. To his credit, Economy Minister Kaoru Yosano has ruled out closing the market. "I expect the market to regain its stability. I don't have any concerns for the future," he said.

Yet practically in the next breath, Mr. Yosano contradicted his expression of faith in the market's wisdom by suggesting that the government might step in to support share prices. Tokyo undertook such "price-keeping operations" in the 1990s, as well as after the Lehman collapse, and they are periodically proposed as a way to curtail market falls and boost confidence in the economy.

With a national debt of about 200% of GDP and an impending bill for post-earthquake reconstruction in the hundreds of billions of dollars, it's hard to see how Japan could afford a giveaway for shareholders now. But the deeper problem is that Mr. Yosano still thinks buying stocks is a responsible use of public funds under any circumstances.

If uncertainty over the extent of radioactive leaks from the Fukushima power plant is quickly resolved, it's likely that shares will rally. But market signals will remain important. For instance, if share prices remain depressed in coming weeks, that would suggest investors judge that the reconstruction policies pursued by the government will not ease the burden on future profitability. And Prime Minister Naoto Kan has given a good indication that this will be the case, saying that he will undertake another kind of price-keeping operation. His proposed "restoration New Deal" of fiscal stimulus spending on infrastructure shows that, like Mr. Yosano, he has learned nothing from the past two decades of failed bailout programs.
