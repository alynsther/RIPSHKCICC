NEW DELHI -- Delays faced by steelmakers such as ArcelorMittal and Posco in setting up their plants in India may have put off other overseas investors in this sector, India's steel minister said.

"Once delays [in such projects] happen, it sets off a chain reaction among other investors,"  Virbhadra Singh said at the Global Steel 2011 conference late Sunday.

South Korea's Posco has been trying to set up a 12-million-metric-ton-a-year steel plant in eastern Orissa state for more than five years, but delays in getting mining leases, environmental clearance and protests by local landowners have held up the project. Similarly, ArcelorMittal hasn't been able to acquire land for the past five years for two 10-million-ton-a-year steel plants in Orissa and Jharkhand states due to procedural wrangles and local protests.

Mr. Singh said that environment and forest-related approvals are a major reason why steel plants are taking such a long time in getting off the ground.

"Forests are important for the nation, but so is economic growth. The Ministry of Environment should take pragmatic, and not dogmatic, views of such matters," he added.

The environment ministry is currently deliberating on whether to give clearance for Posco's proposed steel plant.

India, which has a steel production capacity of 72 million tons a year, plans to increase it to 120 million tons by March 31, 2012, to meet rising demand from auto makers and construction companies.
