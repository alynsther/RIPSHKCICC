NEW YORKâ€”U.S. stocks fell broadly as worries over Greece's finances ramped up ahead of the weekend. 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 100.17 points, or 0.79%, to 12595.75. The Nasdaq Composite shed 34.57 points, or 1.21%, to 2828.47, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 10.88 points, or 0.81%, to 1337.77, with every sector in the red. The financial and materials sectors posted the biggest declines.

The market had been down more sharply earlier in the day, with the DJIA posting a drop of about 153 points at its intraday low, but the declines eased as the euro pared its losses in the afternoon. Crude-oil futures also bounced back from their intraday lows.

In the U.S., consumer-price data met expectations and a reading on consumer sentiment rose above economists' estimates, but investors diverted their attention to the euro zone as they continued to mull the prospects for Greece's economy.

"Today, it is about the fear of something bad coming out of Europe over the weekend," said  Paul Zemsky, head of asset allocation at ING Investment Management. 

Even as data showed stronger-than-expected economic growth in the 17-nation euro bloc, investors continued to worry about one of its smallest members. The European Commission said Greece's economy is expected to contract more than previously expected this year. The European Commission also warned that the embattled country's budget deficit would be sharply higher than government targets.

The jitters come ahead of a big meeting next week of the International Monetary Fund and top European officials in Brussels, with Greece's continuing debt problems expected to be the center of attention. Euro-zone finance ministers also meet on Monday.

The day's declines wiped out weekly gains that the DJIA and S&P 500 had coming into the session. The DJIA fell 0.34% on the week and the S&P 500 slipped 0.18% on the week, marking the measures' second-straight week in the red. 

  Ted Cronin, chief executive and chief investment officer of Manchester Capital Management, said the recent declines ultimately stem from investors' realization that the market's climb over the past year has implied a stronger economic recovery than what has actually been seen. 

"The fundamental cause is the disconnect between the fundamental performance of the market over the last 12 months and the performance of the economy," he said. "That's at the root of the tenderness about any particular event that could drive the market one way or another."
