It's not easy to outshine Kanye West, but if anyone can do it, it's Jay-Z.

The Brooklyn-raised rapper appeared as a special guest Tuesday night during Mr. West's performance at the Museum of Modern Art's annual Party in the Garden, in front of an already-frenzied crowd that erupted when he joined Mr. West onstage.

Even before Jay-Z appeared, however, Mr. West's anticipated performance at the after-party was the buzz of the evening, including during the earlier cocktail hour and dinner, which attracted a tamer group of museum trustees and major art collectors including MoMA President Marie-Josée Kravis, JP Morgan Chase Chairman and Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, real-estate developer and MoMA Chairman Jerry Speyer and Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

"Is he staying for the after-party?" one onlooker wondered aloud of Mr. Bloomberg, as the mayor mingled with artist Jeff Koons and MoMA President Emeritus Donald Marron. (The answer: Yes, Mr. Bloomberg lingered outside after dinner for about 20 minutes of Mr. West's show.)

But the earlier crowd, nibbling on mini lobster rolls and mini prosciutto BLT sandwiches, did find time for other topics. 

Author James Frey said he's continuing to develop his art collection. "I just bought a couple pictures by my boy Richard Phillips," said Mr. Frey, pointing to the artist, standing nearby.

Mr. Frey was less inclined to discuss his impending appearance on the Oprah Winfrey Show next week— "I really can't talk about it," he said. "I signed papers."—but was eager to mention the HBO drama he's writing about the pornography industry. 

"I interviewed the CEOs of the three biggest companies in the world," he said. "If we get to shoot everything we've come up with," he said, "it's going to be amazing."
