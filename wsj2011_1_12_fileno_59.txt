It appears that mall mogul  David Simon has finally thrown in the towel.

 has been pursuing for months the U.K. retail landlord  Capital Shopping Centres Group PLC. But CSC, which has preferred a deal with Peel Group, has been fending him off.

On Tuesday, Simon said it won't make an offer because CSC has refused to open its books for due diligence. Also, CSC said Friday it had a potential net asset value of up to 625 pence ($9.76) a share. Simon, which owns a 5.1% stake in CSC, had proposed an offer price of 425 pence a share.

To Simon, the price tag set by CSC represented "wishful thinking and was designed to frustrate Simon's offer."

Under the Peel deal, which must be approved by shareholders, CSC will buy Manchester's Trafford Centre from Peel. That will make Peel Chairman  John Whittaker CSC's largest shareholder.

 is gearing up its development engine. But it is still a far cry from the boom years.

ProLogis, which launched projects valued at $680 million, is planning to start work worth $800 million to $1 billion in 2011. Last year's deals include new warehouse digs in Secaucus, N.J., for  Bed Bath & Beyond Inc.,

 which is expanding in the New York City region. The firm, based in Union, N.J., which opened three new stores in the region last year, signed a lease to occupy 164,000 square feet in a new 244,000-square-foot facility being developed by ProLogis.

ProLogis also agreed to construct distribution facilities in the fourth quarter in West Midlands, U.K.; Fukuoka, Japan and Osaka, Japan. But this still pales in comparison to the $4.1 billion of new construction ProLogis launched in 2007. "The new developments starts we plan for this year is a more prudent approach in today's market," a spokeswoman said.
