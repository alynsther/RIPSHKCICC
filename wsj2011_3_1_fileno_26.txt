ROME—Italy's economy grew 1.3% last year as it recovered from the recession in 2009 and its budget deficit shrank to 4.6% of gross domestic product, national statistics agency Istat said Tuesday. 

Italy's public debt increased to 119% of GDP at the end of 2010, Istat said, using Bank of Italy data. 

Italy's economic growth last year was driven by a 4.8% expansion of the industrial sector, a 1.0% expansion by the service sector and a 3.4% contraction in the construction industry, according to Istat's new data. 

Household spending in 2010 rose 1.0% while overall spending by the public administration contracted by 0.6% in real terms in 2010 from the previous year, Istat said. 

Gross fixed investments rose 2.5% while exports rose 9.1%, Istat said. There was no net inventory effect on Italy's GDP figure, but net foreign trade—the gap between changes in export and import volumes—subtracted 0.4 percentage point from the final figure, the institute added. 

Past figures were revised to show that Italy's economy shrank 5.2% in 2009, more than the 5.0% reported previously, while the 2009 budget deficit was 5.4% of GDP instead of 5.3%, Istat said. 

The new preliminary figures indicate that Italy ran a primary budget deficit of €1.06 billion ($1.46 billion), or 0.1% of GDP, Istat said. Primary budget balances reflect the difference between government spending and revenue net of interest payments on the national debt.
