Builders remained pessimistic about the outlook for new home construction in the first month of 2011, despite increasing signs of improvement elsewhere in the economy.

The National Association of Home Builders said Tuesday its housing-market index remained flat at 16 in January. Although companies are adding jobs and economic growth appears to be speeding up, improvement in the construction industry has lagged behind.

The seasonally adjusted index, based on a survey of 420 builders, has held at 16 for three consecutive months. Numbers above 50 mean more builders view conditions as good than as poor. The last time the home builders' confidence gauge was above 50 was April 2006.

Home builders are competing with demand for previously owned homes and have been struggling to get credit to start projects.

"Unfortunately, a severe lack of construction financing, and widespread difficulties in obtaining accurate appraisal values, continue to limit builders' ability to prepare for anticipated improvements in buyer demand in 2011,"  Bob Nielsen, the NAHB's 2011 chairman and a home builder from Reno, Nev., said in a statement.

On a positive note, Tuesday's report showed the sub-index for traffic of prospective buyers edged up a point to 12 in January. Current sales conditions and sales expectations were steady at 16 and 25, respectively.
