 PLC received regulatory approval Thursday for its plan to launch an initial public offering on the Hong Kong stock exchange, a person familiar with the situation said Friday. 

The company plans to raise US$500 million to US$600 million from the IPO, people familiar with the situation said in January. 

Once the application is approved, the next steps typically involve informal meetings to gauge potential interest, followed by formal pitches to investors and a listing, all of which is usually completed within a six-week period. 

The company would be first from Kazakhstan to list in Hong Kong, joining several other non-Chinese metal and mining firms that have floated shares in the city to raise their profile and further tap China's burgeoning demand for commodities.
