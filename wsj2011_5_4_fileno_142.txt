For 23 years, La Petite Maison has been a beloved restaurant in Nice, France. Having opened an outpost in Mayfair, London, several years ago, owner Nicole Rubi recently opened her first U.S. location in Midtown with chefs Alain Allegretti and Arno Busquet. 

The menu at lunch, launched in January, will be familiar to devotees, with moderate adjustments for a New York palate. Francophiles would do well with traditional fare: baby artichoke salad, fried zucchini blossom beignets or the Provençale soupe de poisson. 

Ms. Rubi's fans include French President Nicolas Sarkozy; unsurprisingly, lunch isn't for the thrifty. Appetizers are $9 to $29 and entrées are about $25 to $40. Indulge with truffles, which will set you back $45 to $85.

To save a bit, go for the $35 fixed-price menu, which changes weekly. On a recent visit, it included an appetizer of red and yellow beet salad or the zucchini beignets, an entrée of grilled salmon or roasted chicken breast and a dessert of chocolate mousse or flan. 

La Petite Maison isn't so petite, occupying a former Rockefeller townhome behind MoMa. Its elegant basement digs accommodate up to 142 diners, but reservations are recommended.

 La Petite Maison, 13-15 W. 54th St. between Fifth and Sixth avenues, serves lunch 11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m.; 212-616-9931
