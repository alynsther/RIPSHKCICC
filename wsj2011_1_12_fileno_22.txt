NEW DELHI -- India has issued notices to 13-14 companies, asking why their licenses to offer telecommunication services shouldn't be cancelled as they didn't meet the eligibility rules while applying for the licenses in late 2007, the top bureaucrat in the telecom department said.

The companies are given 60 days to respond, Telecom Secretary  R. Chandrashekhar siad late Tuesday. He didn't name the companies, or say when the notices were issued.

The move comes in the wake of the government's efforts to clean up the telecom sector, which has been mired in allegations of corruption and favoritism. A government auditor recently pulled up the department for giving 85 licenses--bundled with bandwidth to offer mobile services--to companies which didn't have the required capital to seek bandwidth.

The government had earlier asked some companies to pay fines for not launching their services as per agreed terms.

Mr. Chandrashekhar said the department has received more than 1 billion rupees ($22.2 million) of the 2.18 billion rupees it sought as fines from companies that didn't meet their roll-out obligations.

He said the  Shivraj Patil committee, set up last month to examine the policies and procedures adopted by the department for allocating bandwidth from 2001 to 2009, may need more time to submit its report.

The committee was initially given time until Wednesday to submit its report.
