Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke will take questions from journalists next month in a public forum, another move in his efforts to defend and explain the central bank's policies.

Mr. Bernanke will speak to reporters at the National Press Club in Washington Feb. 3. The last time he took questions from journalists in public was two years ago, at the height of the financial crisis, when he sought to explain the government's emergency response to the situation.

The latest move comes as the Fed reviews its communications strategy. In mid-October, shortly before the Fed announced its latest bond-buying program, officials at the central bank discussed whether to have Mr. Bernanke give news briefings.

Unlike his counterparts in Europe and Japan, Mr. Bernanke doesn't hold regular news conferences. Instead, the Fed puts out a statement after the regular meetings of its policy-setting body, providing its assessment of the economy and announcing any policy decisions, and then circulates a summary of the discussion three weeks later.

A month ago, Mr. Bernanke appeared on CBS News' "60 Minutes" for a second time, defending the Fed's effort to boost the economy by buying government bonds to keep interest rates low.
