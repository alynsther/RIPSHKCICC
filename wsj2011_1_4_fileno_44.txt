 soared to a six-month high.

Sentiment was buoyant in Europe after a positive start to 2011. The Stoxx Europe 600 index made headway for the second day of the new year, rising 0.9% to 280.38.

"Investors continue to embrace risk as global monetary conditions remain extremely accommodative in the face of stronger growth figures in mature economies and ample liquidity in developing markets," said  Lena Komileva, head of G7 market economics at Tullett Prebon. 

"A foot firmly on the risk pedal appears to be the modus operandi for equity markets at the start of 2011," she said. 

In London, the FTSE 100 returned after the long New Year's holiday break and hit an intraday high of 6049.45, its highest since June 2008, before retreating a bit to close up 1.9% at 6013.87.

BP jumped 5.9% following reports that compensation payouts for the Gulf oil spill may be much lower than expected and on continued speculation the company is a takeover target.

 rose 3.7% and  Royal Dutch Shell gained 2.1%.

 France's CAC-40 rose 0.4% at 3916.03, but Germany's DAX slipped 0.2% to 6975.35 after German unemployment unexpectedly rose by 3,000 on a seasonally adjusted basis in December, its first increase since June 2009.

Overall, the main European bourses pared gains into the close as U.S. stocks dipped. Early afternoon in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.2% at 11,650, the Nasdaq Composite Index was off 0.9% at 2668 and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 0.6% to 1264.

U.S. Treasury prices rose despite better-than-expected U.S. economic data, as investors still cautious about the U.S. economic recovery stocked up on low-risk U.S. government bonds. Near midday, the benchmark 10-year note was up 4/32, or $1.25 for each $1,000 invested, to yield 3.319%. 

  Stephen Pope, managing partner at Spotlight Ideas, said he expects the U.S. economy to "surprise to the upside" in 2011, but noted that economic growth in the developed world will remain moderate compared with emerging markets.

With the likes of China and India set to drive growth, Mr. Pope said the energy, infrastructure and mining sectors were among his top picks for the year. "This will, in my opinion, be another strong year for equities, with 10%-plus gains being made on the major developed markets."

In Asia, stock markets were supported by gains on Monday's U.S. stocks' gains, although the Sydney market was dragged down by the devastating floods in the state of Queensland. Japan's Nikkei Stock Average rose 1.6% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index advanced 1%, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 slippped 0.1%

In europe's financial sector,  Royal Bank of Scotland Group  advanced 4.1% after the firm was upgraded to "outperform" from "neutral" at Exane BNP Paribas, which said worries over the impact of Ireland's debt crisis have been overdone.

Other U.K. banks also got a lift as they caught up with gains made by European rivals Monday.  Barclays

 rose 4.2%, and  Lloyds Banking Group added 3.3%. 

The Greek ASE Composite, however, dropped 1.6% as shares in Piraeus Bank weighed on the market. The lender slumped more than 11% in Athens after it announced plans to raise more than €800 million ($1.07 billion) by selling new shares at a 43% discount to their recent price.

In other markets, Italy's  Fiat  was a strong performer, jumping more than 6% as Morgan Stanley issued an "overweight" rating a day after it began to trade separately from Fiat Industrial. Fiat Industrial, which the broker rated at "equal-weight," declined 2.2%.

Other auto firms were mixed.  BMW  slid 1.2%, giving back some of the previous session's strong gains.

Oil was a theme in December's euro-zone inflation data.

The euro firmed after December euro-zone inflation expectations came in higher than expected, at 2.2% year-on-year. Food and energy were likely to have been the main contributors, as oil prices rose strongly in December on a combination of stronger dollar/oil prices and the impact of the slump of the euro against the dollar over November.

But the dollar gained ground later in the session following better-than-expected U.S. industrial new orders and as U.S. equity markets slipped.

Early afternoon in New York, the euro was trading at $1.3294, down from $1.33511 late Monday, although the tone for the single currency was positive overall during European trading hours. 

The British pound was up, at $1.5588 from $1.5473. U.K. manufacturing activity in December was relatively upbeat, rising by nearly one point in December to 58.3, a stronger outcome than expected. 

Elsewhere, gold retreated below the $1,400 mark as investors elected to lock in recent gains. At the close of European equity markets, most actively traded gold for February delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange fell $38 per ounce, or 2.7%, to $1,384.90. 

Also, light, sweet, crude for February delivery was off Monday's two-year highs, down $2.04 or 2.2% lower at $89.51 on the New York Mercantile Exchange by the close of European equity markets.

After the close, the minutes from the Dec. 14 meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve were to be released, and could set the tone for early European trading on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the market will be gearing up for the nonfarm payrolls data, due for release on Friday. As a result, the U.S. ADP employment survey on Wednesday will be of interest.
