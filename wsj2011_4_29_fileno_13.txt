NEW DELHI â€“ An India court will continue hearing Monday the pleas filed by five senior executives in the telecommunications industry who are involved in the allegedly rigged sale of telecom licenses and bandwidth in 2008. 

The Delhi High Court was Friday hearing the appeals filed by the executives against a special court's order denying them bail and sending them to judicial custody, which means they are being kept in jail pending trial. 

The five executives, who were arrested last week, are Reliance Telecom Ltd. Managing Director  Gautam Doshi and senior vice presidents  Hari Nair and  Surender Pipara, Swan TelecomPvt. Ltd. Director  Vinod Goenka, and Unitech Wireless Ltd. Chairman  Sanjay Chandra. 

India's Central Bureau of Investigation lodged charges of cheating, forgery and abetment to crime against the executives earlier this month. All deny any wrongdoing. 

The investigation agency is probing one of the country's biggest corruption scandals ever and has arrested 11 people so far in connection with allegations that telecom licenses and spectrum in 2008 were sold at prices below market value, robbing the federal exchequer of a huge amount of cash.
