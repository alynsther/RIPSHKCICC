LONDONâ€”Activity in Germany's private sector continued to accelerate in January but growth was driven by the services industry, outweighing a modest slowdown in the country's key manufacturing sector.

The preliminary reading of the purchasing-managers index, though below expectations, was still elevated and implies firm expansion. Markit Economics said the manufacturing PMI fell to a preliminary 60.2 in January from 60.7 in December. This was below expectations of a rise to 60.9, according to a Dow Jones Newswires poll of economists last week. 

The services sector PMI, however, rose to 60.0 from 59.2. That was above forecasts for 59.1. Any reading above 50 indicates activity is growing, while one below 50 shows a contraction. Those readings in aggregate pushed the composite PMI up to 61.0 in January from 60.3 in December. 

"The latest [German] flash PMI data highlight a broadening of the recovery from the manufacturing to the service sector," Markit said.
