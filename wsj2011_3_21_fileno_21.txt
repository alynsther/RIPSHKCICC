MUMBAIâ€”Indian shares wavered between advances and losses before closing slightly lower for a third consecutive session, weighed down by rising crude-oil prices from escalating tensions in the Middle East and North Africa. 

The Bombay Stock Exchange's Sensitive Index fell 39.76 points, or 0.2%, to 17839.05, after ranging from 17792.17 to 18007.73. On the National Stock Exchange, the 50-stock S&P CNX Nifty fell 8.95 points, or 0.2%, to 5364.75. 

Volume on the BSE rose to 30.44 billion rupees ($676 million) from Friday's 28.57 billion rupees. Advancers trailed decliners 1,174 to 1,687, while 113 stocks were unchanged. Among the 30 Sensex constituents, 17 ended lower.

"We saw range-bound trade because there were no major positive or negative triggers. The negatives from Japan have more or less been factored in, but nobody is clear about the impact of the situation in the Middle East," said  Prakash Diwan, head of institutional equities at Networth Stock Broking. 

If the Sensex can break above 18,000, he expects further increases. Still, analysts say high crude-oil prices would spark inflation concerns and limit any upward momentum. 

ICE Brent crude oil for April delivery was at $115.21 a barrel in London, $1.44 above the previous settlement. Prices rose after allied forces launched air strikes on Libya under a United Nations resolution to halt attacks on civilians agitating against the regime of Moammar Gadhafi. 

Technology stocks fell after the rupee strengthened to a near two-week high against the dollar in early trading, sparking concerns that export earnings of software vendors in rupees will be squeezed.  Infosys Technologies, which has the second highest weight in the Sensex, fell 0.7% to 2,922.15 rupees, while Wipro fell 1.3% to 433.60 rupees. 

Reliance Industries fell 0.5% to 988.55 rupees, after having shed 3.7% in the previous session following a media report the petrochemicals company expects a fall in gas output from two key fields in 2012-13. 

In autos, Hero Honda Motors fell 2.7% to 1,433.75 rupees, while Maruti Suzuki shed 2.3% to 1,131.35 rupees over concerns the companies could face component shortages because of delays in supplies from Japan. 

Steel companies led advances in metals on hopes of an increase in demand from Japan to rebuild the country after the earthquake and tsunami. Jindal Steel & Power rose 2% to 662.45 rupees; Tata Steel advanced 0.9% to 601.50 rupees. 

Housing Development Finance rose 0.9% to 626.65 rupees on bargain buying after having shed 7.4% in the previous four sessions. 

Ranbaxy Laboratories, which isn't part of the Sensex, sank 7% to 435.95 rupees following media reports that  Mylan
