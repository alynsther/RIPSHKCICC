When Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh leaves the central bank later this month to return to the private sector, the last member of Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke's inner circle during the financial crisis will have departed, making way for a new "in crowd" at the central bank and a different atmosphere. 



The old inner circle—which included Donald Kohn, the former vice chairman who retired last year, and Timothy Geithner, former head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York who left in 2009 to become Treasury Secretary—can be likened to a band of firefighters who managed more than two years of intense crisis together and formed tight personal bonds in the process. During the worst of the crisis they were in constant contact; at times, conference-call lines with New York remained open all day. 

The new inner circle quietly taking shape in its place is smaller and less intense. At the center are Janet Yellen, the Fed's new vice chairwoman and former president of the San Francisco Fed, and William Dudley, president of the New York Fed. Both are Ph.D. economists most at home debating the nuances of monetary policy. They confer regularly, including on big decisions such as the Fed's $600 billion bond-buying program. At meetings of the central bank's policy making Federal Open Market Committee, Ms. Yellen sits to Mr. Bernanke's left and Mr. Dudley two seats to his right, as is the custom for people in their positions. 

Mr. Bernanke is an introvert like his predecessor, Alan Greenspan. But senior staff and other Fed officials feel comfortable sometimes popping into the office anteroom where his secretary sits to seek a moment of the chairman's time. He sometimes wanders through the Fed's staff cafeteria, tray in hand, looking for a seat and conversation. (Mr. Greenspan generally had lunch sent to his office.)

At FOMC meetings, Mr. Bernanke encourages debate and makes the call when the group can't reach consensus.
