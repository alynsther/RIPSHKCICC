NEW DELHIâ€”India has invited Pakistan's foreign minister to resume talks in New Delhi in the first three months of this year, said S.M. Krishna, Indian minister of external affairs, Friday.

At a news briefing, Mr. Krishna said his counterpart, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, has given an indication that he would visit Delhi. But a spokesman for Pakistan's Foreign Ministry, Abdul Basit, said Pakistan would decide to send Mr. Qureshi only if the agenda for the meeting included a broad range of issues, including the disputed Himalayan territory of Kashmir. 

The two countries held a series of talks last year but with little progress to show on resolving the issues between them. The neighbors have fought three wars against each other since they gained independence from Britain in 1947. 

Talks were broken off after the November 2008 terrorist attack on Mumbai, which was launched from Pakistan. India, since then, has insisted that Pakistan do more to clamp down on terrorist groups operating there but at the same time says that dialogue is the only way to take their relationship forward. It has sought what it views as greater progress on counterterrorism before engaging in a wider range of issues between the two nations. 

Pakistan has wanted terrorism to be one of the issues discussed and Mr. Basit said that if Kashmir and other issues weren't on the agenda, then Pakistan wouldn't see the potential for a "fruitful meeting." The agenda for any meeting is expected to be discussed through diplomatic channels, including a meeting of the two countries' foreign secretaries.

"We stand ready to resolve our outstanding issues through peaceful dialogue," Mr. Krishna said. "We expect Pakistan to fulfill its repeated assurances given to us at the highest level to not allow territory under its control be used for fomenting terrorism against us and to bring the perpetrators of the Mumbai attacks to justice expeditiously."
