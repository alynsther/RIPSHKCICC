MUMBAI -- Indian shares ended higher Wednesday tracking gains in most Asian and European markets, but trading volume remained light ahead of the release of factory output data for March.

The Bombay Stock Exchange's Sensitive Index rose 0.4% to close at 18,584.96 after moving between 18,454.93 and 18,622.44. On the National Stock Exchange, the 50-stock S&P CNX Nifty gained 0.4% to end at 5,565.05.

Trading volume on the BSE rose to 27.81 billion rupees from Tuesday's 25.11 billion rupees. Gainers outnumbered decliners 1,611 to 1,193, while 131 stocks were unchanged.

In Asia, Japan's Nikkei rose 0.5% and Korea's Kospi gained 1.3%. Among European markets, France's CAC was up 0.6%, while Germany's DAX was trading 0.8% higher.

"The [Indian] market is trading in a pretty tight range because the recent volatility has prompted traders to shift their focus from the cash market to options," said  Deven Choksey, managing director at K.R. Choksey Shares & Securities.

Analysts said investors will watch Thursday's factory output data for any signs of a slowdown in industrial growth due to rising interest rates.

Factory output in March likely rose 3.8% from a year earlier, compared with a 3.6% increase in February, according to the median estimate in a Dow Jones Newswires poll of 16 economists.

Industrial output grew at double-digit rates between January and July last year, but then fell sharply to low single-digit rates for most part of the rest of the year as the central bank's monetary tightening forced manufacturers to delay their expansion plans.

Of the 30 Sensex constituents, 23 ended higher Wednesday.
