Students of NFL lore have spent this week drooling over Sunday's NFC Championship Game. The Packers and the Bears, one of football's oldest rivalries, battling in the playoffs for the first time since 1941. On paper, it has all the makings of an instant classic. But if history tells us anything, we probably shouldn't get too excited just yet.

Longtime division rivals—teams that have played continuously in the same division throughout the Super Bowl era—have met in the conference championship just 11 times and it hasn't happened since 1993. However, the average margin of victory in those games is about 15 points, and five of them ended with a deficit of at least 17. 

Only two games were decided by a touchdown or less: The Broncos beat the Raiders, 20-17, in 1978, and the Raiders edged the Chargers, 34-27, in 1981. Conversely, the 49ers delivered the biggest blowout, demolishing the Rams, 30-3, in 1990.

This year's incarnations of the Packers and Bears look evenly matched. Chicago beat visiting Green Bay by three in Week 3, then lost by seven at Lambeau in Week 17. That said, the regular-season series has not necessarily been a reliable indicator when historic adversaries meet again for the conference championship. In the seven games played by teams that split in the regular season, the average margin of victory actually climbed slightly, from 14.9 points to 15.6. The other four were decided by an average of 13.8.
