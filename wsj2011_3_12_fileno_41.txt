As rain lashes Flushing Meadows Corona Park on a recent evening, around 30 men, women and children gather inside a bright skating rink at the park's edge for their bi-weekly speed-skating training session.

Since its founding more than half a century ago, the Flushing Meadows Speed Skating Club has always blended national champions with amateurs. Once there were many such groups; now the Queens club is the last left in New York City.

The older racers glide forward, hunched over, hands tucked behind their backs as they streak through relays. Skaters as young as 4 years old twirl, squat and giggle in the center of the rink. Periodically, members scatter water along the ice to fill in grooves created by the skaters' relentless circles.

Colin Prensky, a 25-year-old cyclist and medical student in New York, started in December when the barrage of winter storms kept him from his bike. Now, two months later, he skates with the elite group and he has already placed in a national competition.

At 8:20 p.m. a horn blares across the rink. The skaters skim across the ice and begin tugging blue and black pads out of the corners which protect members from smashing into walls as they careen along the rink's curves.

Jacki Munzel, 47, a former nationally-ranked figure skater, sits on a bench and strips off her gear: first the training goggles, then yellow ankle warmers, black padded neck protector, thick gloves. Some skaters tip their gloves with ceramic half-circles to help their bodies slide on turns, but Munzel prefers the longer, straighter stretches of long track racing.

"I like the space to fly," says Munzel, who only started speed skating in the past year.

The season will end with a flurry of club races on March 17, and many members will compete in the Middle Atlantic Championships two days later. 

Then the club will hibernate until October.
