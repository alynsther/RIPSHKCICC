Stocks rose as a bigger-than-expected gain in monthly nonfarm payrolls boosted sentiment, but worries over Greece limited the advance. 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 54.57 points, or 0.4%, to 12638.81. Kraft Foods was the measure's best performer, with a 2.1% jump after the packaged-foods company's first-quarter sales and profit topped analysts' estimates.

The Nasdaq Composite rose 12.84 points, or 0.5%, to 2827.56. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 5.10 points, or 0.4%, to 1340.20, with all its sectors in positive territory. 

All three measures fell on the week, snapping a two-week winning streak. The Dow fell 1.3% this week while the S&P 500 shed 1.7% and the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.6%. The week's declines coincided with a plunge in commodities, sparked by worries about overheated markets.

But Friday, the one-year anniversary of the "flash crash," investors got some relief after government data showed nonfarm payrolls rose by 244,000 last month, as the private sector posted the strongest employment gain in five years. The increase topped expectations for a rise of 185,000 jobs. 

"The most recent employment reports had been indicating a challenge to our ability to sustain employment," noted  Stephen Lieber, chief investment officer at Alpine Mutual Funds. "This is a little bit better."

The unemployment rate, which is obtained from a separate household survey, rose to 9% last month from 8.8% in March. It was the first increase in the jobless rate since November, when it hit 9.8%. Economists had forecast that the jobless rate would remain unchanged.

A online report from German magazine Der Spiegel saying Greece has raised the possibility of leaving the currency zone prompted U.S. stocks to pare back from their highs of the day, even as senior Greek officials quickly denied the report.
