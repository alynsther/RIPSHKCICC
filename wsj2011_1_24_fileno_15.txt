LONDONâ€”British fighter jets escorted a passenger plane to a London airport following a bomb threat made by a passenger onboard, underscoring how European nations are currently on high alert over potential terrorist threats. 

British police said that a 37-year-old British national was arrested after making threats on board. The Ministry of Defence said that two Typhoon fighter jets had escorted the plane to Stansted Airport, north east of London, after it was diverted from Heathrow. 

A person familiar with the matter said the passenger had said he carried a bomb. However, this person said the passenger appeared intoxicated. 

The plane was an Etihad Airways jet on its way to Heathrow Airport from Abu Dhabi when it was diverted around 1200 GMT after the pilot reported threats from a passenger, a police spokeswoman said.

In recent weeks, the U.K. raised the security threat level for the country's transport hubs to "severe" from "substantial," according to a person familiar with the matter, the latest reflection of mounting concern over a possible terrorist attack in Europe.

The move brings the threat level for the transport sector in line with the national level, which has been at severe since January 2010. Severe means that an attack is highly likely but it is one below the highest level, "critical," which means there is intelligence of an imminent threat. 

Several of the U.K.'s security chiefs recently have warned about the ongoing threat from terrorists. In November, the head of London's Metropolitan Police, Sir Paul Stephenson, said in a speech that the U.K. faces its most dangerous stretch in the fight against terrorism since two failed attacks in the summer of 2007.
