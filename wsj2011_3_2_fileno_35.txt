MADRIDâ€”Spanish jobless claims continued to rise in February, data from the labor ministry showed Wednesday, providing new evidence that Spain's weak economic recovery still isn't creating many new jobs. 

Jobless claims rose by 1.6% to 4.3 million in February from January, the ministry said in a statement. In annual terms, February claims were up by 4.1%. 

"This is negative data," Deputy Labor Minister  Mari Luz Rodriguez said in the statement. "But the February increase was lower than that seen in the two previous years." 

Spain is suffering from the collapse of a decade-long housing boom that pushed the country into recession, sent unemployment spiraling and punched a large hole in public-sector accounts. The economy returned to weak economic growth last year but other sectors haven't yet been able to pick up the slack from the ailing construction industry. The government pushed through a sweeping overhaul of rigid labor laws to boost employment but doesn't expect it to have a short-term impact. 

In a note to investors, Citigroup economists  Jurgen Michels and  Giada Giani said the Spanish labor market has yet to bottom out. "Although job cuts are not proceeding at the same fast pace as in 2008 and 2009, we think we are still far from seeing job creation," they said. 

The labor ministry didn't give an unemployment rate. Data Tuesday from the European Union's Eurostat statistics agency showed Spanish unemployment stood at 20% in January, more than twice the 9.9% average rate for 17 countries that use the euro.
