Asian stocks rose, as big mergers bolstered Tokyo shares and a mild pullback in crude oil helped ease investor concerns about the economic impact of high oil prices. 

"Risk aversion is likely to be the dominant theme until there is reasonable certainty that oil prices can retreat to $90 [a barrel] or below," said  Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney. 

Japan's Nikkei Stock Average added 0.2% to 10525.19. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.2% to 4808.25. South Korea's Kospi Composite tacked on 0.8% to 1996.32. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index leapt 1.7% to 23711.70. The Shanghai Composite rose 0.1% to 2999.94.

Oil prices, which hit a 29-month high of $106.95 a barrel on Monday, took a breather in early Asian trading on reports Moammar Gadhafi might be open to a peaceful end to the Libya crisis. 

Meantime, Macquarie Securities said in a research note that emerging markets would return to favor in coming quarters after investors showed a cold shoulder to the region over concerns of tighter monetary policies and other issues. It noted that the valuation gap between the stock markets of developed and developed nations was "narrow" and potentially entering the point where value would attract capital back to the region. 

"Current-portfolio-funds flow from Asian markets (and other emerging markets for that matter) to developed markets should prove temporary and tactical in nature, with the potential to reverse in the second half of 2011," the firm wrote. 

In Tokyo, bargain hunting and mergers-and-acquisition activity propped up the Nikkei, which rose for the third time in the past four days. 

  Hitachi added 1.8% after U.S. rival  Western Digital agreed to acquire its hard-disk-drive business for $4.3 billion. Medical-gear maker Terumo tacked on 3.1% on news Monday that it will buy major U.S. blood-transfusion-technology firm CaridianBCT Holding for $2.63 billion. 

"This is a concrete M&A example of Japanese companies using their improved balance sheets," said Mizuho Securities stock strategist  Tsuyoshi Segawa. "We tend to forget these [positive] behavioral changes among Japanese firms amid the rising oil, decline in U.S. stocks and the stronger yen." 

Underscoring the fragile offshore environment, many exporters struggled to hold ground.  Sony fell 0.6%,  Honda Motor slipped 0.3%, while  Toyota Motor nudged up 0.1%.

Stocks in Sydney overcame early losses to post the third advance in the past four session. "Bottom-pickers came back to the market to buy financials and oil stocks," said  Jian Wei, senior dealer at City Index Australia, though he added, "I don't think investors are convinced enough to get back to the market in full force. The Libyan situation is nowhere near settled, and this means instability and volatility." 

  Westpac Banking and  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group each rose 1.2%.  Commonwealth Bank of Australia rose 0.2% and  National Australia Bank rose 0.6%. Goldman Sachs Group said the banks "look cheap and are on huge dividend yields." 

  Virgin Blue Holdings rose 1.4% and  Qantas Airways added 2.2%. Airline seat capacity between Australia and China could jump by more than half within a year following the signing of a new aviation agreement, giving a major boost to Australia's domestic tourism industry, Australia's Transport Minister  Anthony Albanese said. 

Seoul shares advanced, though the moves were capped as foreigners were net sellers. Construction stocks led the rebound following recent weakness. Samsung Engineering added 2.2%. GS Engineering rose 3.5%. 

Heavyweight-technology plays lost ground, with Samsung Electronics off 0.8% after Monday's 4% decline on earnings concerns. Hynix Semiconductor fell 0.9%. 

Shares in China rose modestly, with property stocks helping the market overcome an early decline.  China Vanke's Shenzhen-listed shares rose 1.7%. Late Monday, the company said 2010 net income rose 37% to 7.28 billion yuan ($1.12 billion). 

Anhui Conch Cement's Shanghai shares fell 1.9% while its Hong Kong ones added 0.9%.

In Hong Kong, advancers were led by  HSBC Holdings, which rose 2.3%, reversing a multiweek slide and contributing the biggest point boost to the Hang Seng index. Hong Kong-listed energy shares extended their recent run, with Sinopec rising 3.6% and  Petrochina Co. adding 1.8%. 

In other markets, New Zealand's NZX 50 was off 0.3% to 3421.17, Singapore's Straits Times index added 1.2% 3103.84, Malaysia's KLCI edged up 0.1% to 1517.66, Taiwan's Taiex added 0.4% to 8747.75, India's Sensex climbed 1.2% to 18439.65, Indonesian shares rose 0.5% to 3580.31, Philippine shares added 0.3% and Thailand's SET index tacked on 1.6% to 1018.57.
