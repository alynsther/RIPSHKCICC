 PLC continues to edge closer to winning sufficient support to secure the takeover of  Riversdale Mining Ltd and with it a large developing coking coal asset in southern Africa, having now secured acceptances over 33.04% of the company's voting rights. 

Rio, which last week raised its offer for Australia's Riversdale to almost A$4 billion, on Wednesday said the acceptance level had risen to 30.59% from 26.13%.

Rio Tinto sweetened the bid March 10 to A$16.50 a share from the A$16 offered in December, and said it won't increase it further.
