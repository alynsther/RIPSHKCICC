"Chicken Little was not the brightest chicken in the coop. He was very excitable and prone to foolishness." So begins Pacers forward Tyler Hansbrough (pictured) in his recording of the kids' book "Chicken Little," which can be heard this week by calling a dedicated phone number. (It's part of a team partnership with a local library.) Future readings include center Roy Hibbert's "I Know an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly" and guard Mike Dunleavy's "T is for Terrible."

Two Cardinals are off to historic hitting starts, and neither is named Albert Pujols. Matt Holliday and Lance Berkman (pictured) were hitting .409 and .402, respectively, through Tuesday. Since 1933, only one other pair of teammates has had .400 averages at least 30 games in—Atlanta's Jeff Blauser (.406) and Michael Tucker (.400) in 1997.
