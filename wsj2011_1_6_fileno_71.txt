PARIS—French car maker Renault SA said Wednesday it has suspended three employees, including one management committee executive, on suspicion of breaches of company ethics. 

A spokeswoman for Renault said the company's compliance committee had been alerted to possible unethical practices involving the three employees at the end of August, and the three individuals were suspended on Monday. 

She said a suspension is a preliminary step that could lead to eventual disciplinary action, including dismissal. The employees' contracts are suspended without pay and they are barred from entering their workplace. The spokeswoman said Renault hasn't filed a suit against the individuals. She declined to give any further information. 

Renault's management committee, headed by Chief Executive  Carlos Ghosn, consists of 27 executives drawn from the company's senior management. It meets once a month to discuss strategy. 

Renault and its alliance partner  Nissan Motor Co. are determined to become the market leaders when demand for electric vehicles takes off in coming years. Mr. Ghosn, who heads both Renault and Nissan, believes that electric vehicles will represent 10% of global automobile sales in 10 years time. 

The two auto makers are jointly investing €4 billion ($5.27 billion) to develop a catalog of electric vehicles. 

Nissan's Leaf car went on sale in the U.S. at the end of last year. Renault will start marketing electric vehicles with the Fluence compact sedan and an electric version of its Kangoo small van later this year.
