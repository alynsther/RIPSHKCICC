Erik Karlsson scored for the Senators in the fifth round of a shootout, lifting Ottawa over the Rangers on Thursday night. 

Karlsson—a second-year defenseman who is tied for the team lead in points with 44—scored the only goal in the shootout after nine other players took shots but came up empty-handed. 

Brandon Prust scored the Blueshirts' only goal in the third period, with assists coming from Marc Staal and Dan Girardi. Henrik Lundqvist stopped 29 of the 30 shots he faced in regulation and a scoreless overtime period.

The loss snapped a five-game winning streak for the Rangers, who face the Boston Bruins at the Garden on Saturday.
