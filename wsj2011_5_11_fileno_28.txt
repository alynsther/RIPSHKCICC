LONDON—The U.K.'s trade deficit grew more than expected in March despite record oil exports, owing to a drop in foreign sales of intermediate and capital goods, official data showed Wednesday. 

The U.K.'s goods trade deficit with the rest of the world widened to £7.7 billion ($12.60 billion) from £7.0 billion in February, the Office for National Statistics said. 

Economists on average expected the goods trade deficit to widen to £7.5 billion. February's deficit was revised from £6.8 billion published last month. 

Exports of goods fell 0.5% from a month earlier to £24.9 billion in March, while imports of goods increased 1.7% to £32.6 billion. The data showed that although oil exports rose to £3.6 billion—the highest monthly total since comparable records began at the start of 1980—exports of intermediate and capital goods dropped from February. 

Among the exports of intermediate goods that declined were mechanical-engineering products and farming equipment; capital goods included metalworking and industrial machinery, the ONS said. 

Compared to the quarter earlier, exports rose 6.5% to a record £75.0 billion and imports were steady at £97.2 billion, the ONS said. That is likely to be well received by Prime Minister  David Cameron's coalition government, which has placed exports and investment at the center of its economic recovery plan. 

The goods trade deficit with countries outside of the European Union widened sharply to £4.5 billion in March from £2.8 billion a month earlier—surpassing economists' expectations of a £3.4 billion deficit. However, on a quarterly basis, exports to these countries also rose to a record £35.9 billion. 

Overall, including services, the U.K.'s total trade deficit grew to £3.0 billion from £2.7 billion in February, the ONS said.
