A national Republican group is spending heavily on judicial elections in some
states, prompting judges to get more involved in their campaigns as they seek
to hold on to their seats.

The Republican State Leadership Committee plans to spend about $5 million on
judicial races this year, equal to about a fifth of the total outside spending
on such contests in the 2011-12 election cycle, the latest for which complete

This time around, J.C. Penney Co. is playing it safe, picking a new chief
whose strength is in the nuts and bolts of retailing rather than flashy
merchandising.

The struggling retailer on Monday named Home Depot Inc. and Target Corp.
veteran Marvin Ellison as its next CEO, opting for an executive who is known
for his strong operational skills and giving him a long transitional period to
come up to speed.

**ART LOVERS VISITING** Paris’s FIAC and Frieze in London this month will notice that galleries from some unfamiliar cities (at least in art-market terms) have begun to occupy not just the subsidized booths for fledgling dealers but also the pricier spaces near established heavyweights, such as  David Zwirner and Hauser & Wirth. 

Some of these cities may be ancient cultural capitals, but their appearance on
the global art stage is something new. And their galleries are not only
promoting growing local art scenes but also beginning to deal top-notch works
by major Western artists, like Seoul’s Kukje Gallery, which is bringing a 1966
Alexander Calder mobile, “Over the Long Black Tail,” to FIAC.

Here, we look at four art cities that are increasingly making their presence
known in the global arena.

_ **BOGOTÁ, COLOMBIA** _

A decade ago, the Colombian capital was known primarily for two things: the
violence unleashed by cocaine kingpin  Pablo Escobar in the 1990s and the
painter  Fernando Botero, the popular portraitist of uniformly obese middle-
aged revelers.

But Bogotá’s art scene has taken off in the past few years as a network of art
dealers and art spaces has been cultivating rising stars whose pieces
represent a forward-thinking mind-set, while also promoting the works of older
artists who tend toward confronting the country’s history of violence.

“The younger generations don’t as overtly address the issues of violence for
which Colombia is known,” says  Paula Bossa, international director of Galería
Casas Riegner. Her gallery represents the godfather of Colombian art,  Miguel
Ángel Rojas, but she has also promoted artists in their 30s such as Bogotá-
born Icaro Zorbar, whose mixed-media works deal with apolitical topics like
obsolete technology.

Colombia’s main annual art event, the Artbo fair (_
[artboonline.com](http://english.artboonline.com/) _), is now in its eighth
season. Running Oct. 24-27, it features 66 exhibitors culled from 150
applicants, including several from Europe and the U.S. One of the
participants, Galería El Museo, represents Mr. Botero but also fresh faces
including photographers  Adriana Duque, with her haunting photographs of
children, and Ana Adarve.

_ **BUDAPEST, HUNGARY** _

When painter  Alexander Tinei moved to Budapest in 2000, the city had only
slightly more cultural opportunities than his home country of Moldova. In
other words, “next to none,” he says. Now at 46, Mr. Tinei’s career is
starting to take off. At a recent London show of rising Eastern Europeans
curated by  [Sotheby’s](http://quotes.wsj.com/BID),[ BID 0.65 %
](http://quotes.wsj.com/BID) two of his works sold for €4,000. A modest price,
perhaps, for a middle-aged artist at a major auction house, but it shows that
Budapest is becoming more visible.

“It is slow but sure,” says  Annamária Molnár, owner of Molnár Ani Galéria and
former president of the Association of Hungarian Contemporary Art Galleries, a
grass-roots organization created to support the country’s galleries. “Artists
living and staying in Budapest’s cultural scene are gaining international
attention.”

Most midsize cities have public galleries and museums that promote local
artists, but the curators of those institutions in Hungary are influenced by
the government’s desire to steer clear of politicized art. It’s in private
galleries, instead, where you’ll find more experimental artists like  Lajos
Csontó, a native of Budapest whose work, which combines photography and
digital media with traditional printmaking, is on show at the MOM Park
shopping center until April 1.

And for more exposure, galleries look to festivals such as the Budapest
Contemporary Art Festival (_Oct. 3-19;
[cafebudapestfest.hu](http://cafebudapestfest.hu/) _), Art Market Budapest
(_Oct. 9-12; [artmarketbudapest.hu](http://www.artmarketbudapest.hu/) _) and
Gallery Weekend Budapest, held annually in mid-September (_
[galleryweekendbudapest.com](http://www.galleryweekendbudapest.com/) _).

_ **JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA** _

When Johannesburg held its second Biennale in 1997, it kindled hopes that the
city would become Africa’s cultural hub. “Postapartheid South Africa was
exiting a cultural isolation,” recalls  Zoe Whitley, curator of international
art at Tate Modern in London. A third biennale never materialized, but in the
past decade Johannesburgers have banded together to develop events like the
Turbine Art Fair and Joburg Art Fair to promote an ever-more-vibrant local art
scene—and they’re gaining momentum. Among the 10,000 visitors to this year’s
Joburg Art Fair were curators from the Tate and Paris’s Centre Pompidou. Ms.
Whitley says both have actively scouted Johannesburg-based artists such as
Zanele Muholi and  Nicholas Hlobo.

Part of the Johannesburg’s success lies in acknowledging its reputation for
danger, often with wry humor. In Maboneng, an eastern precinct once littered
with deserted factory buildings, property developer  Jonathan Liebmann has
created a lively cultural center that includes GoetheonMain, an upscale
gallery space funded by the Goethe Institut, as well as a project area
cheekily titled “Iwasshot in Joburg :),” displaying photographs taken with
disposable cameras by local street children.

To help retain the city’s artistic talent, galleries have been hosting shows
of major African artists abroad and promoting themselves as places where
Western artists can safely show their work in Africa. The Goodman Gallery is a
good example; Opened in 1966, it is currently coordinating with the
(unrelated)  Marian Goodman Gallery in Paris on a show of South African artist
David Goldblatt (_until Oct. 18;
[mariangoodman.com](http://www.mariangoodman.com/) _), and recently held the
first African show of American artist  Liza Lou.

_ **SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA** _

For half a century after the Korean War, art enthusiasts in Seoul concentrated
on learning about “textbook” Western artists such as  Monet. But with the dawn
of the 21st century, spaces and communes such as Alternative Gallery Loop, Art
Space Jungmiso and Doosan Gallery cropped up to support a new generation of
artists.

As younger artists such as Jeamin Cha, currently on display at Doosan Gallery
(_until Nov. 8;
[doosangallery.com](http://www.doosangallery.com/seoul/upcoming_eng.asp) _),
grow in prominence, interest has also revived in older abstract artists, such
as  Ha Chong Hyun and Park Seo-bo, who came of age during the war, creating
works independent of Western influence. Still active, these men laid the
groundwork for Seoul’s recent emergence into the edgy art world, now with
corporate backers. Last year, octogenarian abstract artist Seung-taek Lee
received the government’s Eungwan Order of Cultural Merit, as well as being
honored by car maker Hyundai with an award and a gallery show. Hyundai has
also begun promoting Seoul’s artists abroad, most recently by helping Tate
Modern acquire nine works by the late  Nam June Paik.

Seoul’s contemporary museums are developing pristine new facilities to bring
these generations together: The National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art
opened its new facility in central Seoul last November, and has exhibited
native artists such as  Jung Ki Beak and  Jae Young Park, both born in the
1980s and featured in the museum’s current site-specific multimedia show
(_until Jan. 18; [moca.go.kr](http://moca.go.kr/) _). Even collectors are
becoming bolder. Multimillionaire  Kim Chang-il opened his Arario Museum in
Space in September, featuring 200 works in the building he purchased for $15
million.

DHAKA, Bangladesh—The government removed a senior minister from his post over
the weekend after he made controversial comments about the value of one of the
pillars of Islam, the Hajj pilgrimage.

Abdul Latif Siddique lost his job as minister for post and telecommunications,
after telling a gathering of Bangladeshis in New York in September that the
Hajj was a “massive waste of manpower.” Mr. Siddique was in the U.S. as part

ST. LOUIS—There was one nightmare scenario the St. Louis Cardinals feared
above all others, and it came Sunday night during the sixth inning.  Yadier
Molina, their star catcher and most vital player, winced as he grounded into a
double play. He didn't leave the batter’s box. Instead, he walked off the
field gingerly, perhaps for the final time this season.

“You lose him,” teammate  Matt Carpenter said just two days earlier, “the
whole dynamic of this team changes.”

Maybe it did. Maybe it will. But for one night, the Cardinals found a way to
win anyway.

Kolten Wong’s walk-off home run lifted them to a thrilling, 5-4 victory over
the San Francisco Giants in Game 2 of the NLCS at Busch Stadium. And it
salvaged what remained of their diminished pennant hopes. The series goes to
San Francisco tied at one game apiece, with the Cardinals bruised, but very
much alive.

Not that they didn’t immediately feel Molina’s absence. The inning after he
left, a passed ball by his replacement,  Tony Cruz, led to a run for San
Francisco. In the top of the ninth, with the Cardinals ahead by a run and the
Giants down to their last out, it was Cruz’s inability to block a wild pitch
from  Trevor Rosenthal that allowed the tying run to score.

But the Cardinals responded the way they have so often in this postseason:
improbably, with power. Wong’s blast into the right-field stands off  Sergio
Romo marked the fourth home run of the night and 11th of the postseason for
St. Louis. The Cardinals finished last in the National League in home runs
during the regular season, with 105.

inning against the San Francisco Giants Sunday. Getty Images

Molina’s status for the rest of the series remains unclear. “It didn’t look
real good,” Cardinals manager  Mike Matheny said. “We’ll have to see what the
doctors are telling us.”

The Cardinals don’t need to search their memory to recall what it is like for
them to play without Molina. He missed seven weeks over the summer with a
thumb injury. St. Louis went 21-19 while he was gone. It wasn't the high point
of their 90-win season, but neither was it a catastrophe.

There are other concerns for St. Louis, notably the struggles of ace  Adam
Wainwright. But the Cardinals need only three wins in their next five games to
secure their second consecutive pennant. And suddenly, they appear capable of
slugging their way out of trouble.

Carpenter, who hit only eight home runs during the regular season, hit his
fourth of the postseason in the third inning off San Francisco starter  Jake
Peavy. And before Wong hit the game winner,  Oscar Taveras and  Matt Adams hit
solo shots in the seventh and eighth innings, respectively.

“I think it’s the postseason,” Wong said. “You have so much adrenaline, so
much excitement going on at this stage, things are going to happen. That’s the
beauty of baseball. Things you never expect to happen, happen.”

The Giants [continued their knack for taking
advantage](http://online.wsj.com/articles/bumgarner-leads-giants-to-game-1
-win-over-cardinals-1413085492) of the Cardinals’ defensive issues. One night
after scoring one run on an error and another with the help of a botched
double play, the Giants stunned the crowd with their rally in the top of the
ninth. When Rosenthal’s pitch to  Joe Panik bounced in front of home plate and
ricocheted all the way to the backstop,  Matt Duffy, who was running from
second on the pitch, came around to score.

But when left to their own devices, the Giants’ hitters couldn’t do much
damage. They finished with only two extra-base hits and, unlike the Cardinals’
deep drives, neither of them came close to clearing the outfield wall.

“We had a couple of good comebacks,” Giants manager  Bruce Bochy said. “The
long ball got us.”

St Louis Post-Dispatch reported the pitch that got past Cruz a wild pitch, not
a passed ball.

DALLAS—A nurse who cared for the Ebola patient who died here last week tested
positive for the disease, heightening concerns about the nation’s preparedness
and protocols for containing its spread.

The nurse at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas was isolated Friday
night after reporting a low-grade fever, the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention said. Tests Saturday night and Sunday confirmed she had Ebola.

European stocks steadied after their recent slide on Monday, with better-than-
expected Chinese trade data lifting mining shares, and some investors also

XIAOZUO, China—Not much happens in this dusty Chinese village, population

Then, on July 30, residents discovered that the bus stand for Route 84 on the

Two weeks into baseball’s postseason, the only thing we can be sure of is none
of it makes any sense. The supposed favorites are out. The star-studded
Southern California teams went home with a whimper. This is now a world in
which money means nothing and opposing teams are just playthings for the
Kansas City Royals to torment.

In fact, if Martians were to set down on Earth this month and take a sudden

PRETORIA, South Africa—A psychologist who has worked with Oscar Pistorius
since he shot and killed his girlfriend last year said the track star is “a
broken man” consumed by remorse, as his lawyers sought to drum up sympathy at
the outset of sentencing proceedings on Monday. (Update: Oscar Pistorius
sentenced to five years in prison for Killing Reeva Steenkamp ).

Mr. Pistorius sat stoically and alone on a wood bench as psychologist Löre

An international team of aviation safety experts has called for sweeping
changes in packaging and other safeguards to limit the fire hazard posed by
bulk shipments of lithium batteries on commercial planes.

The safety recommendations were spurred partly by new research in the U.S.
showing that various types of lithium batteries, once they catch fire in the
bellies of jetliners, can be more hazardous than previously thought as the...

Shelley and Donald Rubin had plenty of reason to celebrate. The Empire State
Building glowed red in recognition of the Rubin Museum’s 10th anniversary, and
its glittering gala raised $1.2 million at Cipriani 42nd Street on Thursday
night.

As Ms. Rubin told us, the museum’s journey dates back 39 years to when the
couple impulsively bought their first piece of Himalayan art while strolling
down Madison Avenue.

“We happened to see a painting in a gallery window, and went inside,” Ms.
Rubin said. “Neither one of us had money at the time, but we went in and we
ended up buying this painting, which was a White Tara. She lived on our
bedroom wall, and she materialized tonight.”

Oddly enough, a private overnight experience called a Dream Over at the museum
didn't sell at the gala’s auction. Ms. Rubin said she slept in the Shrine Room
at the museum’s first Dream Over years ago and that Mr. Rubin stayed home that
night.

“In my memory, in my fantasy, in my biography that I’m writing, I was there,”
Mr. Rubin joked.

The Dream Over event is one of many designed to engage visitors and happens
regularly about once a year, said Patrick Sears, the museum’s executive
director.

“We know the art is foreign to most people,” Mr. Sears said. “But the ideas,
the values, the philosophies, those resonate. The art is a vehicle, but it
isn’t an end.” (The White Tara is a Buddhist deity.)

He said the next decade of exhibitions will be dedicated to each of human
senses, and the entire experience will span several years.

“The senses—sight, smell, touch, taste, sound—are so ubiquitous in the art and
they have very complex, interesting and relevant meaning in the cultural
tradition,” Mr. Sears said. “Tibetans believe in six senses, and the sixth
sense is the mind, and the greatest of all the senses.”

Further uptown, Karen and Dennis Mehiel have shifted focused a bit more to art
lately, and last week, transformed their Upper East Side abode into an auction
house. Eager art supporters bought all 40 of the available works, bringing in
$250,000 for Artadia, the Fund for Art and Dialogue.

“I’m involved a lot in politics, and being involved in the arts is recent,”
Ms. Mehiel, who’s hosted fundraisers for President  [Barack
Obama](http://topics.wsj.com/person/O/Barack-Obama/4328) in the past, said.
“I’ve dabbled a little bit here and there and I’ve always loved the arts, but
recently it’s become something I think is more important to do.”

Artadia supports artists with unrestricted cash awards ranging from $5,000 to
$20,000 in several major cities, and will open to New York City-based artists
this coming January. The Mehiels collect art and serve on Artadia’s board,
though most of their personal collection was hiding behind makeshift walls on
Tuesday, with the auction items on display instead.

Highlights from the live auction included Dan Colen’s studded canvas piece
entitled “260 Days” (which sold for $51,000) and Theaster Gates’s “Coup Coop”
made from wood, asphalt, tar, metal and fire hose (and sold for $25,000).

In case auction-goers—including arts patrons Marilyn and Larry Fields,
Artspace curator Nessia Pope, Whitney Museum’s associate curator  Christopher
Lew and artists Jonah Freeman and Justin Lowe—couldn’t get their hands on
Artadia-endorsed artwork, the nonprofit’s 15th anniversary exhibition at
Longhouse Projects in lower Manhattan will be on display for a few more weeks.

Mr. Fields bid on works to add to his contemporary art collection that
includes previous Artadia award recipients Mr. Gates, Nick Cave and William
O’Brien.

Artadia is “a minor league system for artists to get involved into the major
league galleries,” Mr. Fields said. “It’s not so much the money. Artists
become involved with curators from major museums around the country.”

Stocks’ autumn slump deepened, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbling
223 points and investor anxiety mounting after a second consecutive late-day
rout.

The bond market was closed for the Columbus Day holiday and some traders and
analysts said they anticipated a quiet day in which shares would consolidate
the moves made last week, when significant price swings capped the market’s
most volatile stretch since 2011.

Hong Kong is home to hundreds of thousands of women from Indonesia and the
Philippines who work as “helpers” in pursuit of meager wealth. They are an
indispensable part of the city’s vibrant economy and society. But incidents of
abuse often stay hidden from public view. Follow one woman’s tale as she seeks
to put her life back together after a horrific crime.

* * *

The Indonesian maid was asleep one night in a loft bed in the living room of
her employer’s apartment, surrounded by a television and a dining room table.
It had been her bedroom and her home for less than a month.

She said she awoke when she felt someone groping under her clothing. By the
glow of the aquarium, she said she recognized her employer’s brother-in-law
standing next to her bed.

The Indonesian maid. Hong Kong law prohibits identifying rape victims. Billy
H.C. Kwok for The Wall Street Journal

“What is it?” she later recalled saying, pulling up her covers. She was both
startled and groggy. He smiled and walked away without speaking.

Over the next seven weeks, he cornered her repeatedly, sexually assaulting her
in the kitchen and raping her in the bathroom of the 650-square-foot
apartment, which was home to a family of five.

[“I was treated like an animal and I had to serve him as if I was his wife,”
the maid, a diminutive woman with a quiet voice, said in a later interview. “I
really could not accept
it.”](http://projects.wsj.com/maidmill/resources/maids_animal.mp3) [touch for
audio to hear her speak]

Yet she faced no good choices in what to do – a problem when things go wrong
for the more than 325,000 maids from poor countries who work in Hong Kong and
at times face brutal treatment and abuse.

If she wanted to keep her job, she would have to stay in the apartment because
Hong Kong policy requires foreign maids to live with their employers.

If she fled for home, she would be shamed in the eyes of her husband and mired
in the debt she racked up to get to Hong Kong.

If she sought a new employer and decided just to stay quiet about the
assaults, Hong Kong rules say she would normally have to leave her job, go
back home within two weeks and re-apply for a work visa, a move she couldn’t
afford.

And if she turned in her assailant to the police and pursued a case – a
daunting prospect given her limited familiarity with the local language and
with the city – she would not be able to work until the case was resolved
without special government permission because of a Hong Kong policy meant to
discourage false complaints.

That predicament, advocates say, leaves maids vulnerable and near-powerless
when they face mistreatment and can embolden employers to treat them badly.

“The system is so weighted against domestic helpers,” said Melville Boase, a
solicitor in Hong Kong who has represented maids for three decades. “These
ladies are not here for a get-rich scheme. Most of them are here to support
their families,” he said.

In a survey of more than 3,000 live-in maids released last year by the Mission
for Migrant Workers, a Hong Kong-based advocacy group, 58% said they had
experienced verbal abuse; 37% said they worked 16-hour days; 18% said they
experienced physical abuse such as slapping and kicking; and 6% said they had
been subjected to rape, touching or sexual comments in the homes of their
employers. Some reported having to sleep in the bathroom or in the kitchen.

Global Problem

Hong Kong is not the only place that has grappled with concerns over maid
abuse. Here are some cases that made news worldwide.

Source: staff and news reports

Overall, more than 3,000 maids, known locally as helpers, filed official
complaints with the Labour Department in 2013, according to the agency. The
agency doesn’t break down the type of complaints, but officials say most
concern wages and hours.

“Some employers come to see the maids as their property, to do what they want
with,” said Hans J. Ladegaard, a professor at Hong Kong Baptist University who
has interviewed more than 400 maids, most of whom were living in shelters.

abuse.](http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2014/10/15/google-hangout-on-maid-
abuse-were-taking-your-questions/))

In September last year, a couple was sentenced to prison by a Hong Kong court
for burning their Indonesian maid with an iron and whipping her with a bicycle
chain.

Hong Kong’s helpers typically keep a low profile but tensions can flare: After
photos of another maid claiming abuse – with what appeared to be a badly
swollen face and burn scars on her legs – were widely publicized, thousands of
maids took to the streets to protest carrying signs that said, “We are not
slaves,” and “End the Live-In Rule.”

Help Wanted

Hong Kong's increasing number of elderly corresponds with a rising demand for
helpers. Population in millions.

The ranks of maids, mostly from the Philippines and Indonesia, are expected to
swell as Hong Kong ages, increasing the demand for caregivers: those 65 and
older are forecast to increase to 30% of the local population in 2041 from 14%
in 2012.

Already, they are a cornerstone of the local economy: They number more than
325,000 – about 8% of the working population – up from just under 65,000 in
1990.

Hong Kong officials say their policies governing helpers strike an appropriate
balance between the needs of maids, employers, and the city.

For helpers, there is a minimum wage of HK$4,110 (about US$530) a month – much
more than they can likely earn at home – and a mandated day off each week,
basic health care and food. The local average monthly wage is about HK$13,912
(US$1,783).

For employers, there is affordable domestic help, allowing dual-income couples
to work outside of home while affordable help cares for their children or
elders.

For broader society, the restrictions ensure that foreign domestic helpers
don’t take cleaning jobs from local residents who want part-time maid work
that doesn’t involve living with families, or overwhelm the already-stressed
housing market.

Nicholas Chan, an assistant commissioner in the Hong Kong Labour Department,
said that, overall, relations between employers and helpers are “quite good.”
He adds that the government takes allegations of abuse seriously.

The “live-in” requirement is needed, Mr. Chan said, because “local workers
should have the priority for all work opportunities.” He added that “it was
clear that the local supply could not meet the demand” for live-in workers,
“so we started the importation.”

Still, the story of the Indonesian maid who was raped shows how Hong Kong’s
system can instantly tip against helpers when they face abuse – and the
courage and persistence that are required to pursue justice.

A Labour Department spokesman said “it is totally unfair to say that foreign
domestic helpers receive less employment protection than any other Hong Kong
resident.” The spokesman said authorities had taken “prompt and vigorous
action” after learning of abuse cases.

Although the Indonesian woman agreed that The Wall Street Journal could use
her name, a British-era law dating to the late 1970s designed to protect
claimants of sexual assault makes it illegal to publish her identity. Instead,
she will be called Mary, a name by which she was known to a previous employer.

This account is based on interviews with her, as well as with her family
members, lawyers, staff members of the Indonesian training center she attended
and immigration and labor officials, and publicly available court documents.
Her assailant, her employer at the time, and her employment agency declined to
be interviewed.

Mary, a devout Muslim, arrived in Hong Kong in June 2011. Petite and 33 years
old, she came from a village of about 5,000 near the Java Sea, where people
get by planting rice, collecting wood and fixing motorbikes.

Mary was ambitious. She wanted money to build a retaining wall for her home to
keep mud from flooding in during monsoons so fierce that drowned goats once
swept into her yard. She also wanted to send her sons to college.

She had worked as a maid overseas before, for four years in Saudi Arabia. But
Mary was terrified there after she was told a maid falsely accused of stealing
golden bracelets had her hand chopped off.

When Mary returned to Indonesia, her youngest son—only two years old when she
had left – treated her like a stranger.

Soon the savings from her maid work were gone and a recruiter arrived with
stories of big paychecks in Hong Kong, Asia’s financial capital.

Hoping to get a well-paid job on a two-year contract in Hong Kong, Mary
entered a maid training center before she flew out. The Indonesian government,
acknowledging that women want to leave job-starved villages for opportunities
abroad, regulates such training centers.

In return for the training, she agreed to repay the cost, along with other
expenses such as a medical examination in Indonesia – standard practice for
Indonesia’s departing maids. That would mean agreeing to turn over most of her
first seven months of salary to her recruitment agency in Indonesia.

In the training center, Mary was taught basic housekeeping, child care, and
Cantonese – [even to sing Chinese
lullabies.](http://projects.wsj.com/maidmill/resources/maids_lullaby.mp3)
Trainees are also taught to “be polite, speak in a soft tone and be happy –
smile,” said Wintriyanah, an instructor at the school. (She, like many
Indonesians, goes by only one name.)

####

domestic work.

After nearly four months, Mary was hired by a Hong Kong flight attendant she
would call “Madam.” The woman’s household included the flight attendant’s
husband, their toddler, and two of her brothers-in-law.

When Mary landed in Hong Kong, she hid her headscarf in her shoulder bag. Mary
and several maids in interviews say that they learned at their training school
that Hong Kong people have no tolerance for overt signs of religion.

Mary’s training center said maids-in-training are told not to wear headscarves
to show prospective employers that their hair is short and clean.

(Subscriber exclusive: [read more on Indonesia’s maid training centers.](http:
//online.wsj.com/articles/SB10349853011903034570704580179703183197666))

Soon after arriving, she was picked up by a bespectacled Chinese man named Fok
Ka-ching, whom she would call Suk Suk, or “uncle” in Cantonese. He was one of
the brothers-in-law.

He brought her to the jumbled family apartment in a drab tower on the
outskirts of Kowloon. She worried that sleeping in the living room meant she
had no privacy to pray. When she wasn’t working or sleeping, she felt she
should sit on a stool in the kitchen.

That first day, Mary smiled, pretending to understand the rapidly spoken
Cantonese of Madam’s husband. He dug through her bags, embarrassing her when
he touched her sanitary napkins. He took her cellphone. Some employers in Hong
Kong do so to prevent maids from using them during work hours.

Mary’s job largely involved laundry and more laundry. She hung it on a pole
above the living room sofa in the drying breeze of pedestal fans. Bed-making
and mopping filled the rest of her work shift, which stretched from 9 a.m.
until midnight six days a week. (Employers are free to determine the work
hours of their helpers.)

She also cleaned for Madam’s parents-in-law.

She agreed to work her first two Sundays – her only days off – to earn extra
money to send home.

Journal

Mary said it was Suk Suk who she recognized standing next to her bunk that
night when she was startled awake. Panicked and confused by his actions, Mary
searched her bedding. Had he placed a bracelet there to make her look like a
thief? Might she lose her job, or her hand, as she had heard happened in Saudi
Arabia?

The next morning, she decided to say nothing and avoid him in the hope that it
was a one-off. But doing so was hard in such a small space, and soon, he
pursued her.

In one incident, Mary said, he cornered her as she was sponging the kitchen
counter. He dropped his trousers and underpants to the floor before grabbing
Mary’s hand and forcing her to touch him.

Desperate to escape, she asked her employment agent for a new job. The agent
said she would need evidence to prove she was being assaulted to change
employers. And there was only one way to do that, the agent said: Gather
evidence in a plastic vial if he attacked again.

Mary agreed and returned to Madam’s home. Soon Suk Suk assaulted her again,
forcing her to perform oral sex. She was so disgusted that she washed herself
before realizing too late she had washed away evidence.

Two weeks later, Suk Suk raped her in the washroom. Pretending to clean her
hands at the faucet, she cupped one hand, slipped out of the bathroom, and
reached the drawer of her bed, where the vial was hidden. Faint with fear, she
scraped the evidence from her hand into the container.

She heard Suk Suk leave, then she fled to the employment agency with the vial
in her backpack. Her agent took her to a police station and, within hours, she
was on a medical examination table. Her clothes were bagged as evidence while
swabs were taken from her body to detect DNA indicating sexual contact.

Suk Suk insisted to police in two video recorded interviews that he never
attacked her, according to an appeals court document. He said Mary had twice
initiated sexual contact with him. Around the time that Mary had first
reported the assaults to her employment agency, she was told by her agent that
Madam was giving her 30-days’ notice that she was being terminated.

Mary said later she wanted Suk Suk to pay for his crimes. But she also wanted
to find a new job. She expected the case to take just a few weeks to go to
trial. If it happened quickly enough, she might not have to explain to her
husband and three children what happened, and she could still repay the debt
she owed to the Indonesian training center.

Instead, her life was thrown into limbo for almost two years.

When she reported to the immigration authorities that she had been assaulted
and needed another job, she said she was told she couldn’t work until the case
was resolved.

The restriction is designed to prevent maids from filing false claims against
their employers in order to break their two-year contracts and work for
someone else.

C.N. Law, assistant director for visa and policies at the Hong Kong
Immigration Department, said that a maid claiming abuse or exploitation can be
given an exception to work on a case-by-case basis.

The Immigration Department said it has no records of how many of these
exceptions might have been given in recent years.

> “ Whenever there is doubt, the benefit of doubt always goes to the domestic
helper. ”

>

> —C.N. Law, assistant director for visa and policies at the Hong Kong
Immigration Department

Mr. Law said had he received a request by Mary to work – showing evidence of
her rape case – he would have approved it. He was unaware of her
circumstances.

“The standard we apply is just the reasonableness,” he said, adding, “whenever
there is doubt, the benefit of doubt always goes to the domestic helper.”

Mr. Boase, the solicitor who has represented maids, said such exceptions are
“very, very rare.” Mary said she was not told it was a possibility when she
went to the immigration office.

In a telephone call, Mary unburdened herself to her sister. Her sister
implored her to come home.

“Who will work to pay for the children’s education?” Mary asked.

Mary also begged her sister not to tell Mary’s husband. Her sister decided to
tell him anyway. He was angry, Mary and her husband recall. He told her she
had gone to Hong Kong “for employment, not for men!” Mary was so upset she
deleted his contact details from her phone.

With nowhere to work, nowhere to live, and no money, Mary was forced to live
in shelters, which provided food, fees for visa renewals and some pocket
money. Some maids there sleep in bunk beds – often two maids to a bed – while
others sleep lined up like “salted fish,” as one resident said, on mats on the
floor with blankets. Maids share chores to keep the shelters clean.

Take a trip through time to see the history of foreign domestic labor in Hong
Kong.

At one shelter, nearly all of the maids were Catholic Filipinas who spoke
Tagalog or English, not Bahasa Indonesia, leaving Mary feeling lonely and
alienated. She hated not earning money and the long wait for her court case to
begin.

She stopped wearing the hijab that she had started wearing again after she
left the apartment. She skipped her prayer rituals to be less conspicuously
different, she said. But quietly she prayed to Allah: “What have I done for
you to test me so hard?”

As the months passed, Mary grew accustomed to her new life of waiting. She
moved to an Indonesian shelter where she could [pray and sing the Quran with
her countrywomen.](http://projects.wsj.com/maidmill/resources/maids_koran.mp3)
She began escorting other jobless Indonesian maids on Hong Kong’s double-
decker trolleys to the Immigration Department to help them fill out forms.

nline.wsj.com/articles/SB10362228127429084907704580187481763700618))

With the help of volunteer case workers, she filed a complaint with the Labour
Tribunal, asking for HK$8,976, mostly for what she said were unpaid wages from
Madam as well as the cost of travel back to Indonesia. She was awarded
HK$4,800 after an agreement was reached with her former employer, the Labour
Tribunal said.

And she began enjoying the gatherings of off-duty foreign maids that fill the
parks and sidewalks of Hong Kong on Sundays, with small groups gathered on
strips of cardboard playing cards, taking selfies or learning skills like
making handbags.

* * *

The trial started in a Hong Kong courtroom in May 2013. Mary and her husband
were back in touch by then. “Stay strong and tell the truth,” he told her in a
text message. “Don’t tell lies. You can lie here and win, but not in the
afterlife.”

Suk Suk faced six charges, ranging from indecent assault to rape. His fate
rested with a jury of seven. A five-person majority is required to convict.
Suk Suk pleaded not guilty.

As she waited in the witness box for the prosecutor to begin, she glanced at
the jurors. To her, they looked like Suk Suk. Could they be fair, she later
recalled wondering. She was overwhelmed with dread.

Speaking in Bahasa Indonesia, translated into English, and called “Mary” at
the trial, Mary testified that Suk Suk had assaulted her repeatedly.

Defense attorney Warren Tang, who said in an interview that he was acting on
his client’s instructions, sought to portray Mary as a liar and seductress who
tried to use voodoo as part of a revenge plot against a family that fired her
for being rude to a relative and giving a rash to their baby. Mary said later
she tried to be nice all the time and that any voodoo was simply a
misunderstanding of her Muslim prayers.

> “ Come. You are lying! ”

>

> —Mary, to her assailant in court

For more than a day, Mr. Tang kept challenging Mary, accusing her of lying.
Recounting his examination in a later interview, she broke down in tears and
said, [“I don’t want to be treated that
way.”](http://projects.wsj.com/maidmill/resources/maids_cry.mp3)

In the courtroom, she could contain herself no more. She jumped up from the
witness box, glaring and jabbing her index finger at Suk Suk, according to
several people who were there.

“Come. You are lying!” she shouted at him.

Mary later explained: “My heart felt like exploding. I was emotional and had a
lot of anger. I wanted to convey what I have kept (inside) while waiting for
two years.”

Suk Suk chose not to testify, as was his right under Hong Kong’s British-
forged legal system. But the jury viewed video recordings of his interviews
with police.

Mr. Fok said Mary initiated sexual activity twice, and that if he had forced
himself on her, someone in the family would have heard her scream or resist.

The jury found Suk Suk guilty of rape and four other sexual assaults. On
Mary’s claim he groped her, the jury split 4-to-3 against Mr. Fok, and the
prosecution agreed to dismiss the charge.

Justice Peter Line, in scarlet robe and horsehair wig, ordered him to stand.

“The aggravating feature of your conduct was the sexual exploitation of
someone in such a vulnerable position,” the judge told him.

“The damage you did to your victim will doubtless live with her for the rest
of her life,” he added, noting that Mary “has waited a year and nine months
for this trial, not allowed to work and living off charity.”

He sentenced Suk Suk to 7 1/2 years in prison.

(Read Justice Line's full judgment [here](http://legalref.judiciary.gov.hk/lrs
/common/search/search_result_detail_frame.jsp?DIS=89535&QS=%2B&TP=RS))

Suk Suk is now in Hong Kong’s Shek Pik Prison. On May 21, a three-judge panel
unanimously refused to overturn his conviction. He has the option of pursuing
one final appeal.

Mary has since found a job working for an elderly woman in a residence near
the border with mainland China. “I feel happy in my new job because there are
no men,” Mary said.

Mary said she is thankful justice was eventually served. “The judge has done
his job,” she said.

But she wishes Hong Kong would let maids like herself live apart from
employers, which she feels would reduce abuses, and make it easier to work
while they are waiting for disputes to be resolved.

Her dreams of earning money for her children, one of whom is now a teenager,
have largely been deferred because she had no employment for nearly two years.
She hasn’t seen them in three years. With their father working as a woodcarver
in another part of Java, they are raising themselves with the help of
relatives and a local mosque. Mary keeps in touch with the family by text
message.

Mary imagines the day when she can leave the life of a Hong Kong maid to start
a little business back home with her savings. She recently completed an
acupuncture class. Her Indonesian village, she said, could use a good
acupuncturist.

".. [mary] was told she couldn’t work until the case was resolved.  The

why are there involuntary 2-year contracts for manual labor?  and what is
wrong with quitting and finding a better opportunity?  it sounds like this
"rule" favors employers, not employees.

  

[the threat of] quitting is often better than a court case or extra-judicial
violence.

I believe free election is not the only hallmark of a functioning democracy
system. Some of us may find ourselves empathizing with the umbrella movement
unfolding on the streets of HK. But what about some of the ironies so deeply
embedded at a societal level? Are we looking at a double standard of what
freedom means?

What do these maids have beside Hongkong ? Middle East ? I ticked yes for "is
Hongkong fair to foreign maids" because it is the better one of all the no-
good choices. Although the crime is deplorable, Hongkong carried out a fair
trial which put the rapist behind bars. If Mary had worked in Saudi Arabia and
suffered from rape and abuse, forget about trial or justice. She would be
lucky if she could reach the nearest consulate. But most likely she would
either go home penniless with brain damage, fractured bones and lacerated
skins, or in a coffin.

When it comes to your work, is it time to move on?

Millions of Americans in their 50s and 60s are delaying retirement and holding
on to jobs they have done for years. Many, of course, need the money. But many
others say they simply enjoy—even love—what they do. And if that’s the case,
why not stay?

The answer: Because jumping ship—even...

Mississippi State spends millions less on football than the average power-
conference school—and yet the Bulldogs are now the new No. 1 team in college
football.

Mississippi State ascended to the top of the polls Sunday for the first time
in school history, leapfrogging previously top-ranked Florida State and
separating itself from No. 3 Ole Miss on the strength of its 38-23 home win
over then-No. 2 Auburn, which kept the Bulldogs undefeated this season and in
line for a College Football Playoff spot.

Their status atop college football is a remarkable twist for a school whose
lone Southeastern Conference championship came all the way back in 1941. But
it isn’t just the school’s history that distinguishes Mississippi State’s
climb. What makes it so unlikely today is that the Bulldogs are winning on a
budget.

The Starkville, Miss., school spent $15.3 million on football in fiscal 2013,
according to the most recent data available from the U.S. Department of
Education. That makes Mississippi State thriftier than every SEC member and
all but seven of the 65 schools in the five richest conferences (including
independent Notre Dame). Alabama, which hosts Mississippi State on Nov. 15 in
the Bulldogs’ next matchup with a currently ranked team, spent $41.5 million
on football expenses. It allocates almost as much for coaches’ salaries ($11.8
million) as Mississippi State does for its entire football program.

![](http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-
EY897_COUNT1_G_20141012224324.jpg) ENLARGE

Mississippi State winning a national championship would be like the penny-
pinching Oakland A’s winning the World Series—except it would be even more
improbable. The salaries on Oakland’s roster totaled $93.7 million this
season, according to Spotrac.com, or 80% of the average Major League Baseball
payroll. Mississippi State’s football budget is 71% of the average power
conference school’s. That frugality has no equivalent in salary-capped
leagues: None of the teams in the NBA or NFL spends less than 79% of the
league average.

Mississippi is only poor (and will remain poor) because of the idiot ignorant
imbecile racist republican leadership in the state's legislature.  I will

You fail to point out that one of the reasons Mississippi State spends so much
less on football than the other schools is that they make so much less on
football than the other schools.  Alabama spends a bunch more, but makes a
bundle more.  In other words, Alabama's football program is highly profitable.
But, Hail State and Hotty Totty*...it's good for the conference to have a
State or Ole Miss do well now and then.

Mississippi State's "sudden" rise to football excellence is the direct result
of the school hiring Dan Mullen as head coach.

  

Mullen is a wizard at coaching quarterbacks -- he was Tim Tebow's QB coach at
Univ of Florida (and under his tutelage, Tebow set SEC passing and scoring
records).  His MSU QB, Dak Prescott, is the pivotal element in the Bulldogs' 3
wins over Top Ten teams.

  

MSU's biggest challenge will be to keep Mullen; in view of the woes at e.g.
Michigan, and coaches for whom the jury is still out (e.g., at USC, Univ of
Miami, Univ of Florida, etc.), it will surprise no one if the Big Boys soon
come calling for Mullen and waving cubic cash.

Dan Mullin deserves big praise for getting this program to this point, filled
with talent and confidence these men are here to play.

Coach Mullen has to keep the team and the community focused on clean error
free ball.

A team has got to be quite strong to win after some of the stupid plays that
occurred Saturday, and the Bullies are.

The focus must be on chasing cleaner, smarter play. I believe that the 'Dawgs
might just do it under Coach Mullen's guidance.

Got a bit of a breather ( never underestimate any opponent) then perhaps the
most important game in the SEC to cap the season against the Ole Miss in the
Egg Bowl.

They have Kentucky, Arkansas, UT Martin, Bama (at Bama), Vanderbilt to cross
before the Egg Bowl, this is college football. Be sure to watch, I guarantee
great contests to come.

Hail State!

candor and aplaude your decision to "Vote" with your feet and leave a nation
that has provided you with rights and access to education and choices not
common in this world......it is said that "if - when you are young, you are
not liberal or progressive, then you have no heart......and if, when maturity
sets in, you don't move toward a more centrist or less extreme viewpoint, then
you have no brain"

You are young, and pissed.  Feel free to go forth and discover a world where
the racist of your "new" choice may enforce their judgement with a bolo or an
AK.

But whatever you decide, please don't debase yourself like Alec Baldwin.  He
has been promising to go for a decade.  We should have been so lucky

My advice is to try CA of DC first before you go all in and leave a country
where your right to be pissed is protected.............

Regardless of how bad you think it is.......it is much worse out there in the
big bad world

Kevin,

  

Yeah, I remember those days too -- NFL teams had U of M starters at QB Jim
Harbaugh (Colts, Chargers), Elvis Grbac (Chiefs), John Navarre (Cardinals),
and of course Tom Brady (Pats), all at the same time I think.

  

For the longest time, I have to admit Michigan State football was a joke; we
had a whole succession of loser coaches (Stoltz, Rogers, Muddy, Bobby
Williams, JLS, etc.) and losing seasons.

  

Now, just like Mississippi State ... Michigan State's administration and AD
got their act together and hired a terrific coach (Dantonio) who in turn hired
the best DC in the country (Narduzzi), and finally the worm has turned.
Michigan State, ever since Dantonio arrived, has been competing for B1G
titles, and now maybe more this season and next.

  

But I'm not rejoicing in U of M's woes -- the state of Michigan, and the B1G,
are MUCH better off when the Wolverines are winning, competing for titles and
nationally relevant. That's what I hope to see again soon!

Although that same linked-to source shows that while 'Bama may spend the most,
the Univ of Texas - Austin football program ... by a mile ... enjoys the
largest amount of (revenues) less (expenditures) -- technically not Gross
Profit (that would be Total Revenues less Cost of Goods Sold), but whatever
you call it, that UT excess of revenues less expenditures is pretty

"liberalism in Austin ..."???   Laughing.  Out.   Loud!!

  

"Liberalism in Austin" means folks in Austin favor implementing Texas' death
penalty by using a cashmere sweater and gently smothering to death the
miscreant, rather than the preferred way of virtually all other Texans, which
is to coat the condemned's genitals in honey and then liberally sprinkle fire
ants all over his body.

  

Now, of course, if by "liberalism in Austin" you mean that Austinites are
likely not among this one-third of adult Texans ...

Hey, Jodie.  What's the air temperature outside right now?  You can just post
it.  There's no reason to travel down here to let us know.

Lauren Bizzaro has three years of college credits from High Point University
in North Carolina and the University of Rhode Island. But with no degree,
those credits got her little more than a late start in the professional world
and a $40,000 student-loan balance.

Until recently, Ms. Bizzaro earned $11.50 an hour dressing, feeding and
bathing patients as a licensed nursing assistant at a long-term-care and
rehabilitation facility in Vermont. Now a unit coordinator who handles
clerical tasks like arranging doctor appointments and updating patient charts,
she can’t move further up the ranks without additional credentials, according
to her employer.

Once an aspiring nurse, Ms. Bizzaro, age 25, says she has felt “stuck and
defeated” and has shifted her expectations about starting a career and
settling down in her 20s.

Americans have flocked to colleges in unprecedented numbers in the last half-
decade, fueled by a conviction that postsecondary education is the surest
route to steady employment and higher salaries.

Yet those who begin, but don’t complete, a degree are learning the hard way
that the payoff is in finishing—or that they might have been better off not
attending college at all.

The number of students who don’t complete college is growing. Nearly one-third
of students who started college in 2012 didn’t return to a U.S. school the
following year, according to the National Student Clearinghouse Research
Center. And a new report out from a group of higher-education organizations
found that roughly two-thirds of students who return to school after
interrupted courses of study still don’t graduate.

CP990_NONGRA_9U_20141012185706.jpg) ENLARGE

Those students may find themselves doubly damned: cut out of consideration for
professional-track jobs, and starting their careers years behind their peers
who entered the workforce with just high-school diplomas. Many have student
loans to boot.

And both groups struggle to cobble together a living in their 20s. College
dropouts have a lower unemployment rate than those with no college
credits—12.1% versus 15.5%, respectively, for 20- to 29-year-olds—but they
work almost exactly the same number of hours a week and weeks a year,
according to a Drexel University Center for Labor Markets and Policy analysis
of Current Population Survey data.

On wages, too, young workers with some college have little advantage. There
has been little or no difference in wages among 20- to 24-year-olds who
graduated high school and those who completed some college but aren’t enrolled
anymore. In 2011, wages for college dropouts were even lower, according to the
Current Population Survey.

Median annual earnings for young adults with some college were $15,640 in
2012, the most-recent year available, on par with high-school graduates’
earnings. Associate-degree holders earned $18,120, while those with at least a
bachelor’s degree could expect median earnings of $24,990.

“The sheepskin effect is huge,” says  Paul Harrington, director of Drexel’s
Center for Labor Markets and Policy.

A few semesters of college can drag on young workers’ finances for years. In
2009—the most-recent year available—more than half of students at four-year
public or private, nonprofit institutions who didn’t complete college took out
federal loans, with average borrowings of $9,300 to $10,400 depending on the
type of school, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.
Eighty-six percent of for-profit college dropouts had accrued federal debt.

Those loans are weighing more on people who don’t finish school than they used
to. In 2001, such people had federal loan debt totaling 24% of their annual
income, a figure that rose to 35% by 2009.

There is little or no difference in wages among 20- to 24-year-olds who
graduated high school and those who completed some college but are no longer
enrolled. Melissa Korn joins MoneyBeat. Photo: Getty.

Ms. Bizzaro defaulted on her student loans after leaving Rhode Island. About
15% of each paycheck from Genesis HealthCare Rutland Mountain View Center,
about half what she pays in rent each month, goes to repay the debt.

When a degree was still a relative rarity, any college experience helped a
candidate stand out. But postsecondary education is now the norm for enough
people that a short stint in college is no longer a positive differentiator,
says  Anthony Carnevale, a labor economist who runs Georgetown University’s
Center on Education and the Workforce.

More than half of employers now [require a college credential for all
jobs](http://online.wsj.com/articles/for-some-graduates-college-isnt-worth-
the-debt-1409803261?KEYWORDS=college), and nearly one-third now hire college
graduates for jobs that previously went to high-school graduates, according to
a 2013 CareerBuilder survey of 2,600 hiring managers. Labor-market analytics
firm Burning Glass Technologies recently found that 65% of postings for
executive secretaries and assistants call for bachelor’s degrees, but just 19%
of current secretaries have such credentials.

Few hiring managers say that college graduates are more qualified than
nongrads for jobs in retail and warehouses, but as long as the job market is
tight, employers say they can afford to be picky.

Candidates with degrees or certificates have “shown perseverance and
persistence to obtain that credential,” says  Kevin Brinegar, president and
chief executive of the Indiana Chamber of Commerce. Dropping out after a few
courses makes managers wonder “‘Is that what they’re going to do when they
come to work for me? They’ll work for three weeks or three days and say, ‘I’m
out of here?’ ”

“You want people who can go through an experience and drive it to completion,”
says  Eric Eden, vice president of marketing at event-management software
company  [Cvent](http://quotes.wsj.com/CVT) Inc.[ CVT 2.03 %
](http://quotes.wsj.com/CVT) in Tysons Corner, Va. He says a credential
ensures that a candidate is committed and won’t quit part way through the
seven-week new-hire training program.

Though he would consider applicants who have some college experience but no
degree, Mr. Eden says, “They would have substantially less of a chance” than
those with proof of completion. He estimates that more than 90% of employees
at Cvent are college graduates.

The rise of vocational certifications in subjects like computer programming
and manufacturing can lead to well-paying jobs and prove that a bachelor’s
degree isn’t the only path to success, some labor economists say.

Drew Saffles, 21 years old, enrolled at Pellissippi State Community College in
Knoxville in August 2011 with the intention of pursuing a finance degree.
Bored with the course work, he left school the following April.

He worked part time jobs at a Sears store and as a server at a local

Mr. Saffles enrolled in the Tennessee College of Applied Technology in
Knoxville in May of last year and graduated as an HVAC and refrigeration
technician. He landed a job at Rocky Top Air Inc. in Knoxville, where he makes
$14 an hour, plus sales incentives and overtime.

Ms. Bizzaro says she has no immediate plans to return to school, but it may
only be a matter of time.  Jeanne Phillips, senior vice president and chief
human-relations officer at Genesis Healthcare LLC, says Ms. Bizzaro’s current
position could be a step toward a solid career opportunity, “with the right

There are worthy reasons why people don't complete college. Since the expense
of attending now is so great, a lack of funds is certainly one example.
Marriage and a a new born child bring immediate financial pressure that may
only be relieved by leaving college and working full time even if it means
making coffee or flipping hamburgers. Still, however, the stigma of not
completing must be overcome to succeed.

"...while those with at least a bachelor’s degree could expect median earnings
of $24,990."

What kind of degree is worth so little?

Probably needed some courses not involved with "underwater" basket weaving.

Has everyone lost the ability to self judge the candidate in front of them
without some directive that is subjective at best?

For an employer a candidate with a college degree, Associate or Bachelors, is
evidence that the candidate has at least once managed thru to completion a
long term complex, demanding task. This does not prove the candidate will be
able to perform the job they are applying for but is evidence that they have
set difficult objectives for themselves and followed thru at least once.

  

Unfortunately attending college for three years with no degree cannot tell an
employer if the candidate was a serious student or just passing time. We all
remember students that changed majors several times, or was on probation when
they stopped. We also remember serious students who dropped out because or
personal or financial crises. With a stack of resumes to review something else
has to be in the resume that pops out to the reviewer that provides other
evidence of self motivation and persistence.

  

Candidates in this position should use their resume or application and lead
with significant accomplishments or leadership experience.  They should also
be persistent.  Persistence and self-management is a very valuable attribute.
If can't be demonstrated easily with a transcript it must be demonstrated in
person.

@JOHN EIDSNESS In the tech world, dropping out of college means you are
impatient with the college grind and see no reason to take courses you deem
worthless. You can argue all day about that decision, but a lot of very smart
kids look to Gates, Zuckerberg, Jobs, Ellison, and then look at the guy with
the Masters degree making coffee for a living. Clearly, the proof of the value
of a college 'education' is on the stuffy, bureaucratic universities. The
smartest young people have made their decisions, and have the billions that
say they were correct. And, a lot of other young people are figuring out who
is right.

9UA%3D%3D_E1) It's important to note those individuals dropped out because
their businesses were beginning to take off and outpace their schoolwork with
regards to priority.

  

An individual in the tech trade who drops out a year earlier with no "Apple"
and then tries to apply to the same job where another individual has finished
their degree and is competing may find they lose out.

  

The college degree is becoming the norm, just as the high school diploma was
many years ago.

I would ask any employer who is reluctant to consider hiring someone with only
a partial college credit listing on their resume to ask why the education was
interrupted. It may be that a person chose to commit to military service, or
care-giving for a family member or suffered a major illness. Hardly
circumstances that should reflect negatively on an individual.

The article suggests that Ms. Bizzaro living in Vermont. People her age tend
to leave VT, because almost any place else has more jobs and/or affordable
housing, relative to wages. It's a bit hard to explain why she did 3 years of
education out of state and then came back hoping to create a career for
herself. Vermont is a pretty tourist destination, but even in the growth
areas, the job market is tight and depressing.

  

Second, her chosen field of nursing has several credentials, all with known
education paths. I'm not sure what to make of someone who wants a career in
medicine but isn't interested in college.

  

Lastly, she defaulted on the loans. The amount of programs there are out there
to prevent default are mind boggling. A call to VSAC (student loan agency in
VT) and then proper follow through probably would have prevented wage
garnishment.

  

Her story doesn't seem to be about how a little bit of college is bad for you
as it is about lack of follow through is bad for you.

Bottom line in reality is with a few years of liberal arts education at any
college or university, no matter how good, has not prepared anyone for a job.
They still know exactly what they knew when they graduated HS - still have no
skill that can be translated into a job.  Better off to go to a good trade
school, or technical college for a few years - you will be immediately
qualified for some job the moment you finish the course.

Isn't it so...  Before 0bama, students borrowed money from private
institutions, and repaid their loans with money per a repayment schedule.
Under 0bama, there are many avenues of "forgiveness" and "repayment in-kind,
without money."  Before 0bama, it wasn't taxpayer funds put up front?

You believe in "Democracy;" I believe in our "Constitutional Republic."  Your
eagerness to defend 0bama, despite his countless felonies and acts of treason,
makes him Your 0bama.  An egregious traitor is NOT my president.  My point is
Your 0bama seized control of the Student Loan Program for political gain at
greater taxpayer expense.  That he hastens "forgiveness" literally and in-
kind, is the net penalty we taxpayers suffer under Obama.  I didn't see your
response to that.  THIS is the treason and damage to the U.S. the under Obama

Now you know what we do for working class students at the California State
University. Our BA requirements are high, but flexible. A student I counseled
this week took an online course while pregnant that we counted, had early
finals for another since she was due, was invited to "challenge" a non-Western
Culture course which her life experience duplicated (she'd write a term paper
but no classes), or take a 699 independent study to satisfy it, which the prof
doesn't get paid for, but which we all do gladly. We turn unemployed into
employed, renters into home owners, alienated into stakeholders. We make a
revolution one student at a time. Tell this young woman not to lose heart.
Come enroll with us. Our motto is, "We want to work with you." And we know
how.

@GEORGE LEONARD We touring several CSU campuses in the past few years. It
appears that many continue to grow dubious degree programs that suck down tax
dollars rather than focus more on needed skills and quality educations.

  

Only one campus declared a mission up front. The goals are to get your student
out in four years with a job in their degreed field. And, they had the guts to
show how 94% of graduates had jobs in their field within 6 months of
graduation. And, they were focusing on how to better meet the 4 year goal with
the funding they received. No whining, no excuses that we saw in other
campuses.

  

If parents or students cared as much as this campus administration did, we
would not be these kinds of articles. The other schools would be out of
business.

This is another problem with the artificially high cost of college, the risk
of experimenting is too high.  You may or may not be college material, but you
can't try it out or you risk ending up as the unfortunate young woman in the
article.

  

The flip side is our society acts like trade schools are for losers which only
drives more students into a situation that isn't the right fit for them.  I
have a friend who went through undergrad, graduated, and did 1 year of a
Masters program.  He now works happily as a firefighter and shouldn't have
gone to college at all if that's what truly makes him happy.

The federal government is the worst predatory lender on the planet for pushing
students loans with no consideration of what degree is being pursued and how
likely the student is to be successful in school. If private sector banks were
doing this, they would be facing multi-billion dollar fines like they are for
mortgage lending practices, and people would be screaming about jail time for
executives.  Shareholders would be filing lawsuits.  But when Barack Obama
takes over the student loan market, forces taxpayers to finance it, and
doubles down on terrible lending practices to buy votes from young people, he
campaigns on his "compassion."  We are only seeing the beginning of this
disaster.

2 years of Poly Sci isn't equivalent to 2 years of a chemistry degree.

Apples mixed with oranges.

Too many college graduates are discovering that real work is required after
graduation, and that "life is one giant report card".

Personal motivation is the greatest predictor of success.

Robert, I agree 100% and it's sad where the country/world has evolved to or
degenerated to. All I was saying is knowledge is most always valuable. Over
many years I have hired very bright individuals with little or no college and
I passed on idiots with advanced degrees, the problems is more in the hiring
process these days. The eye to eye contact is gone.

I'm a former professor.  I have seen this coming for decades, as have others.

  

There is a straightforward explanation for everything in this article - from
employers needing college degreed people for jobs that only require a high
school education, to low salaries for college graduates, and lower ones for
high school grads.  Here is the explanation.

  

The higher education system has become corrupt when it comes to education.
The only reason it isn't as corrupt when it comes to research is that
consumers of research are much more sophisticated than "consumers" (once
quaintly called "students") of education are.

  

That corruption leads to poorly educated graduates.  Much worse, it leads to
poorly educated high school graduates.  After all, if the teachers aren't well
educated, what else can one expect.

  

I can't give all the facts to support my argument here, but "A Tale Out of
School" and tales from regional schools,  all on my blog, make everything
clear.  (My blog is inside-higher-ed .)

Thank you very much.  I don't, but I have posted some of my teaching materials

Also, if you look at "A Tale Out of School", you will see why I don't.

KJqUg%3D%3D_E1)  Hi, I would like your opinion of the Global Warming Research
as produced by the IPCC.  I have looked at some of the leaked emails and it
certainly indicates collusion in order to keep the research funding coming.
Please note this is a process question,  I do not have an educated opinion on
the technical side of the research.  However when data transforms appear to be
selected to keep the funding coming and the peer review process appears to be
corrupted, it makes me worry.

@Tim Dolan @Mark Feldman

I don't want to comment on anything other than academic integrity, but that I
can do.  First, here is a quote.

  

"...the ethical standards of the sciences ( certainly in mathematics) have
been degraded to such an extent that the most bare-faced plagiarism between
colleagues ( often at the expense of those who can't defend themselves), seems
to have become the norm. At least it is generally tolerated, even in
exceptionally flagrant instances. ."

(From Alexandre Grothendieck's Letter to the Swedish Royal Academy rejecting
the 1988  $250,000 Crafoord Prize)

  

I have seen a very egregious case (and other, less egregious ones)where a very
productive mathematician's career (He was the victim.) was almost destroyed by
the perpetrators and their colleagues.  I will post the story on my blog.  (It
might take a week.)

  

Thanks for the great question about process.

[@Mark Feldman](http://online.wsj.com/user/profile/public/E1_puhLIHSOmLAgYICA1
KJqUg%3D%3D_E1)  Thanks for your response.  What got me interested in this
issue was when I had been to a couple of places that are actually used as
evidence for GW so as an educated amateur I started asking questions.  For my
trouble I was told that GW was "Settled Science" and that I was a "denier".
For me this a great big red flag.

  

I will check your Blog.

  

Thanks again.
