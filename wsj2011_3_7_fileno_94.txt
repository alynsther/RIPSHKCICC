Developers are getting more bullish on Manhattan as least when it comes to the prices they're willing to pay for development sites.

According to an analysis by Eastern Consolidated, deal volume was up in 2010 especially compared with 2009, when sales of development sites virtually ground to a halt. 

Activity still has a long way to go before it hits the levels of 2006 and 2007 and construction financing is still scarce.

But pricing also is on the rise. Last year's numbers were driven especially by the acquisition of the site of the former Drake Hotel on Park Avenue, considered one of the best development sites in the world.

Many of the sites acquired recently were by developers eyeing new rental apartments, one of New York City's fastest recovering sectors in the real-estate market. 

In the latest high-profile deal, news broke last week that two former American Stock Exchange buildings were purchased by developers eying a mixed use complex.

"The 2010 numbers reinforce the idea that Manhattan will always be prized real estate," says Barbara Byrne Denham, Eastern Consolidated's chief economist.
