In a sign of the Bay Area's relative wealth, children in the region are more likely to live in households with higher incomes and with parents who are married and have higher education levels than children statewide, according to a survey of parents from the Lucile Packard Foundation for Children's Health released in December. While 24% of children in the Bay Area live in households with incomes above $125,000, only 18% statewide had this level of income, the survey found. But because of the high cost of living in the Bay Area, 23% of parents here said their level of income isn't enough to provide for their children, only slightly lower than 26% statewide. "While that's better than the rest of California, that's still concerning," said  David Alexander, president and chief executive of the foundation.
