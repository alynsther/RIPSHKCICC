President Barack Obama punted on the National Football League's labor dispute Thursday, saying he has more important things to do than sort out gripes between the rich and the wealthy. "My working assumption, at a time when people are having to cut back ... is that the two parties should be able to work it out," Obama said. It remains to be seen if basketball fan Obama will react differently when the NBA's collective bargaining agreement expires on June 30.

Although less than 1% of the U.K. population lives in Glasgow, Scotland, six of the 20 English Premier League managers, including Manchester United's Alex Ferguson (pictured here) and Liverpool's Kenny Dalglish, were all raised in the industrial city of 600,000 in western Scotland. Since 1986, three Glaswegians—Ferguson, Dalglish and former Arsenal coach George Graham—have won the league title a combined 17 times. Some say the structure of Scottish football makes it an ideal proving ground for coaches, while others suggest a tangible fear of failure in England serves as strong motivation. Manchester United plays at Liverpool on Sunday.
