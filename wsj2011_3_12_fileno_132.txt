For the comprehensive, wired-in March Madness experience, it all starts here: every single game, from the First Four to the Final, streamed live over WiFi or 3G to the your iDevice of choice, with enough scores and stats to turn you into the all-seeing, all-knowing bracketological hive mind of March Madness. 

The only question, really, is how you're going to put in enough time at work this month to pay for this amazing service. Except wait, it's completely free. Rejoice, office drones, hour-long stints "making coffee" in the break room have never been so fun.Free, available on iPhone, iPad 

But what do you do when there aren't any games on and you have a hoops-related hankering? Even with total access to the expanded field of 68, it'll happen eventually, and "iQ College Basketball Trivia" is here to help. 

A straightforward trivia game with plenty of questions to challenge novices (was Dwayne Wade an All-American...in the '60s?) and gratify experts (did Sam Perkins play at UNC or Memphis?) plus bonuses and achievements to spur you through them, iQ gives you the motivation you need to memorize your NCAA arcanum and show your buds who's boss—or at least finally understand all the fuss about John Wooden.$1, available on iPhone 

Okay, so "3 Point Hoops Basketball," a rudimentary arcade throwback, might be the time-waster you save for around Final Four time, but that doesn't mean it isn't an entertaining distraction. 

You perfect the speed and direction of your finger flicking, like you would the mechanics of an actual shot…and that's pretty much the whole game. A sudden death mode and leaderboards to keep things interesting. 

A little mindless? Absolutely. But once you get your Larry Bird stroke down and start knocking down those treys, damned if it isn't strangely satisfying. $1, available on iPhone.
