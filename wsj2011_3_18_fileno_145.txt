Ben Hibon was lavishly praised when his animation sequence appeared in last summer's "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows," with one critic saying it "might just be the single best thing in all seven films."

Warner Bros. might not agree that it overshadowed its entire multibillion-dollar franchise, but the studio is happy enough with Mr. Hibon's work to have released this week the first of four animations to support its coming film "Sucker Punch," due March 25.

The 33-year-old Mr. Hibon, whose background is in graphic design rather than moviemaking, has a distinctive style, part Japanese anime, part Grimm's Fairy Tales. The Swiss-French animator and director has a collection of hundreds of Japanese cartoon-character toy figures.

His current two major projects are a live-action feature—a dark twist on the Peter Pan story—and an animated zombie movie called "A.D." Neither yet has distribution. Mr. Hibon is in the process of securing lead actors for the Pan movie, which he describes as "a complete re-imagining" of the classic children's story with Captain Hook as a retired detective on the trail of missing children. Peter Pan is the suspected abductor.

He says communicating his ideas to actors shouldn't be much different than working with animators. Animators must "reinterpret everything that you have in your head and [for a director] letting go is as brutal as working with an actor," he says.
