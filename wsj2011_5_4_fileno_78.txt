BANGALORE -- Nasdaq-listed outsourcing company EXL Service Holdings Inc. has agreed to acquire Outsource Partners International for $91 million.

Outsource Partners provides complex finance and accounting outsourcing services, said

Rohit Kapoor, president and chief executive of the New York-based EXL.

Outsource Partners employs 3,700 people in locations including the U.S. and India, has 80 clients, and reported revenue of $76 million in 2010.

Outsourcing companies are trying to become one-stop shops as clients do not want different vendors for different services, said Pradeep Udhas, executive director and head, information technology and business-process outsourcing at KPMG India Pvt. Ltd.

"For EXL, the OPI acquisition fills a gap by expanding in an area that they were not present in earlier," he said. 

In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, EXL said it would finance the merger with existing cash on its balance sheet and proceeds of a revolving credit facility. The company still is negotiating the terms of the credit facility.

EXL, which is debt-free, has $114 million in cash, according to information on its Web site.

Outsource Partners, with headquarters in New York and Los Angeles, was founded in 2002 by merging an accounting firm's business-process-oustourcing division with a finance-and-accounting-outsourcing company that had an offshore-service center in Bangalore, according to the compan's Web site. 

Avendus Capital and FT Partners advised Outsource Partners on the transaction. The transaction is expected to close by June.
