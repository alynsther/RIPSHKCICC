Today it seems to take a royal wedding to persuade women to don a fancy hat. But there was a time when ladies all wore them—and competed to be the most extravagant. Brims were broad enough to hold a wedding cake. Elaborate turbans and precarious cylindrical constructions raced toward the sky, seemingly restrained only by vast quantities of flowers and feathers and tat and tulle. The heyday of the milliner's art, like that of the picture postcard, is long past, but Tom Phillips's 'Women and Hats' (Bodleian Library, 112 pages, $25) summons up a fond nostalgia for both. The book's 200 photographs, taken between 1900 and 1950, portray middle-class British women who stepped into High Street studios to purchase penny-a-print photographic postcards of themselves. Most of the women remain unidentified, but the messages they wrote bring a few to fleeting life, including Connie Beldig, who in 1910 wrote from Manchester: "Do you recognise me now, as it is so long since you saw me, but this isn't a very good photo." It is, however, a very impressive hat.
