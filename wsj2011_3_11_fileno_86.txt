 The Complete First Season 

This western, which aired on NBC from 1959 to 1963, told the story of two brothers caring for their recently murdered father's ranch, joined by a drifter played by Robert Fuller. The first season, shot in black and white (the series went color in 1961), featured songwriting great Hoagy Carmichael as a ranch hand.
