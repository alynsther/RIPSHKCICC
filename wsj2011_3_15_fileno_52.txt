The recently opened  Dee Daa in Midtown offers hot and spicy Thai dishes with fast-food efficiency. 

Service is quick at this cafe-like, brightly lit 28-seat restaurant, where you place your order at the counter and wait for your name to be called. Try the coconut-milk soup ($2.50) or skip to the mango salad with cashews and coriander ($2.50), followed by pad Thai or drunken noodles ($7.50). The clientele is mainly office-goers and young people, and the portions are generous. 

Dee Daa, which means joyful or exuberant in Thai, is Mallika Sukjaro's maiden venture into the food business in New York. Her family in Thailand owns and operates hotels there, but she saw an opportunity here as she realized most people associate Thai food with table service, not fast food. "I want to see Thai food becoming comfort food for Americans," she said. Her recommendation is the green curry with shrimp or chicken ($8). "It's not too adventurous but it might be fun." 

Dee Daa also serves a selection of Thai teas ($1.98) and some frozen fruit to end the meal with.

 Dee Daa is at 155 E. 44th St. (between Lexington and Third Avenue) and is open 11:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through Saturday. Dine-in or take-out are available; 646-396-6500.
