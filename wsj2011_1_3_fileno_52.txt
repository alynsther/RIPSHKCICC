At first glance,  Les Ambassades looks like just your warm neighborhood café. Indeed, there's often a long line of patrons waiting to take out tiramisu or friends greeting friends over a chocolate croissant and a café au lait. 

But the food at the "boulangerie/patisserie/café" is international. Wait staff serve comfort food from France, North and West Africa, Vietnam and the Americas around the clock. 

The eatery, whose comfortable orange-colored setting recalls a café in Dakar, quickly became a meeting place for business workers and Senegalese immigrants after it opened eight years ago as Patisserie des Ambassades. It is adding a second location next month, at Lenox between 126th and 127th streets, as Harlem also becomes more global.

The menu, which is vegetarian-friendly, includes Vietnamese spring rolls, croque-madame, shawarma or Robespierre (grilled lamb, veggies and potatoes on a baguette). All of the lamb offerings, which also include a burger, kebabs and shank, are standouts. For a taste of Senegal, try the fatayas, mackarel empanadas flavored with chiles. 

Weekday lunch specials, which include a main course, a side and a drink, are $7, and served from 11:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. All are best accompanied by a juice—ginger, passion fruit, guava or mango.

Don't leave without a pastry.
