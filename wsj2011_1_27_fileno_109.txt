DETROITâ€”Michigan's new head of human services promised to streamline the process for funding indigent burials, following a Wall Street Journal article Monday describing backlogs at the Wayne County morgue in Detroit.

Maura Corrigan, recently appointed director of human services by Gov. Rick Snyder, contacted the county about its funding applications this week and pledged to reduce delays in payments so corpses that have been awaiting burial at the morgue can be laid to rest within 30 days, said Dennis Niemiec, a spokesman for Wayne County. A state official confirmed that the department was working with the county on the issue. Officials from the county medical examiner's office aim to bury about 50 bodies in that time period, Mr. Niemiec said.

Wayne County has about 185 bodies in storage awaiting burial, some dating back to 2008. Because of state budget cuts, the county can afford to bury only about half as many bodies as it needs to, Albert Samuels, chief investigator for the county's medical examiner's office, told the Journal last week.

Wayne County is among many cash-strapped localities around the country scrambling to deal with the cost of indigent burials amid budget cuts at the state and local levels.

In Toledo, Ohio, the city council on Tuesday approved a plan to adopt cremation as the default option for indigent people, unless their religion bars it. The change is aimed at saving the city $600 per body and tens of thousands of dollars a year.

Michigan spent about $4.2 million on indigent burials in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2009, burying about 17,000 bodies.
