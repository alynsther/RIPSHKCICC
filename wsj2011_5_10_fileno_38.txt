HYDERABAD: Drug maker Aurobindo Pharma is evaluating restructuring options including spinning off its active pharmaceutical ingredient and formulations unit in a bid to unlock value of an expanding segment of its business.

The Hyderabad-based company made this announcement, and followed it with its results, which showed a net profit increase of 13% to 5.94 billion rupees ($132.94 million) for the year ended March 31 compared with 5.26 billion rupees ($117.72 million) in the previous year.

"In order to further strengthen and provide focus to the growing volume of (active pharmaceutical ingredients) and formulation business, the board has constituted a restructuring committee to explore and evaluate possible growth-linked restructuring options," said the firm in a statement to the Bombay Stock Exchange.

The company's options include a spin off or demerger or any "other suitable form, with the ultimate objective of enhancing shareholders' value and customer satisfaction."

The restructuring committee made up of the company's directors including independent directors is expected to recommend the best options to the company's board within three months.

Aurobindo Pharma is not the first to do this; other Indian drug makers have also their reorganized businesses. Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, for instance, has demerged its generic business from its specialty business. Sun Pharmaceuticals and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories have hived off their research and development units. Piramal Healthcare sold its domestic formulations business to Abbott Laboratories for $3.72 billion.

The restructuring strategy should help Aurobindo Pharma increase focus on its businesses and help speed up decision making, said an analyst at a domestic brokerage, who didn't want to be named.

A spin-off also will help the company take off its balance sheet the losses being run up by its penicillin business, the analyst said.
