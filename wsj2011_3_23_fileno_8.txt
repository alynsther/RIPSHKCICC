DETROITâ€”The city of Hamtramck reached a deal with neighboring Detroit to settle a dispute over shared tax revenue from an auto plant, easing budget pressure that had threatened to push the small enclave into bankruptcy. 

Under the agreement, which Hamtramck officials signed Wednesday, Detroit will pay Hamtramck $3.2 million in owed tax revenue collected by Detroit from a  General Motors Co.

 factory that straddles the two cities, according to Hamtramck City Manager Bill Cooper. In return, Hamtramck will pay a nearly equivalent sum to Detroit for water and sewage service that was in arrears. 

"The upshot is that we stay afloat for 10 to 12 months," Mr. Cooper wrote in an email. "Hamtramck has signed the agreement, and we expect Detroit to sign the agreement within the next couple of days." 

A spokesman for Detroit said resolution of the dispute "sets the stage for future cooperation" between the cities. 

Detroit used to send Hamtramck about $2 million a year in tax revenue from the GM factory that is now building the Chevrolet Volt electric car. In January of 2010, Detroit stopped giving Hamtramck any of the shared tax revenue, saying it had overpaid $7 million through the years. That led Hamtramck to sue Detroit. In October, Detroit countersued. 

Those lawsuits will be set aside, according to a copy of the agreement. Detroit will resume payments from the 1981 revenue-sharing agreement, Mr. Cooper said. Under the revenue-sharing agreement, the first $3.4 million is split 50-50, and anything on top of that is split two-thirds for Detroit and one-third for Hamtramck.

Hamtramck had said that without the revenue from the plant it would have a $2 million hole in its $18 million budget and would have to take drastic action such as a bankruptcy filing.
