Benoit Pouliot's top-shelf goal over Hendrik Lundqvist's right shoulder 6:03 into the third period sealed the Montreal Canadiens' win over the Rangers on Tuesday night at Madison Square Garden. Rangers center Brandon Dubinsky scored on an electric wrist shot 4:15 into the game, and the Blueshirts led until Montreal defenseman Jaroslav Spacek poked in an ugly goal with 1:11 left in the second. Habs goalie Alex Auld made 25 saves, while Mr. Lundqvist made 36 for New York.
