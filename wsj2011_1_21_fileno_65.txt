Members of the World Health Organization on Thursday backed efforts by the U.S. and Russia to keep the last known stocks of the smallpox virus for research to combat terrorism, in an initial debate over the fate over what is left of one of the world's most lethal pathogens. 

Smallpox was eradicated more than 30 years ago, but samples of the virus have been kept under tight security at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta and a Russian research center near Novosibirsk.

At a meeting in Geneva, the WHO's executive board supported the U.S. and Russian position that those stocks are needed to finish developing drugs and vaccines to counter a potential bioterror attack or accidental release of smallpox from unsanctioned stocks, officials familiar with the talks said.

The group, made up of representatives of 34 countries, had been asked to consider whether enough research has been done that a deadline to destroy the stocks could be set. Support for retaining them came from European and African nations in addition to the U.S. and Russia, among others, officials said. 

The debate will now move to the WHO's decision-making body, the World Health Assembly, which meets in May.
