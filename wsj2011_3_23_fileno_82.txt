Brandon Dubinsky broke up a scoreless game 7:49 into the third period and Henrik Lundqvist made 22 saves as the New York Rangers used defense to beat the Florida Panthers on Tuesday night and stretch their winning streak to a season-high five games.

New York had been surging on the strength of its offense that produced 17 goals in the previous three games — including at least five in each win. The Rangers have won seven of eight overall, scoring 34 goals in that stretch.
