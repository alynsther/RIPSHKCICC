SÃO PAULO—Brazil's federal government Friday authorized the presence of national security forces in the Amazon state of Rondonia after riots at the Jirau dam site halted construction on the 3,450 megawatt dam.

The government said Friday that it was sending additional police to the region to ensure public order. The additional police presence will last 30 days and can be renewed. 

Protesting workers at the Jirau dam have set fire to buses and damaged part of the worker housing at the site, according to media reports. Jirau is being built by  Energia Sustentavel do Brasil, a group comprising France's GDF Suez, Brazilian construction company Camargo Correa and Brazil's state-controlled utility  Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras, or Eletrobras. 

Workers have complained about wages and abuse by security officials at the site, according to local media. 

According to the local Estado news agency, the riots led the companies to remove remaining workers from the site and halt construction on the dam. The Jirau dam was set to begin operations in March 2012. The halt in construction could push back that date, Energia Sustentavel President  Victor Paranhos told Estado. 

GDF Suez, which coordinates media requests for the group, didn't immediately return calls seeking comment.
