MANNHEIM, Germanyâ€”German economic expectations deteriorated in March after the European Central Bank hinted that it may raise rates in April and following Japan's devastating earthquake. 

The ZEW think-tank said Tuesday its closely watched economic-expectations index decreased to 14.1 points in March from 15.7 points in February, following four consecutive increases. The outcome was below economists' forecasts of 15.7 points. 

"The German economy is in robust shape. Nevertheless, the tragic events in Japan could slow down the dynamics of German economic growth at least in the short run," said ZEW president  Wolfgang Franz.
