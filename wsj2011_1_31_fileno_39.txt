LONDON—European markets ended marginally lower as investors remained nervous about the growing unrest in Egypt. Banks, travel companies and car makers posted some of the biggest losses. 

The Stoxx Europe 600 index fell 0.1% to end at 280.05. The index recovered somewhat from earlier losses as gains on Wall Street boosted sentiment and the price of Brent crude oil flirted with the $100-per-barrel mark, bolstering oil companies. 

For the month of January, the Stoxx index rose 1.5%. A surprise increase in euro-zone inflation aided the euro as investors reasoned that the more prices rise, the more likely it is that the European Central Bank will have to raise interest rates. 

Traders kept an eye on Egypt, although worry about how the protests would affect markets began to fade. "Financial markets have reacted to the events by reducing exposures to the region as well as the exposure to risk in general," said Nordea Bank. "More negative news is required for the developments in North Africa to remain a key driver for global financial markets much beyond this week."

Still, protests intensified Monday as tens of thousands of people gathered in Cairo in a bid to oust President Hosni Mubarak. 

The main concern for markets is what would happen if unrest spreads to other countries, said  Andy Lynch, European equity-fund manager at Schroders. 

"The trigger point seems to have been the rise in food prices," Mr. Lynch said. 

That could be a worry for the likes of China and may result in authorities introducing tighter policies to try and keep inflation in check and food prices under control, he added. 

Auto stocks, which are particularly sensitive to expectations about China's growth, were among the biggest fallers in Europe. Daimler fell 2.5% in Frankfurt and Peugeot Citroen sank 1.2% in Paris. 

Financial stocks also dropped. Société Générale, which has a subsidiary in Egypt, fell more than 2%. In London, Royal Bank of Scotland Group slipped 2.4%. 

Dutch insurer Aegon dropped 2.4% after it was downgraded to "hold" from "buy" at Société Générale. 

Bucking the negative trend, France's CAC 40 edged up 0.1% to end at 4,005.50. Shares of Carrefour surged 5.3% after the retailer confirmed it was studying different projects that could lead to the listing of certain of its assets. Media reports said earlier that Carrefour shareholders were considering whether to split the company into three listed units. 

Luxury-goods firm Pinault-Printemps Redoute rose nearly 3% to €116.75 ($85.79). Exane BNP Paribas reiterated its "outperform" rating on the stock and raised its target price to €142 from €137. 

Drug giant  Sanofi-Aventis ended up 1.3%.  Genzyme said it will allow Sanofi-Aventis to conduct due diligence as talks between the two firms over a possible deal continue. 

Meanwhile, shares of cement firm Lafarge, which has large operations in Egypt, fell 1.7%.

Light, sweet, crude for March delivery was up $0.73 or 0.8% at $90.07 on the New York Mercantile Exchange by late afternoon in London.
