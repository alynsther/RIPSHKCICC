MUMBAI â€“ Indian apparel and textile company Raymond Ltd. will open as many as 100 new retail stores in the country next financial year, a senior executive said Friday. 

"We will have about 100 [more] stores by [next fiscal] year end... we have about 700 stores now," Raymond's chairman  Gautam Singhania told reporters. 

Raymond will spend at least 375 million rupees ($8.4 million) to open these stores in the financial year beginning April 1, the president of its apparel business,  Shreyas Joshi, said.

India is witnessing a resurgence in demand for items from clothes to cars from mostly young people--one of the largest such demographic groups in the world. Companies like Raymond and others serving the consumer goods market in India have been struggling to meet this demand. 

Raymond plans also to spend as much as 300 million rupees to launch a line of sunglasses in June to capitalize on its mainstay brand--Park Avenue. 

Revenue from the brand is likely to grow 30% in fiscal 2012 over the previous year, Mr. Joshi said without elaborating on how much the brand contributes to overall revenue. 

Raymond also owns brands such as Parx, Manzoni and ColorPlus. 

Mr. Singhania, who is also the managing director, said the company's plans to unlock value from the factory land in Thane, based in the western state of Maharashtra, are "on course." 

He didn't elaborate. 

In December 2009, Raymond closed the Thane unit and shifted operations to Vapi in Gujarat state. The company had then said it had plans to develop the land for commercial or residential use.
