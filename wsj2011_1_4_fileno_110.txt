Though he has scored just 14 points in his first season with the Bulls, Brian Scalabrine has become the fan favorite in Chicago that he was in Boston. Chants of "Scalabrine" rock the United Center when the Bulls lead big late in games, and the decibel level nearly crescendos when the 32-year-old redhead dives for a loose ball or unleashes a three-pointer. What's behind the craze? Mr. Scalabrine thinks it has something to do with his name. "Maybe it just sounds good coming off the tongue: Scal-ah-bree-nee," he said.

For 51 straight weeks, the Connecticut women's basketball team was No. 1 in the AP poll. But after Stanford snapped the Huskies' 90-game winning streak last Thursday, UConn finds itself ranked below another team for the first time since February 2008. The silver lining: The Huskies are just 11 points behind new No. 1 Baylor, and they received 14 first-place votes in this week's poll.

The epic rivalry between South Korea's Kim Yu-na and Japan's Mao Asada is flaring up again—but not between the two skaters. Ms. Kim's management company has lodged a complaint with a Japanese broadcaster for airing what it claims is hidden-camera footage showing Ms. Kim—wait for it—practicing. Last Sunday, Nippon Television Network broadcast a brief segment devoted to hunting down Ms. Kim in Los Angeles, where she's now based, and it included grainy footage of Ms. Kim on the rink. The TV clip lays bare Japan's fascination with Ms. Kim (pictured), who took the gold in Vancouver (Ms. Asada won silver). "The practice area is a public space," said Nippon TV spokesman Kenji Chikata, adding, "It's not the kind of story where we hid a camera in a bag."
