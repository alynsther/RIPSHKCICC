Thanks to an  Agatha Christie novel and  James Bond's "From Russia With Love," the Orient Express is as much a pop-culture phenomenon as a famous passenger train. The West Village bar of the same name takes full advantage of both references, making for an enjoyable ride. The narrow lounge—created by  Osman Cakir, an Istanbul native and antique collector who also owns the bar Turks and Frogs next door—has a curved ceiling, bronzed luggage racks and beechwood panels to evoke a European train car. The lighting is low; the mood is Old World romantic. 

The Nagelmackers, a cocktail named after the line's early manager, is an intense mix of rye, dark rum and port served in a glass rinsed in absinthe. The Agatha, a refreshing blend of gin, lemon and house-made strawberry-sage soda, is a local favorite. 

Food is a cut above most bar grub. Try the Hungarian sausage or the lighter chicken tarragon, both served in a cast-iron skillet.

 Orient Express, 325 W. 11th St. (west of Greenwich Street), opens at 5 p.m. daily; 212-691-8845
