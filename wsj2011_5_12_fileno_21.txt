PHNOM PENHâ€”A senior provincial official was sentenced to 19 years in prison, becoming the first person convicted under Cambodia's anticorruption law.

State prosecutor Pong Chan Soyutheara said Tob Chan Sereivuth, a former prosecutor in Pursat province, was convicted Thursday of extortion and accepting bribes to release timber smugglers.

He said three men who worked with Chan Sereivuth were sentenced to 15, 16 and 18 years, respectively, on extortion charges and ordered them to pay compensation to the victims. All four were arrested late last year, just months after the anticorruption act became law.

Cambodia, a poor country heavily dependent on foreign aid, is routinely listed by groups such as Transparency International as one of the most corrupt in Asia.

The country has started to come onto many investors' radar screens in recent years after stabilizing its political system following years of war and chaos since the 1970s. Many foreign companies are looking for new places to set up manufacturing operations in Asia as wages climb in China, and Cambodia, with its large pool of young and under-employed workers, is one of the newest contenders.

But the country's reputation for corruption remains a deterrent for some companies. It has also led to conflicts with international aid donors, whose funds provide a substantial source of income for the country. The government has committed to curbing corruption, including through its anti-corruption law, but many investors and donors have remained skeptical.
