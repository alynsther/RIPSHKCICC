Mets left fielder Jason Bay returned to the team Thursday after missing two games for a reason that, in an earlier generation of baseball, would have been inexcusable: His wife had a baby.

Bay's wife, Kristen, gave birth Wednesday night to the couple's third child, Garrett David, and under Major League Baseball's paternity leave policy, he was allowed to be with his family without costing the Mets a roster spot. (Lucas Duda had replaced Bay on the roster.)

 MLB instituted the policy this season after general managers had raised the issue at their annual off-season meetings. An MLB spokesman said. the GMs believed players felt guilty about having to choose whether to accompany their wives or leave their teams shorthanded. After quickly reaching an agreement with the players association, MLB made the policy adjustment. 

It was a departure from the macho, unwritten rule that once the regular season began, a player didn't abandon his teammates for any personal matter.

"Nobody left," said Mets manager Terry Collins, who got his first major-league coaching job with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1992 after managing in the minors for 11 years.

Mets broadcaster Ron Darling, a major-league pitcher for 13 years, said he and his ex-wife made sure she was induced on an off-day to make sure he wouldn't be away from his team too long. "And I only pitched every five days," Darling said.

Bay hustled to Citi Field Thursday morning and went 1-for-3 and scored a run in the Mets' 5-2 victory over the Giants.
