MUMBAI -- India can deregulate diesel prices when the pace of inflation shows some signs of easing, the chairman of the Indian Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council said Monday.

"I think we should choose the right time for deregulating the diesel prices. The right time would be when inflation rate is somewhat coming down. Perhaps some time during the course of next year [financial year beginning Apr. 1] the diesel decontrol can also come into operation," C. Rangarajan told CNBC-TV18.

He said that since diesel price deregulation wouldn't require legislative approval, it would be easier to implement than other reforms, such as raising the foreign direct investment cap in insurance.

In June, India deregulated gasoline prices and said diesel prices would be deregulated later. Raising diesel prices is a highly sensitive issue in India as it leads to a rise in input costs and freight charges.

Mr. Rangarajan said the wholesale price index-based headline inflation rate is likely to ease to 6% by the end of March and added that the Reserve Bank of India's decision on any further rate hike at its next policy meeting will depend on the movement of prices in January.

The RBI's next rate-setting meeting is scheduled for Jan. 25.

According to recent government data, headline inflation eased to 7.48% in November from 8.58% a month earlier, but was well above the RBI's estimate of 5.5% by March end.

"If the inflation rate shows some signs of decline, then perhaps we could continue with the present stance of monetary policy. But if, on the other hand, if the inflation continues to remain sticky, action on the part of monetary authorities will be required," Mr. Rangarajan said.

He added that capital inflows have been "reasonable" during the current financial year and haven't caused any "distortions" in the economy.
