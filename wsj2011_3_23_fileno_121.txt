A lead actress in "Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark" was injured last week during an onstage battle scene, making her the fifth cast member to be hurt in the troubled production, representatives for the actress and the musical confirmed Tuesday.

The actress, T.V. Carpio, replaced Natalie Mendoza in the role of Arachne after Ms. Mendoza quit the musical in December to recover from a concussion sustained when she was hit backstage by a weighted rope.

Ms. Carpio suffered whiplash after colliding with another actor during one of the musical's final moments, according to her representatives. Though the role of Arachne involves numerous technically complex aerial moves, Ms. Carpio's March 16 accident didn't occur during one those stunts, they said.

Ms. Carpio didn't perform for the past week and is expected to sit out another week.

While Ms. Carpio skips performances "on doctors' orders," she will be replaced by actress America Olivo, a spokesman for the production, Rick Miramontez, said in a statement.

Arachne, also known as the show's Spider-Woman, is the signature creation of director Julie Taymor, who shepherded the $70 million musical for the past nine years until she was effectively demoted about two weeks ago by producers.

Federal and state agencies investigated "Spider-Man" in response to accidents resulting in cast-member injuries. Earlier this month, federal officials recommended $12,600 in fines after citing the show for three serious safety violations.
