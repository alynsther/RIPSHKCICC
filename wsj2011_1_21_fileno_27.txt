A strong reading for a German economic-sentiment index and solid gains by the financial sector propelled European markets higher Friday.

—

Among big gainers, Royal Bank of Scotland Group jumped 6.5% on hopes it will leave a government bad-asset program early.

The Stoxx Europe 600 index rose 0.7% to close at 281.26. While this ended a two-session losing streak, the benchmark posted a weekly loss of 0.9%.

Stocks added to gains as U.S. markets rose in the wake of upbeat earnings from General Electric, among other major companies. Early afternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.3% at 11861.13.

Investors in Europe took inspiration from the German Ifo business-climate index, which rose to a record 110.3 for January, slightly stronger than the 110 reading expected and up from 109.8 last month.

"This should help Germany's industrial production return to pre-crisis levels by 2012," economists at Exane BNP Paribas, said in a research note.

In Frankfurt, the DAX 30 index  finished up 0.5% at 7062.42 but slipped 0.2% for the week. Conglomerate  Siemens  added 1.9% as media reports said the engineering company will add 2,000 jobs a its renewable-energy business unit.

  Lars Christensen, chief analyst at Danske Bank, wasn't convinced there was anything concrete pushing markets higher. He said he thought the markets were on a "little bit of shaky ground right now," following losses seen in the previous two sessions.

A report in the Financial Times said Royal Bank of Scotland could exit the U.K. government's asset-protection program, set up to protect banks against bad or risky assets, by the end of this year. That gave a boost to the banking sector, with  Lloyds Banking Group climbing 0.8% in London.

In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 0.5% to 5896.25, getting a helping hand as well from  AstraZeneca, which rose 1.4% on renewed hopes for its blood-thinning drug Brilinta. But the index fell 1.8% for the week, snapping two weeks of gains. 

Financial stocks provided support across other European markets.

In Paris, the CAC 40 index rose 1.3% to 4017.45, taking it to its third straight weekly gain and a 2011 high.  Crédit Agricole [ACA] rose 3.3%,  Société Générale gained 2.6% and  BNP Paribas added 2.2%.

The Spanish IBEX 35 index rose 1.8% to 10829.10, with heavyweights Banco Santander gaining 3.8% and BBVA trading up 3.3%. 

Spain's markets received a boost on word that the Spanish government will soon present a plan to lift the transparency of savings banks. Some reports have said the government is planning a partial state takeover of its weakest savings banks, or cajas, to build investor confidence in the country. It will also seek to list those banks on the markets, reports said.

Another big gainer was  ASML Holding, which rose 3.5% in Amsterdam.

Morgan Stanley raised its rating to "overweight" from "underweight," and boosted its price target. It predicts a "technology race" between the Dutch chip-equipment maker and chip maker Intel, helping drive a longer business cycle for companies such as ASML.

That inspired gains among other semiconductor stocks. In London,  ARM Holdings
