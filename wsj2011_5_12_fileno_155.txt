Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said Wednesday that he would seek the Republican presidential nomination, posting an Internet video that made overtures to the tea-party movement and took subtle swipes at the Obama administration.

"There are some people who don't mind if America becomes a wreck, as long as they dominate the wreckage," Mr. Gingrich, 67 years old, said in the video on his website. "But you and I know better."

In a nod to advocates of a smaller federal government, Mr. Gingrich spoke of building a "country that is decentralized under the 10th Amendment, with power once again back with the American people and away from the Washington bureaucracy." The 10th Amendment says that powers the Constitution does not assign to the federal government accrue to the states. Tea-party activists often cite it in complaining of federal overreach.

Mr. Gingrich also announced his candidacy in a message on Twitter, the microblogging site, where his 1.3 million followers far outnumber those of rival GOP candidates Mitt Romney and Tim Pawlenty.

Mr. Gingrich is considered a master political tactician but has never won elected office beyond his former Atlanta-area House district. 

First sent to Washington in 1978, Mr. Gingrich was the architect of the Republicans' 1994 takeover of the House, but he left office in 1999 after his party lost seats in the 1998 midterm elections.

Since then, Mr. Gingrich, who has been married three times, has tried to build bridges to social conservatives, tea-party groups and other parts of the Republican base. 

He has built a network of policy and outreach groups devoted to health care, religion in public life and other topics that have raised millions of dollars and developed large email and donor lists.
