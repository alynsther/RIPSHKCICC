Air Canada has threatened to withdraw its sponsorship of the National Hockey League unless the league does more to crack down on violent on-ice incidents. The air carrier expressed its concerns in a letter to NHL commissioner Gary Bettman after Tuesday's hit by Boston Bruins' captain Zdeno Chara left Montreal Canadiens' forward Max Pacioretty with a severe concussion and a cracked vertebra. Bettman called the Pacioretty injury "horrific," but added the league is comfortable not seeking further punishment against Chara. He fired back at Air Canada, saying that it's Air Canada's prerogative on how it spends its sponsorship dollars, but NHL clubs that fly Air Canada also have the right to fly another airline. Air Canada declined to comment.

For only the second time since 2000, nine of the top 10 men in the ATP World Tour singles rankings are also entered in doubles at an event. Players are using this week's BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, Calif., to sharpen their early-season form. Last year, Rafael Nadal and partner Marc Lopez won the event. With so many top players entered, but unseeded due to their lack of doubles pedigree, some delicious matchups could emerge. Then again, a high singles ranking means little in doubles: Nadal and Novak Djokovic teamed up in Toronto last year but lost their first match.
