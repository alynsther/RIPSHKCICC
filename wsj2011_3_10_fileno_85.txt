How often teams receive at-large bids to the NCAA tournament, based on their range in the RPI (2001-10):

Each year, college-basketball experts and insiders say the same thing about the Ratings Percentage Index: The ranking, which assesses a team's performance and strength of schedule, is just one tool that the selection committee uses to choose the tournament field.

But if you look at recent history, it actually offers a very detailed blueprint for which teams are going to get in.

Over the past 10 years, a team's odds of getting an at-large bid have corresponded reliably to its RPI rank, with the chances declining in a predictable manner as a candidate's RPI gets worse. This holds true even among small RPI ranges: At-large candidates ranked in the 41-45 range have made the tournament 67% of the time since 2001, compared to 44% for the 46-50 range and 23% for the 51-55 spectrum. To be sure, everyone's chances of making the tournament are better this season, since the field is 68 teams now, up from 65. 

This is good news for bubble teams with relatively solid RPI rankings like Georgia (37th) and Boston College (43rd), who have a statistical edge over Colorado (76th) and Richmond (57th). Then again, RPI is hardly everything, and no program knows this better than Missouri State does. The Bears, who are on the bubble again this season (46th), have finished with a top-40 RPI three times since 2000 but have been left out of the NCAAs each time.
