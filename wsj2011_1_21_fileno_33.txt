WASHINGTONâ€”President Barack Obama will announce Friday that Jeffrey Immelt, chief executive of General Electric Co., will head a new White House board aimed at finding ways to foster private-sector job growth.

The board will replace an existing panel called the President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board, led by former Federal Reserve chairman  Paul Volcker.

The name of the new panel stresses competitiveness and job creation, which are expected to be themes of Mr. Obama's State of the Union Address next week. It will be called the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness.

Mr. Immelt also served on the previous panel. Mr. Volcker will not join the new council.

Putting a prominent chief executive atop a panel is the latest gesture by the White House toward strengthening ties to business. 

In recent weeks, Mr. Obama reached a free trade agreement with Korea; named a banking executive,  William Daley, to be his chief of staff; and promised to review regulations for their impact on business, particularly small companies. 

"As we enter a new phase in our recovery, I have asked the new council to focus its work on finding new ways to encourage the private sector to hire and invest in American competitiveness," Mr. Obama said in a statement.

The board led by Mr. Volcker, an economist, was created with a two-year mandate that expires on Feb. 6. It was charged with crafting the administration's response to the financial crisis.

On Friday, the president and Mr. Immelt are scheduled to tour the GE plant in Schenectady, N.Y., home to the company's largest energy division and the future home of GE's advanced battery manufacturing facility.
