Ryan Callahan scored four goals and notched an assist in a dominating victory over the sliding Philadelphia Flyers on Sunday.

Callahan scored twice in the first period to give New York a 2-0 lead, added another in the second when the edge grew to 4-0 and netted his 20th of the season in the third with a goal off of his skate.

New York got top-line forward Marian Gaborik back in the lineup following a concussion. 

Henrik Lundqvist was sharp, making 24 saves in his NHL-leading ninth shutout, but he didn't need to be to shut down the sluggish Flyers, who have dropped a season worst four in a row.
