It wasn't the promotion Wally Backman was hoping for, but it was a promotion nonetheless. 

The Mets named Mr. Backman manager of their Double-A affiliate in Binghamton on Monday, two months after denying him the major-league managerial job. 

Mr. Backman, a fan favorite from his playing days with the Mets, spent 2010 managing the Class-A Brooklyn Cyclones. 

He was one of four finalists to replace Jerry Manuel as manager of the Mets in November, but the Mets opted for the more-experienced Terry Collins.

Now, Mr. Backman is moving up the minor-league ladder. He led the Cyclones to a 51-24 record in 2010.

 It was his first time working in a major-league organization since he was hired and abruptly fired as manager of the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2004 for failing to disclose past legal issues.

That embarrassing episode made it difficult for him to get a job with a major-league team again. But the Mets gave him a shot at redemption in 2010.

"It's exciting to be with the Mets," Mr. Backman said Monday in a statement released by the team. "It was almost like a homecoming coming back to the Mets last year."

Mr. Backman, a 51-year-old former second baseman, is best known by Mets fans for his role on the 1986 championship team. 

That team could have also included Troy Aikman, had things worked out differently.

The Hall of Fame quarterback who is now a well-known football commentator for Fox Sports told HBO's "Real Sports" in an interview that will air Tuesday night that the Mets tried to sign him before he enrolled at the University of Oklahoma in 1984. 

Mr. Aikman, a former high school pitcher and shortstop, said, "They said, 'We need to know what it's gonna take to get you to forgo college.' â€¦ I said, 'I don't know, $200,000.'

"They said, '$200,000? Darryl Strawberry is not even making that much money.' And I said, 'Well if you want me, that's what it's gonna take.' And they said, 'You have a nice football career at Oklahoma.'"
