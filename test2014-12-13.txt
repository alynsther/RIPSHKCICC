BANGKOK—The commoner wife of the heir to the Thai throne has given up her
royal status, a palace statement said, following a corruption investigation
that has implicated some of her relatives.

Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn ’s staff last month asked the government to
strip Princess Srirasmi’s family of their royally bestowed
surname—Akkarapongpreecha—after several of her family members were arrested on
charges ranging from bribery to bringing the monarchy into disrepute by
invoking its name for their own business...

WAGING, Germany—When this Alpine town’s long-serving Santa announced he would

**LOOK AT THIS** [dessert’s brief list of ingredients](http://www.wsj.com/articles/recipe-muscovado-pudding-1418322313?tesla=y) and you might think it’s missing something. It’s not. I’ve dubbed it a pudding because it is British in origin, and because I don’t know what else to call it. However you wish to categorize it, it’s perfect just as it is.

#### Related Recipe

  * [Muscovado Pudding](http://www.wsj.com/articles/recipe-muscovado-pudding-1418322313?tesla=y)

I first had it inside a tart crust at London’s Little Social—one of the
restaurants in chef  Jason Atherton’s empire. That tart was served most
extravagantly with a black-sesame crumble and a scoop of crème-fraîche sorbet.
Elegant in texture, with an exceptional depth of flavor, the filling needed
neither the crust, I decided, nor the other embellishments. Most chefs believe
that no plate is complete without contrasting textures and flavors to excite
the palate. In theory, I agree. But there are moments when you want to close
your eyes and just have that perfect bite of pudding, uninterrupted. Forgive
me, Jason Atherton, for running amok with your beautifully composed dessert.
Or rather, apologies to Cary Docherty, the head chef at Little Social, who
came up with the recipe.

I strongly advise using a very rich, non-homogenized heavy cream; in New York,
where I live, the one produced by Ronnybrook Farm Dairy is an excellent
option. The final result will be, well, creamier than a pudding made with the
ultrapasteurized variety. A garnish of [flaky Maldon sea
salt](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303433304579304433080091984)
adds intrigue, but keep it sparse. The choice between light and dark muscovado
sugar is yours. I use dark, as I like its hint of molasses; at the restaurant,
they use light; in a pinch, dark brown sugar may be substituted. A warning,
though: Few kitchen burns are worse than one inflicted by molten sugar. Choose
a high-sided saucepan (I use a pasta pot) and wear oven mitts when pouring the
cream into the caramelized sugar, as it may splatter.

I’ve prepared this dessert in deep pie plates and shallower tart dishes. It
also works in individual ramekins or even teacups. For festive meals, when
proper pies and tarts are in order, you may, of course, do as Mr. Docherty
does at Little Social and pour it into a par-baked sweet [pastry crust](http:/
/www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887323419604578569642497067224). But
as a plain pudding, it will carry you far beyond the holidays. The few
ingredients it requires never go out of season and are easy to keep on hand,
ready to sweeten a long, wintry night.

**THE CURE FOR** winter’s chill is often a crackling fire or a steaming [mug of hot chocolate](http://www.wsj.com/articles/diy-aquavit-recipe-1417801674?tesla=y). The cure for cabin fever is more elusive. Winter festivals exist not just to celebrate the season, but also to provide an excuse for an outing. The best fests seem to understand that it takes more than a band and some beer to make a trip worthwhile; many reward visitors with grand spectacles and oddball events. Here, a few events that guarantee a cool, cold time.

###### A Capital of Cold in China

The city of Harbin is closer to the Russian and Mongolian borders than it is
to Beijing—and for two months a year, it turns that frosty location to its
advantage. For the **Harbin International Ice and Snow Festival**, a frozen
city covering 8 million square feet is built from snow as well as ice pulled
from the Songhua River. (The centerpieces of this year’s festival will be a
160-foot-tall “fairy tower” made of ice and steel, and a frozen replica of Big
Ben.) Everything is lit from within in rainbow hues, so this festival is best
visited after dark. And there’s more to do than just gawk: This year’s
activity district will include ice skating, ice biking and an eight-sided ice
slide. But only the bravest visitors will want to join locals swimming in the
frigid Songhua. _Jan. 5 to Feb. 25, 2015,

###### Ice Dream in New York

Ice Harvest Festival Kevin Q Gray

In February, time isn’t the only thing frozen at the Hanford Mills Museum in
upstate New York. Before refrigeration, ice was as important to rural life as
any other crop; the museum honors that past with its annual **Ice Harvest
Festival**. Attendees can strap on ice cleats and venture onto the frozen mill
pond to watch—or help—as 6 to 8 tons of ice is removed in huge blocks, using
antique tools. The ice is packed away in an icehouse until it is used to make
ice cream for Independence Day. The winter event is not without its own
treats: Visitors can warm themselves by a bonfire, hit the soup buffet or ride
in a horse-drawn sleigh. _Feb. 7, 2015,

BE682_WINFES_P_20141211143119.jpg) ENLARGE

Carnaval de Québec  CARNAVAL DE QUÉBEC

Billed as the largest winter carnival in the world, with more than half a
million visitors, **Carnaval de Québec **sprawls from Quebec City’s Plains of
Abraham park onto the St. Lawrence River and the snow-covered city streets.
Between the opening ceremony (at a palace built from 300 tons of ice) and the

###### Snow Daze in Alaska

Fur Rendezvous Corbis

Pamplona, Spain, may have the Running of the Bulls, but Anchorage does that
town one better with the Running of the Reindeer. That’s just one of the many
events in the **Fur Rendezvous** (“The Rondy”), where Alaskans get to let out
a little of the crazy that’s bound to build up over the long winter. Athletic
fun ranges from leaf-blower hockey and snowshoe softball to _yukigassen,_ a
Japanese team sport that combines Capture the Flag with a snowball fight. At
the Miners and Trappers Ball, the winner of the Alaska State Championship
Beard and Moustache Contest is awarded the coveted title “Mr. Fur Face.” Come
for the carnival, the parades and the native art market; stay for the outhouse
races. _Feb. 27 to March 8, [furrondy.net](http://www.furrondy.net) _

###### Frozen Family Fun in Minnesota

Saint Paul Winter Carnival Christine Wisch

You don’t need to understand the Byzantine, made-up mythology surrounding the
**Saint Paul Winter Carnival** to know it’s the premiere event on the Twin
Cities’ cold-weather calendar. The struggle for power between Boreas (King of
the Winds) and the Fire King informs many events—the closing torchlight parade
culminates in the overthrow of King Boreas on the steps of the James J. Hill
Library. In the 10 days before that, families throng the Winter Wonderland in
Rice Park and cheer on their favorite ‘bots in the Autonomous Snowplow
Competition; others participate in a countywide treasure hunt, seeking a gold
medallion that comes with a $10,000 prize. The outdoor Beer Dabbler festival,
with more than 150 breweries represented, draws masses to the tundra of the
Minnesota State Fairgrounds. _Jan. 22 to Feb. 1, 2015,

New York City subway crews failed to identify and correct several defects in a
section of track in Queens that likely caused the transit system’s worst
derailment in more than two decades, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority
said Friday.

The authority said its investigation into the May 2 derailment zeroed in on
three defective components that primarily led to a Manhattan-bound F express
to break a rail and jump its tracks,...

After taking to New York City streets in the past few weeks to rally against
what they see as police violence, protesters are planning to gather by the
tens of thousands to demonstrate again on Saturday.

The thousands who have marched have been inspired by grand jury decisions not
to indict white police officers in the death of two unarmed black men in
confrontations with police: Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., and Eric Garner on
Staten Island. The New York protests, so far largely peaceful, have drawn
support from public...

WASHINGTON—Conservative Republicans forced the Senate into a rare weekend

bill funding the government through next September.

Senate leaders had initially hoped to reach an agreement to vote Friday on the

the House Thursday night, but were unable to coax all 100 Senate lawmakers to
go along with an agreement to do so. A plan to push a procedural vote until
