LONDONâ€”Iran's president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has dismissed three key ministers, including the oil minister, as part of a proposed merger between ministries, the president's website said Saturday. 

The move comes amid mounting tensions between Mr. Ahmadinejad on one side and lawmakers and the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei on the other. In addition to oil minister Masoud Mirkazemi, Industry and Mines minister Ali Akbar Mehrabian has also been removed, the statement on the presidential website said. 

The decisions are part of a restructuring that should see the number of government departments cut from 21 to 17. 

The presidential statement also said the minister of welfare and social security Sadeq Mahsouli had been dismissed. 

The 2009 nomination of Mr. Mirkazemi, a former revolutionary guard with no oil experience, was controversial, but he had been nominated with the president's backing. 

Government officials have previously said current energy minister Majid Namjou could take the helm of a merged energy and oil ministry. However, Mr. Namjou barely avoided impeachment in parliament in March. 

Lawmakers have insisted any new nomination would need their approval.
