Brook Lopez and Jordan Farmar each scored 24 points, combining for all eight of the Nets' points in overtime, as they rallied to beat the Los Angeles Clippers Friday night for their fourth straight victory in Newark.

Kris Humphries had 19 points and a career-high 20 rebounds and made all eight shots while playing All-Star Blake Griffin to at least a draw. The Nets erased a 20-point deficit for their longest winning streak since also taking four in a row two years ago.
