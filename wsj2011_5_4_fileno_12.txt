British police said they have released without charge five men arrested under terrorism laws near a nuclear plant in northwest England. 

The arrests on Monday came amid government alerts around the world for potential reprisals following the killing of al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden this week. 

"Officers have conducted a thorough investigation and a decision has been made to release the five men without charge," the police said in a statement Wednesday. 

The arrests were made after police officers from Britain's Civil Nuclear Constabulary conducted a stop check on a vehicle close to the Sellafield nuclear power plant. Police also searched four addresses in East London. 

Britain sees itself as being particularly high on any potential revenge list and has been targeted by al Qaeda inspired terrorism before, including the deaths of 56 people in an attack on the London transport system in 2005.
