BERLINâ€”German retail sales dropped further than expected in March, as consumer confidence took a hit amid uncertainty from the earthquake and nuclear crisis in Japan and unrest in the Middle East and North Africa. 

Retail sales fell 2.1% from a month earlier in March in price-adjusted terms, after falling 0.4% in February, the Federal Statistics office said Friday. Economists had forecast a 0.4% monthly drop in retail sales in March. 

Retail sales declined 3.5% year-to-year. 

Food, drink and tobacco sales fell 4.8% from March 2010 in price-adjusted terms, and non-food sales fell 2.4%. 

Analysts cautioned that while global uncertainty was a matter of concern for consumers, the overall trend remained positive. 

"The official monthly data are chronically volatile and in general prone to later upward revisions," said  Alexander Koch, an economist for UniCredit in Munich. "All in all, this signals a continuation of the recovery in total household spending at the beginning of the year." 

Market research group GfK suggested Wednesday that German consumer sentiment was set to weaken further as rising inflation and turmoil in North Africa weigh on consumers' minds. GfK's forward-looking consumer-climate index for May fell to 5.7 points from 5.9 in April, compared with a three-year high of 6.0 in March, the research group said. 

The rate of inflation continues to tick upward, with the federal statistics office reporting Wednesday that consumer prices rose 2.4% from a year earlier in April, up from 2.1% from a year earlier in March.
