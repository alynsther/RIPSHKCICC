DENVERâ€”Mets starting pitcher Chris Young has re-torn the anterior capsule in his right shoulder and could require season-ending surgery, Mets assistant general manager John Ricco said Monday.

The shoulder has ailed him since 2009 and is the main reason the Mets were able to sign him at the bargain rate of $1.1 million. It is the same injury that limited Young to just four games in 2010.

Ricco said Young is mulling whether to undergo surgery or attempt to rehab the injury, as he did last year. 

But either way, it appears Young's season is over. In four starts, he was the Mets' most effective pitcher, going 1-0 with a 1.88 ERA.

Young was scheduled to start Saturday against the Los Angeles Dodgers but was scratched when he could not get loose during pregame warm-ups.

 Dillon Gee will take his place in the starting rotation.

Also Monday, top pitching prospect Jenrry Mejia saw Dr. James Andrews, who concurred with team doctors' recommendation that he undergo Tommy John surgery to repair a torn medial collateral ligament in his right elbow.

 Mejia will undergo surgery at a date to be determined.
