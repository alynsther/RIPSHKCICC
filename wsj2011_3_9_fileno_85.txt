WASHINGTONâ€”The Justice Department on Tuesday appealed a Florida judge's January ruling that declared the new health-care law unconstitutional. 

The case will now move to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta. 



U.S. District Court Judge Roger Vinson voided the law in January but stayed his ruling last week, conditioned upon the Obama administration's appealing it within seven days. He also required the government to seek expedited appellate review. 

Judge Vinson had ruled unconstitutional the law's requirement that individuals carry health coverage or pay a penalty. 

The case involved a legal challenge by 26 states, two individuals and the National Federation of Independent Business. 

Two other federal appeals courts, in Richmond, Va., and Cincinnati, are preparing to consider the constitutionality of the law late this spring.
