TUCSON, Ariz. -- A victim of last weekend's shooting rampage here was arrested Saturday during a televised town hall meeting after telling a tea party leader, "you're dead," law enforcement authorities said.

James Fuller, 63, was taken to a local hospital for a psychiatric evaluation after the incident, said Pima County Deputy Sheriff Jason Ogan.

Mr. Fuller, during a town hall meeting sponsored by ABC on the Jan. 8 shootings, turned around shortly before 1 p.m. and snapped a picture of tea party leader Trent Humphries, Mr. Ogan said.

After telling Mr. Humphries, "you're dead," Mr. Fuller chanted "boo" from his chair, according to police.

Mr. Humphries, who wasn't immediately reached for comment, is an organizer of the Tucson Tea Party. 

Mr. Fuller was arrested on charges of threats and intimidation and disorderly conduct, both misdemeanors. 

Mr. Ogan said he didn't know what upset Mr. Fuller on Saturday. Sheriff's deputies took Mr. Fuller to a hospital the evaluation following his arrest.

Mr. Fuller was shot a week ago while attending a constituent event held by Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, an Arizona Democrat who won a close race against a tea party-backed challenger last fall.

Jared Lee Loughner, 22 years old, is accused of killing six people at Ms. Giffords's event and shooting 14 more who survived, including Ms. Giffords and Mr. Fuller. Ms. Giffords, who was shot in the head, remains in critical condition. 

The Tucson Tea Party has said it is "incredible saddened by the evil and atrocious violence" and said the shooting "is not to be condoned."
