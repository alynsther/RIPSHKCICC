MUMBAI â€“ Jet Airways (India) Ltd. will pay Sahara India Commercial Corp. 4.78 billion rupees ($107.5 million) in the next two weeks, after a high court ruled the airline defaulted on payment obligations in its acquisition of Sahara Airlines, a senior executive said Wednesday. 

"However, out of the total amount payable to Sahara, the net cash outgo for the company will only be 1.16 billion rupees," M. Shivkumar, said Jet Airways' senior vice president for finance. 

Shares of India's biggest airline by market share slid on the news of the court's ruling and finished 4.7% down at 447.30 rupees. The Mumbai market closed 0.4% lower. The payment is expected to further strain Jet Airways, already hit by rising fuel and interest costs, even as India's air traffic is on the rise. 

Mr. Shivkumar said the rest of the money has been deposited in the Bombay High Court as payment installments and will be partly adjusted from previous tax payments Jet Airways made on behalf of Sahara Airlines. 

Jet Airways bought the airline company from Sahara for 14.50 billion rupees in 2007, agreeing to pay 9 billion rupees immediately and the remaining 5.50 billion rupees in four equal installments. It re-branded the carrier into a low-fare airline, JetLite. 

Jet Airways had paid the first two installments before Sahara India took it to court in 2009, accusing the airline of defaulting on payments and saying the total purchase price should be 20 billion rupees.

The Press Trust of India in a report earlier Wednesday said the Bombay High Court has mandated Jet to pay 4.78 billion rupees to Sahara India but rejected the latter's petition on the higher 20 billion rupees purchase price. 

Mr. Shivkumar also said once Jet Airways pays the amount, it will be free to sell and leaseback its planes--a move it was earlier barred from--since it couldn't touch some assets during the case.
