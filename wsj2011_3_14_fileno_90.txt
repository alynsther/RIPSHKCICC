As if any more evidence was needed that Mariano Rivera is an ageless freak of nature, the Yankee closer delivered yet another awe-inspiring performance Sunday in his first outing of the spring.

After a winter spent without throwing, and a much less intensive spring program than any other Yankee pitcher, Rivera finally took the mound Sunday. He struck out the side, blowing away the overmatched Minnesota Twins in order—and then went for a run because his outing was so fast he didn't get a full workout in.

He was asked which was tougher, the dominant outing or the run. "I think the running," Rivera laughed.

The Yankees trimmed down their roster for the first time this spring, slicing off 11 players as the regular season draws nearer.

Pitchers Andy Sisco, Brian Anderson, David Phelps, Adam Warren and Buddy Carlyle were re-assigned to minor-league camp, while Hector Noesi was optioned to Triple-A Scranton. Position players Austin Krum, Daniel Brewer and Bradley Suttle were also sent to minor-league camp.

Two other players left the organization for good: Lefty pitcher Robert Fish was claimed on waivers by the Kansas City Royals, while righty pitcher Daniel Turpen, selected from Boston in the Rule 5 draft, was returned to the Red Sox.

The Mets will begin selling single-game tickets at 10 a.m. on Monday. In the wake of a precipitous attendance drop to 2.56 million last year from 3.17 million in 2009, the team has lowered ticket prices and created more than 60 promotion, theme and heritage dates among its 81 regular-season home games. The latest addition is Pyrotechnics Night on Friday, July 15.
