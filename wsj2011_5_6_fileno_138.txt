TORONTO—Members of the Canadian armed forces deployed to help thousands of residents displaced by the worst flooding in Quebec in 150 years, amid record rainfall.

Federal Natural Resources Minister Christian Paradis said Thursday that 650 troops have been deployed to the Richelieu Valley, southeast of Montreal, to assist with the flooding there. The troops were requested by the government of Quebec, Canada's French-speaking province on the other side of the border with the U.S. northeast. Mr. Paradis said 700 homes have been evacuated.

The affected area has been hit by record amounts of rainfall in the past two weeks. Canadian environment-ministry meteorologist Andre Cantin said up to two inches of rain has fallen in the St.-Jean-sur-Richelieu area in the past 48 hours. Average rainfall for the month of April in the area is about 2.4 inches.

The situation has been aggravated by heavy rains just south of the Richelieu Valley, he said. More than three inches of rain fell in the Lake Champlain region of Vermont, just across the U.S. border, over just two days last week.

Up to another three-fourths of an inch of rain is expected in the Richelieu Valley over the next day or so, Mr. Cantin said.

Lake Champlain, which feeds the Richelieu River, has risen to a record 103.1 feet above sea level, the U.S. National Weather Service said. Its long-term average is just under 96 feet above sea level, and flooding begins when it reaches 100 feet above sea level.

  Pierre Corbin, founder of Hydro-Meteo, a private company that monitors water levels for the province of Quebec, said the Richelieu River was at its highest level in 150 years. He said it could be weeks before water levels return to normal.
