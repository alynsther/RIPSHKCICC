MUMBAIâ€”Indian shares broke a three-session losing run Tuesday, tracking advances in other Asian markets and as falling crude-oil prices boosted market sentiment among investors wary of high inflation. 

The Bombay Stock Exchange's Sensitive Index rose 149.25 points, or 0.8%, to 17988.30. Volume on the BSE fell to 29.43 billion rupees ($654 million) from Monday's 30.44 billion rupees. Advancers outnumbered decliners 1,555 to 1,294, with 134 stocks unchanged. Among the 30 Sensex constituents, 25 ended higher.

On the National Stock Exchange, the 50-stock S&P CNX Nifty rose 49.10 points, or 0.9%, to 5413.85. 

In Asia, Japan's Nikkei jumped 4.4%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.8% and China's Shanghai Composite rose 0.3%. 

"The softening in Brent crude and the gains in the rupee have helped the Sensex hold at higher levels, but the market is still largely range-bound," said  D.D. Sharma, head of equity research at Anand Rathi Securities. 

ICE Brent crude futures for April delivery slipped below $115 a barrel and were last at $114.70, down 21 cents. 

Analysts expect crude prices to soften in April once there is greater clarity about the effect of the strife in the Middle East and North Africa, with the Indian market trading in a narrow range until then. 

Reliance Industries, which has a 12.5% weighting in the Sensex, climbed 1.1% to 999.5 rupees following a media report that the company is seeking an increase in the price of the gas it pumps from the D6 block in the Krishna-Godavari basin, off India's east coast. 

It is unlikely that the government will agree to a price increase as a ministerial panel has fixed the price at $4.20 a million British thermal unit until 2014, said  Jagdish Meghnani, vice president of equity research at Alchemy Share & Stock Brokers.

Some software companies rose on bargain buying after having shed 4% to 5% in the past week.  Infosys Technologies, which carries the second highest weighting in the Sensex, rose 0.7% to 2,943.4 rupees. Wipro inched up 0.1% to 434.05 rupees. 

Among other advancers, State Bank of India, the country's largest bank by assets, rose 1.5% to 2,620.95 rupees. Telecommunications company Bharti Airtel climbed 2.7% to 325.85 rupees.
