For the first time ever, the number of runners crossing the finish line annually in U.S. marathons passed the half-million mark in 2010, at 507,000, according to a report released Wednesday by Running USA, an industry-supported research group based in Colorado Springs, Colo.

The 2010 number exceeded by almost 9% the 2009 field of finishers, representing the second-largest jump in the past 25 years, behind the previous year's spike of about 10%. In the view of some running experts, the recession inadvertently gave a boost to a sport that costs relatively little and can help combat stress.

The 2011 numbers appear likely to jump even more dramatically, because several popular races have sold out in record time. The Boston Marathon did so in eight hours, the Marine Corps race in Washington, D.C., in 28 hours and the Chicago event this coming October in 31 days. Many other 2011 marathons are also filled up.

But helping handle demand is an ever-growing number of new marathons. More than 35 new marathons – a record number – launched in 2010, according to Running USA, bringing the total to more than 625 U.S. marathons last year. That's up from about 200 in 1985.

For the third consecutive year, the gender division among finishers remained unchanged: 59% men, 41% female. Also unchanged was the percentage of finishers age 40 or older: 46%. Runners between age 20 and 39 made up 52% of finishers, with the under-20 crowd accounting for 2%.

One side effect to this growth is the lower percentage of elite marathoners as more amateurs participate. The median time for male finishers in 2010 was 4:16:14 – compared with 3:32:17 in 1980. Among women, the median time rose to 4:42:10 in 2010 from 4:03:39 in 1980.

Boston boasted the fastest median time among U.S. marathons, at 3:44:17. Boston also had the largest sheer number of under-four-hour finishers, at 15,424. The New York marathon came in second with 14,724. But Boston's under-four-hour crowd represented 68% of the total, versus 33% for New York.

New York's 44,977 finishers represented the largest crowd in the history of the world to complete a 26.2-mile run, ahead of the previous New York record set in 2009, of 43,660.
