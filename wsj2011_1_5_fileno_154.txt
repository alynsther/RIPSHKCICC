Bankrolled by the royal family of Abu Dhabi and a summer spending spree of more than $195 million, Manchester City's expensively assembled squad is joint top of the Premier League standings midway through the season for the first time in almost 40 years.

Whether the club can sustain its title challenge in 2011 will likely rest on a series of tough road trips in the second half of the season. Roberto Mancini's side faces Arsenal on Wednesday and must travel to Manchester United and Chelsea before the campaign is out. 

City is currently available at 7/1 to become English champion for just the third time in its history but a win here would see those odds cut significantly. No team has earned more points on its travels than City's total of 20 this term and the team can be backed at 10/3 to notch another three points here with Victor Chandler.

The Gunners are strong favorites in this game, however, at 20/21 with Boylesports—a price that is doubtless influenced by Arsenal's convincing 3-0 win when these two last met at Eastlands in October.

Arsenal also boasts a strong record in this fixture: The clubs shared a goalless draw in last season's fixture at the Emirates Stadium but the Gunners won each of their four previous Premier League matches at home to City. Indeed, City hasn't won at Arsenal since 1975 during which time it has lost 20 of the 27 games. 

Given that Mr. Mancini is likely to be without two key performers in David Silva, the Spain international, and Italian striker Mario Balotelli, City is unlikely to break that sequence here. Arsène Wenger's side beat Chelsea in its last home game and should be backed for another victory on this occasion.
