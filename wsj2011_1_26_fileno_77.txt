NEW YORK—Blue chips ended with a narrow loss after a late-day rebound ahead of marquee political and economic events—the President's State of the Union address and the results of the Federal Reserve's policy-setting meeting.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 3.33 points, or less than 0.1%, to 11977.19, a day after the average's triple-digit advance pushed it to within striking distance of 12000. The Dow hasn't closed above 12000 since June 19, 2008. At one point, the Dow was down almost 80 points.

The Nasdaq Composite Index overcame early losses to rise 1.7, or 0.1%, to 2719.25. The Standard & Poor's 500 stock index rose 0.34, or less than 0.1%, to 1291.18, the third straight advance. 

Investors traded cautiously as the Federal Reserve's policy committee kicked off a two-day meeting and as they waited for the president's State of the Union address, which is to begin at 9 p.m. Eastern time. The market pared some losses midday following reports that President Obama will call for a five-year freeze on nonsecurity discretionary spending, a move a White House official told The Wall Street Journal was "a down payment toward reducing the deficit," and erased the rest into the close.

A rush of fourth-quarter financial reports from Dow components weighed on the market in what some traders viewed as a natural reaction to mounting expectations.

"It's more a necessary pause from the long run we've had," said  Scott Armiger, portfolio manager at Christiana Bank & Trust, following a mixed batch of earnings reports. While per-share earnings have largely exceeded analysts' expectations, he said, revenue has fallen short more often. "That's a disconnect," he said. "This is as good as it gets unless we can improve sales and that's tough do unless you can grow the economy."

 briefly helped boost the Dow at around 3:18 p.m. Trade data show IBM shares trading at $160.78, before jumping in one trade to $164.35, an increase of $3.57. Because IBM has such a large weighting in the Dow, that move would have accounted for about 27 points of the Dow's advance. Another 7,300 IBM shares traded above $164 and 12,300 at more than $163 before the stock fell back to $160.89, near where it was trading before the jump.

New York Stock Exchange officials said the IBM trades triggered a "liquidity replenishment point," halting electronic trading in the stock and sending trading on the floor into "slow mode." The trades won't not be canceled, said NYSE officials. Shares of IBM ended up 1.81, or 1.1%, at $161.44.

 shed 1.14, or 1.8%, to 61.08. The health-care giant reported a 12% decline in fourth-quarter earnings and issued a forecast for 2011 that fell short of Wall Street expectations, as it grapples with product recalls and a slowdown in health-care markets.

 which rose 55 cents, or 1.6%, to 35.79 despite adding fewer smartphone customers in the fourth quarter and missing analysts' expectations by a penny. The telecommunications operator announced plans to sell the iPhone with a $30 unlimited plan, in line with its standard smartphone plan.

Tuesday's economic data sobered investors who have recently been more optimistic about the global recovery. In the U.S., home prices weakened in November, with the S&P Case-Shiller index of 20 cities falling 1.6% from a year earlier, while a reading of Richmond, Va.-area manufacturing activity rose at a slower pace in January. Still, the Conference Board said its consumer-confidence index for January moved to 60.6, well above the 54.4 expected by economists.

In the U.K., data from the Office for National Statistics showed that the economy unexpectedly contracted for the first time since 2009.

"The underlying theme is that there are problems bubbling below the surface from an economic standpoint and those problems simply can't be ignored from a bounceback in earnings," said  Michael Yoshikami, chief investment strategist at YCMNET Advisors. And as the market has climbed, companies have faced mounting pressure to surpass analysts' earnings expectations in order to impress investors, he said.

Demand for U.S. Treasurys was higher, with yield on the two-year note down slightly and yield on the 10-year note falling to 3.320%.

International investors poured into the first bond issued to fund a new European Union facility to save euro-using governments from default, underscoring confidence in the EU's efforts to safeguard the euro.

The dollar weakened against both the euro and the yen. The euro rose to $1.3682 from $1.3645 late Monday in New York.

Crude-oil prices fell $1.68, or 1.9%, to $86.19 a barrel, while gold fell $12.20, or 0.9% to $1332.30 a troy ounce.
