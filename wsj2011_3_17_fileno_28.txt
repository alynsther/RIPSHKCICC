MUMBAIâ€“Indian shares ended lower Thursday, weighed by a gloomy inflation forecast by the Reserve Bank of India, which also raised policy rates by an expected quarter-percentage point. 

The Bombay Stock Exchange's Sensitive Index fell 208.82 points, or 1.1%, to close at 18,149.87. Thursday's closing level is the Sensex's lowest in March. 

On the National Stock Exchange, the 50-stock S&P CNX Nifty shed 64.50 points, or 1.2%, to end at 5,446.65. 

Trading volume on the BSE decreased to 29.88 billion rupees ($66 million) from Wednesday's 33.81 billion rupees. Gainers lagged decliners 1,201 to 1,638, while 128 stocks were unchanged. 

Earlier in the day, the RBI raised its main lending and borrowing rates by 25 basis points each to 5.75% and 6.75%, respectively, in line with predictions by 14 of 15 economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires. 

The central bank also raised its inflation estimate for end-March to 8%, from 7% previously, and said the underlying inflationary pressures in the economy have accentuated, even as risks to growth are emerging. The higher inflation estimate raised fears of further rate hikes by the central bank, which next meets May 3 for monetary policy review. 

"The rate hike didn't come as a surprise as the RBI has been consistently saying inflation is out of its comfort zone. I continue to be negative on rate-sensitive stocks," said  Vikas Khemani, executive vice president and head of institutional equities at Edelweiss Capital, a Mumbai-based brokerage. 

The Sensex's movement was in line with most other Asian markets. 

Japan's Nikkei pared early losses to end 1.4% down on hopes that the attempts to control the country's nuclear crisis will bear fruit. Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 1.8% while China's Shanghai Composite lost 1.1%.
