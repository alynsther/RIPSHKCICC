MUMBAI â€“ Indian shares closed lower in light trade Monday as investors fretted about the stability of the ruling coalition after a key member withdrew from the federal government over the weekend. 

The weakness in investor sentiment was exacerbated by soaring crude prices amid intensifying tensions in the Middle East and North Africa, which spurred selling in rate-sensitive auto, banking and real estate sectors. 

The Bombay Stock Exchange's Sensitive Index fell 263.78 points, or 1.4%, to close at 18222.67 after moving between 18058.71 and 18361.65. 

On the National Stock Exchange, the 50-stock S&P CNX Nifty slipped 75.60 points, or 1.4%, to end at 5463.15. 

Trading volume on the BSE decreased to 24.33 billion rupees ($542 million) from Friday's 31.58 billion rupees. Gainers lagged decliners 910 to 1,971, while 113 stocks were unchanged. 

The Dravida Munnettra Kazhagam, a regional party from south India, said Saturday it pulled out from the ruling national coalition as it had been unable to come to an agreement with the Congress party for elections in Tamil Nadu state. The move sparks concerns that federal legislation and decision-making could be stymied if the government is unable to find support on certain issues, analysts said. 

"Basically, there are no positive cues," said  Alex Mathews, head of research at Geojit BNP Paribas Financial Services. "There are a lot of uncertainties on the political front and crude prices are high, which is sparking inflation concerns." 

Intensified fighting in Libya over the weekend raised the chance that the country will descend into civil war, and signs of political unrest in several other countries in the region such as Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Yemen, Oman and Algeria sent oil prices higher. 

April Nymex crude oil futures were last trading up 164 cents at $106.06 per barrel in New York. 

"India's equity risk premium tends to move up very sharply during an environment of elevated oil prices,"  Abhay Laijawala, managing director at Deutsche Equities India, said at a seminar. "As long as there are concerns about oil prices moving toward $125-$130 a barrel India will probably continue to under-perform its emerging market peers." 

All but five of the 30 Sensex constituents ended lower Monday. 

Banking shares led declines, with State Bank of India falling 2.9% to 2,622.80 rupees and  HDFC Bank slipping 1.9% to 2,177.35 rupees. 

Among auto stocks, Maruti Suzuki lost 3.7% to 1,264.70 rupees and  Tata Motors closed 3.6% lower at 1,127.25 rupees.

DLF, the only property developer that's part of the Sensex, slid 1.9% to 218.20 rupees. 

"We advise investors to stay away from rate-sensitive shares even though valuations seem attractive, because the head winds continue to blow through these sectors," said Deutsche Equities' Mr. Laijawala. 

Capital goods shares fell on profit-taking following last week's post-budget rally. Bharat Heavy Electricals closed 3.2% lower at 2,018.05 rupees while Larsen & Toubro lost 2.7% to 1,567.55 rupees. 

Among other Sensex losers, Reliance Communications fell 3.5% to 90.05 rupees. 

Gainers included Wipro, which finished 1.0% higher at 446.20 rupees, and Tata Power, up 1.0% at 1,230.35 rupees.
