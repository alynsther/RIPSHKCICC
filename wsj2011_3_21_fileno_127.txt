 LESSONS FOR THE LONG RUN How best to ensure a long life? You're probably familiar with the traditional recipes: Vigorous exercise, married life and a healthy balance of work and play, among other ingredients, help us stay young.

Analyzing data collected from a starting group of 1,500 individuals over the course of 80 years, the authors explain why a host of factors—including "persistence, prudence…and close involvement with friends and communities"—can improve health and longevity.

 A CLASS ON CLASS One of the most important, and least-understood, parts of the health-care overhaul is the Class Act: Community Living Assistance Services and Supports. This program would allow workers age 18 and older to buy insurance from the federal government to help cover the cost of long-term care. The Health and Human Services Department has until October 2012 to set premiums, but Republicans and Democrats alike already are questioning the program's value.

A good way to begin educating yourself about what's certain to be a crucial debate—and one that could have a big impact on your wallet.
