BANGALORE --Piramal Life Sciences Ltd. said its board will meet Friday to consider separating the new chemical research unit of the company and merging it into Piramal Healthcare Ltd.

Piramal Life Sciences listed on the stock exchanges on May 29, 2008, following its separation from Piramal Healthcare.

Piramal Healthcare holds a 17.88% stake in Piramal Life Sciences.

Chairman  Ajay Piramal last year indicated such a possibility when he told a news channel that Piramal Healthcare had a much greater capacity to take on risk, though Piramal Life Sciences' risk exposure has lessened since many of its molecules under development have progressed along the clinical trials path.
