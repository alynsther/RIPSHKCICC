Conventional wisdom says a big reason for the Jets' improved odds to beat the Colts this year in the postseason is the absence of All-Pro tight end Dallas Clark. One minor problem: The man who replaced Mr. Clark after his season-ending injury has been even more productive.

Peyton Manning threw 53 times to Mr. Clark (8.83 passes per game), completing 69.8% for an average gain of 6.55 yards, before the tight end suffered a wrist injury. Enter unknown Jacob Tamme (six career catches). In the 10 games, Mr. Tamme was targeted 93 times (9.3 per game), catching 72% for an average of 6.78 yards.

The Jets this year have defended tight ends well when measured by completion rate (49.5%, in line with their overall, league-best rate of 50.7% completions allowed). But there's enough reason for Jets fans to be concerned about Mr. Tamme Saturday night. In Week 9, they played a Lions team that targeted tight ends a NFL-leading 188 times. Detroit threw 10 times to their tight ends, completing five for 40 yards and a touchdown. Add a 27-yard pass interference and five-yard illegal contact penalties against tight ends to that ledger and it's clear that the Jets coverage struggled in this assignment. The Jets also surrendered tight-end touchdowns this season to Miami, Buffalo, Houston, Pittsburgh and New England.

Expect the Colts to target Mr. Tamme even more than average if the Jets again cover Peyton Manning's favorite target—wide receiver Reggie Wayne—with All Pro cornerback Darrelle Revis. Mr. Wayne finished 2010 second in the NFL with 176 passes thrown his way. Last year when Messrs. Wayne and Revis matched up, Mr. Manning opted for another target 34 times in his 39 attempts.
