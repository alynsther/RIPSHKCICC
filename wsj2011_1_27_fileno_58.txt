Cocktail maven Julie Reiner could never have predicted a winter this miserable when she opened her latest bar, Lani Kai, late last year. 



Well, aloha, she's bringing some Hawaiian sunshine in a glass to SoHo.

The space nods to modern design, not cheesy tiki tropes. A diverse crowd includes in-the-know tipplers, small groups of friends and a lot of women. Keep snug by the fireplace downstairs.

The drinks are fruity, but not frilly or "foofy," Ms. Reiner says. The menu includes tropical touchstones, a Mai Tai and a Pisco Punch, swizzles and punches, boozy and classic New York cocktails, all about $13. It's easiest to slip in with the Hotel California, an apricot-infused gin, pisco, lime and pineapple juice pleaser. 

If you enjoy the Arctic chill, there is the Bermuda Triangle, a "brain freeze" slush with Cachaça, coconut and lychee that is a little like sticking your tongue to frozen metal, but a lot more fun.

 Lani Kai, 525 Broome St. at Thompson in Manhattan, 646-596-8778, is open 5 p.m. to 2 a.m. Monday through Thursday, Fridays until 3 a.m., Saturday from 11 a.m. to 3 a.m. and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 2 a.m.
