Movies can move audiences— and threaten governments—in ways that Americans have either forgotten or haven't known. Late last month an Iranian court sentenced two of Iran's finest filmmakers,  Jafar Panahi and  Mahmoud Rasoulof, to six years in prison, and banned them from making films, writing scripts, traveling abroad or giving interviews for 20 years. The charge was "colluding in gatherings and making propaganda against the regime." By lashing out against these artists, the regime revealed itself to be more fearful and contemptible than its harshest critics might have contended. Fortunately, the offending films can still be seen, not just in the free world but in Iran, where bootleg DVDs circumvent official censorship.

When I reviewed Mr. Panahi's "The Circle" a decade ago, I wrote that "in some parts of the world, making feature films can still be a heroic enterprise." The film (in Farsi with English subtitles, and available, new or used, for purchase through Amazon.com), is a stunning drama about the desperate state of women in Iran. It begins with a blessed event that's immediately blighted by blind prejudice. A newborn baby, certified by ultrasounds to be a boy, turns out to be a girl, which means the in-laws will demand a divorce. That's shocking enough, but it's only a preface to fragmentary portraits of women as they had never been seen before in Iranian cinema.

The director's 2006 comedy, "Offside" also concerns the plight of Iranian women—those who happen to be soccer fans, but who are excluded from the nation's stadiums, even though they may be equal to Iranian men in their passion for the sport. While the film's subversions are delicate, and entertaining, its subjects are perfectly clear: the hypocrisy of discrimination, and the stupidity of authority.
