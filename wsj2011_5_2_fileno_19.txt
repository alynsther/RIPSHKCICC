   Infosys Names New Chairman, CEO  

The company's management was addressing analysts after unveiling a massive reorganization late last week that saw a non-Infosys founder--for the first time--named the chairman of the company and one of the co-founders named new chief executive. 

Infosys Saturday named banking veteran K.V. Kamath as the non executive chairman, replacing chairman and chief mentor  N.R. Narayana Murthy, who retires on Aug. 20. It also named S.D. Shibulal, now chief operating officer, as CEO and elevated Mr. Gopalakrishnan to the position of executive co-chairman. 

As part of the restructuring, the company plans to realign its industry verticals into financial services and insurance; manufacturing; energy and utilities, communications and services and retail, consumer products and logistics, CEO-designate Shibulal said.
