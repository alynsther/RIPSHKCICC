It goes by many names. White lightning. Moonshine. Hooch. 

Call the clear spirit what you will, it's simply whiskey that goes through little to no barrel aging. Yes, it may conjure images of mountain men concocting illegal booze using junkyard auto parts, but many artisanal distilleries have recently elevated the backwoods spirit to something worth sipping as you would a fine brandy. 

"Our white whiskey has a very deliberate approach," says Brian Ellison of Death's Door Distillery. "We utilize a yeast that is better suited for wine. The result plays up a unique note of amyl alcohol found in good grappas, pisco and rhum agricole." 

It's true: There's a distinctive farm-like pureness to these whiskies that puts them closer to an earthy genever (traditional Dutch gin) or cachaça (a rum-like spirit from Brazil) than a bourbon. While traditional whiskey drinkers may still be snobs about the maturity of their Scotch, taste any of our favorites here and we think you'll agree: Age is just a number.
