Mumbai - Goldman Sachs Asset Management India Pvt. Ltd paid nearly 1.3 billion rupees ($28.9 million) to acquire Benchmark Asset Management Co. Pvt Ltd., according to a person involved in the transaction. Benchmark, which currently manages assets worth around $700 million, was advised by Mape Advisory Group Pvt Ltd. 

India "is one of the world's largest growth markets and a strategic priority for our firm,"  Oliver Bolitho, head of Goldman Sachs Asset Management in Asia, said in a release. "The acquisition of Benchmark illustrates our commitment to expand in India and we look forward to working closely with Benchmark to accelerate the growth of the business." 

Goldman Sachs Asset Management intends to bring actively managed on-shore funds to India. Goldman Sachs Mutual Fund entered the Indian asset management space in 2010. 

Benchmark's entire team will be retained by Goldman, while the latter already has eight people based in Mumbai, headed by  Prashant Khemka. The team currently provides research for off-shore funds, including Indian and Bric (Brazil, Russia, India, China) equities. 

Benchmark entered the industry in December 2001 with its maiden Nifty Benchmark Exchange Traded Scheme that currently has assets worth 5.1 billion rupees. In February 2007, Benchmark launched the country's first gold exchange-traded fund (gold ETF). ETFs typically track underlying indices and are traded on exchanges like stocks. Gold ETFs allow investors to hold paper instead of stocks of the metal.
