The rivals had split their two previous meetings this season—with each squad winning on the other's home court. Now it seemed like on neutral ground, neither could pull away.

But Rutgers eventually prevailed, stopping Seton Hall 76-70 in overtime Tuesday in an exhilarating first round of the Big East tournament. The Scarlet Knights advance to face St. John's on Wednesday at 2 p.m.

Seton Hall senior Jeremy Hazell had a game-high 27 points, including a 3-pointer in the final second of regulation that sent the game into overtime. Jonathan Mitchell burrowed repeatedly into the Pirates' defense to lead the Scarlet Knights with 25 points.

Already an analyst for ESPN, a restaurant owner and the director of public safety for Stamford, Conn., former Mets manager Bobby Valentine announced Tuesday the creation of Makuhair Media, a sports-documentary production company. Valentine's partner, Andrew Muscato, produced a 2008 documentary on him called "The Zen of Bobby V." The company's first film, according to Muscato, will focus on two baseball prospects from the Dominican Republic.

Oliver Perez's audition for a spot in the Mets' starting rotation is likely over. The lefty was hit hard in his third spring appearance Tuesday, giving up three runs in three innings in an exhibition game against the Houston Astros. Perez allowed four hits and two walks. Manager Terry Collins and general manager Sandy Alderson made the two-hour drive to Kissimmee, Fla., specifically to watch Perez pitch in the split-squad game. Team officials will meet Wednesday morning to discuss his future with the club.
