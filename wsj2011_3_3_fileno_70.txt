A whiff of danger can really liven up a party. At least this was the case at a Fashion and Fencing event in the glitzy studio of designer  Naeem Khan. Olympic silver  medalist Tim Morehouse was on hand to conduct lessons with 60 members of the Society, a group described as a "culture club for the creative class." Swords weren't the only element of danger: there was also dim lighting, high heels and free rum drinks. 

Mr. Morehouse's ultimate goal is to increase the visibility and popularity of his sport, which he called "a combination of chess and boxing" and also "the best butt workout around." 

After an hour of cocktails, the DJ switched the music from hip hop to classical, and it was time for the fencing champ's clinic to begin. Only about a quarter of those who attended the party chose to suit up, grab a sword and take part in the class, while the rest continued to carouse. 

"Elegant" was an oft-employed buzz word. "I'm not really drawn to fencing," said guest  Justin Mahy, when asked why he'd come. "But it is a very elegant sport and I'm a fan of elegant events." Fashion Week founder  Fern Mallis said that "there's a fashion message" in the sport's elegance. And Mr. Khan used the "E" word many times, adding that "there's a certain serenity to fencing."

And yet, at this depth of winter, with cabin fever at perhaps an all-year high, the student fencers seemed happy to trade elegance in for a rip roaring good time. Mr. Mahy, was overheard yelling, "You're  Luke Skywalker and I'm  Darth Vader!" while jabbing his opponent. 

And in contempt of the guests who'd decided to simply stand by and observe,  Scott Holland said, "Only real men fence. And some women, and those are the kind of women I sleep with." 

For the record, no one was supposed to drink before fencing. Even the invitation said so. A representative from Zacapa Rum said that as "never ever something we would endorse. That's something we're very sensitive about." Still, nobody lost an eye.
