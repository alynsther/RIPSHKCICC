India's IDBI Bank Ltd. has raised 10 billion rupees by selling bonds, two people familiar with the matter said Wednesday.

The state-run lender privately placed 15-year Upper Tier II bonds with a call option at the end of the tenth year, the people, who declined to be named, told Dow Jones Newswires.

The bonds will pay a yield of 9.40% at par, they said, but didn't specify what the money would be used for.
