London auctions will spotlight Chinese and Japanese art next week, from minimalist cool to erotic themes.

Chinese art is one of today's buoyant areas. Japanese art, meanwhile, has lagged, offering opportunities to the knowledgeable collector.

Christie's will hold Asian Art Week with a series of sales from May 10-13, following a series of well-sold New York auctions in March. The London week kicks off Tuesday with a sale of fine Chinese ceramics and other works of art, such as carved antique rhinoceros horn, ivory, metalwork, jade and bronze. Items span the 12th to the 20th century, with estimates ranging from around £1,000 to £800,000.

"The Chinese market has increased steadily in the last 10 years. Today's demand is across-the-board, with ceramics traditionally the strongest part of the market," Christie's Chinese art specialist Pedram Rasti says.

Leading Tuesday's auction will be a rare pair of large blue-and-white vases from the Qianlong period (1736-95) that Mr. Rasti says is "typical of what collectors are looking for. They are very, very nice things." Decorated with large peony blooms, borne on leafy meandering scrolls with smaller blooms, the pair has a powerful presence (estimate: £500,000-£800,000). A further highlight will be a single blue-and-white vase from the same period decorated with striking copper-red flowers that burst with life. It was made for the court of the Qianlong Emperor, an acknowledged porcelain connoisseur (estimate: £350,000-£450,000). Another top lot will be a rare parcel-gilt silver bowl and cover engraved with floral and fruit clusters amid luscious foliage from the Tang Dynasty (618-907). The piece illustrates the fine artistic skill of this early period's craftsmen (estimate: £400,000-£600,000).

On Wednesday, Sotheby's holds its Chinese art sale with around 340 lots. A major highlight will be a small group of ceramics from the Song Dynasty (960-1279). They were assembled over decades by a Japanese collector, who loved the minimalist, monochrome vessels and plates that are one of the high points of artistic achievement in China. This group of 14 works is led by a fascinating vase from the 12th century, the surface of which has a lovely crackle that is like splitting ice. The luminescent surface evokes light shinning through superimposed shards of ice (estimate: £2.5 million-£3 million).

Bonhams 556-lot sale of Chinese art Thursday offers enormous variety in object and period. Two highlights justified separate catalogs devoted exclusively to them. 

One is a rare and beautifully carved, ivory erotic eight-panel album from the 18th century that shows couples enjoying amorous embraces under trees in palace gardens. The leaves are mounted on panels that fold like books, thus ensuring discretion. "The exquisite ivory panels are a superb example of the period's carving at its zenith," says Bonhams Chinese department specialist Asaph Hyman. The panels are expected to fetch £800,000-£1.2 million.

The other is an extraordinary group of archaic Chinese bronze ritual offering vessels that come from a Canadian private collection. Leading them is an elaborate wine vessel decorated with mythical beasts and masks from circa 1300-1050 B.C. that is expected to fetch £700,000-£1 million. 

Turning to Japanese art, Bonhams on Tuesday will offer works from the collection of the late Edward Wrangham. Starting at the age of eight until his death in 2009, Mr. Wrangham assembled notable examples of Japanese inro (little boxes in which Japanese gentlemen secreted valuables on their person), netsuke (miniature figures) and sword fittings. A charming lacquer, three-case, 18th-century inro decorated with an owl wearing a hat is estimated at £3,000-£3,500.

Christie's sale of Japanese art and design Wednesday will include more than 390 lots from the 16th to the 20th century of inro, netsuke, prints, ceramics, sword fittings and lacquer. One standout is a colorful, 17th-century ceramic with an immortal riding a tortoise (estimate: £20,000-£30,000).
