This week may seem a little tame after all the political excitement of last week.

Never fear, there's a lot of action brewing in the corporate world. 

All eyes are turned to see whether a key ministerial panel will be able meet this week to discuss the Cairn-Vedanta deal. Approval of this group is essential for the acquisition to go forward.   Cairn Energy, which wants to sells its India assets to  Vedanta Resources, already has extended the deal deadline to May 20, and really is not keen to do it again. But Finance Minister  Pranab Mukherjee who can convene the meeting of the group of ministers has not done so yet, so Cairn's hand may be forced. 

Also, on Friday, the board of Kavveri Telecom will deliberate about an acquisition in Europe. The telecom manufacturer plans to extend into Europe, West Asia and Africa. 

Previously, the company had indicated that it is in talks with private equity investors to raise nearly $9 million by selling a stake in its infrastructure unit. A decision on that may also be announced. 

The second Africa-India summit will commence in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on Friday and will run until May 25. African countries are keen to have Indian companies invest there and help expand their businesses.
