 Austin, Texas 

New York chef Paul Liebrandt was savoring his first visit to the annual South by Southwest film festival on Sunday. Long a star on the Big Apple's restaurant scene, the man behind the visionary cuisine of TriBeCa's Corton is now a star on the screen as well. "A Matter of Taste," the new documentary by New York-based filmmaker Sally Rowe, made its world premiere here on Sunday—tracking a decade of the chef's struggle to reach the top of his profession.

Mr. Liebrandt said he didn't mind a camera in the kitchen all those years. "She's a friend," he said, chatting with moviegoers at a post-premiere reception. "I just get on with my life and do my thing. After the first five years it kind of warmed up." He smiled to show he wasn't entirely serious. He wasn't kidding about a planned barbecue jaunt to Smitty's, the legendary spot outside of Austin. "I'm really looking forward to this. Good food is good food."
