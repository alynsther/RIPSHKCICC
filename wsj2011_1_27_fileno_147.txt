If the Green Bay Packers win Super Bowl XLV, we're not sure what else there would be for Charles Woodson to do in football. Win a fantasy-football title, perhaps.

Mr. Woodson, the Green Bay Packers cornerback, is on the brink of an unusual personal trifecta. He's won the Heisman Trophy and a major-college national championship at Michigan, and if the Packers defeat the Pittsburgh Steelers in the upcoming Super Bowl, he'll become either the third or the fourth NFL player to have done all three, depending on one's view of Reggie Bush.

Mr. Bush completed the sweep last year, but the former Southern California star later returned his 2005 Heisman amid an impermissible-benefits scandal. Before him, Hall of Fame running backs Tony Dorsett (Univ. of Pittsburgh; Dallas Cowboys) and Marcus Allen (USC; Los Angeles Raiders) achieved all three.

Across the four major American team sports, winning the college most-valuable-player award and a college and pro title is a rare feat. No baseball player has done it, largely because college's Golden Spikes Award dates only to 1978 and because many of baseball's top players bypass college. Outfielder Mark Kotsay won the 1995 Golden Spikes, led Cal State Fullerton to that year's title and was a rookie on the eventual-champion 1997 Florida Marlins, but only played in a handful of midseason games.
