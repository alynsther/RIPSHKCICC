If New York drivers who like to cruise the streets in their SUVs are wondering what happened to the serious cyclists on Sunday, no, they haven't been rounded up by the cops once and for all. 

Thousands of them took off by their own free will early in the morning to take part in the inaugural Gran Fondo New York, a large, competitive group ride that exited Manhattan over the George Washington Bridge and wound up the backroads of New York and New Jersey for 100 miles. 

Unlike last weekend's Five Boro Bike Ride, this one was meant to be fast, with some professional cyclists taking part in the action, including George Hincapie, a former Lance Armstrong teammate. 

Though it was not a race, the riders were timed up some of the steepest climbs for a chance to qualify for an amateur world championship event in Europe later this summer. 

Gran Fondos originated in Italy, where bike riding is considered a more mainstream form of transportation. 

Tens of thousands of people participate in the Gran Fondos in Europe and high level professionals compete in earnest for top placings. The races are beginning to pop up in the U.S. as the sport becomes more popular. 

More U.S. Gran Fondos are being planned, and a company called Echelon Gran Fondo is in the planning stages for a Gran Fondo next summer that will include New York City and parts of Connecticut.
