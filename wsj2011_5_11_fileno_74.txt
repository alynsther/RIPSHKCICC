Reed Krakoff often refers to himself as the "oldest young designer ever." He launched his eponymous line in 2010 at the age of 45 after generating vast quantities of wealth at the helm of "affordable luxury" accessories brand Coach Inc. 

On Monday at Pier 60, Mr. Krakoff was honored by his alma mater, Parsons the New School for Design, at a benefit that raised $1.5 million. In attendance was Mr. Krakoff's mother, Sandra, who in a recent New Yorker profile contradicted pretty much everything her son said. (Mr. Krakoff said his mother "thought it was very funny.") 

In a speech, Mr. Krakoff recalled that when he first told his parents that he wanted to study fashion design at Parsons, his mother said, "but nobody makes any money in that business." Mr. Krakoff earned $21 million last year, according to Coach's most recent proxy statement.

As always, the Parsons event, which was live-streamed globally for the first time, featured a student fashion show. One of the students showed well-constructed designs in muted colors with a decidedly minimalist bent. "That's my intern," said designer and Parsons alum  Narciso Rodriguez, who is known for his sexy minimalist look and impeccable garment construction. 

Mr. Rodriguez also seemed an appropriate person to weigh in on Kate Middleton's Alexander McQueen wedding gown. Mr. Rodriguez designed the dress for  Carolyn Bessette Kennedy in 1996 for the closest thing to a royal wedding America has ever seen. 

"I thought [Ms. Middleton, now the Duchess of Cambridge] looked absolutely beautiful and I was very happy she wore McQueen," said Mr. Rodriguez, who was wearing a suit by Band of Outsiders, an emergency pre-Oscars purchase at Barneys in Los Angeles, paired with New Balance sneakers. "My feet hurt," he said. "All I do is run around my office."
