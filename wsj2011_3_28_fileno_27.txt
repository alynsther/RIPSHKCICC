CANBERRAâ€”Australia's parliament has agreed on legislation that sets out the regulatory framework for the National Broadband Network, Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy Stephen Conroy said Monday. 

The legislation passed the House of Representatives on Monday, and included some amendments accepted by the Senate on Friday. 

"The bills set out a clear regulatory framework to provide that NBN Co. will operate on a wholesale-only, open and equivalent-access basis, delivering long-term benefits for competition and consumers," he said in a statement. 

Passage of the bills further underpins the government's policy to deliver structural reform of the telecommunications industry to promote sustainable retail-level competition, and fair pricing of wholesale services for all Australians, he said. 

The amendments will also support state-owned NBN in its delivery of a uniform national wholesale pricing, which the government expects will translate into affordable and competitive retail prices for high-speed broadband services, he said. 

  Telstra Corp., Australia's largest telecommunications provider, said March 17 that negotiations with state-owned NBN over its part in the development of a 36 billion Australian dollar (US$36.9 billion) national broadband network continue to progress, but that it will have to delay a shareholder vote on the deal. 

Telstra is negotiating to lease its existing infrastructure to NBN. Under the changes, Telstra would progressively shut down its copper network and move its customers to the broadband company.
