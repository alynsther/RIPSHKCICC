UDAIPUR, India -- Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. said Thursday it will raise vehicle prices next week to offset higher input costs.

India's biggest car maker by sales has already raised prices twice in the financial year through March, as it tries to protect its margins that have been hit by an increase in prices of key raw materials such as steel and aluminum. The strengthening in the value of the yen against the U.S. dollar has further put pressure on the local unit of Japan's  Suzuki Motor Corp.

 by making imported parts costlier for the auto maker as well as its vendors.

Still, rising competition in India's automobile market has prevented the company from raising car prices to an extent to fully set-off higher costs.

"We will have to raise it [prices] now,"  Mayank Pareek, Maruti's managing executive officer for sales and marketing, told reporters.

He declined to disclose the size of the possible increase in prices.

Maruti said also that  Nissan Motor Co. will source fewer A-Star small cars this financial year because of a slowdown in the European market.

Nissan will likely source 20,000 A-Star cars this year, compared with 51,072 cars in the previous financial year,  Shashank Srivastava, Maruti's chief general manager for marketing, said separately.

"Nissan offtake this year will be low as European market for small cars is yet to revive," Mr. Srivastava said.

He said also that Maruti will increase production of the Alto small car to 40,000 units a month from 32,000 currently.

"We have asked vendors to ramp up supplies for the Alto as we envisage a significant jump in volumes," Mr. Srivastava said.
