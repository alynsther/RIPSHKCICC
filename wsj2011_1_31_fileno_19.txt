BEIJING—China Development Bank Corp. said it hasn't participated in bidding for German bank WestLB AG.

People familiar with the situation have said in recent days that state-owned China Development Bank is one of four final parties eyeing a major stake in WestLB. The other bidders are U.S. leveraged-buyout firms Blackstone Group LP, Apollo Management LP and J.C. Flowers & Co., the people said.

China Development Bank "has not participated in this bidding," an official in the Chinese bank's news office said Monday regarding WestLB. The official declined to comment further.

It isn't clear what exactly the statement might mean for China Development Bank's possible role in any WestLB deal. The statement didn't rule out making a bid for WestLB in the future. Nonbinding bids, which could be in the neighborhood of €10 billion ($13.6 billion), aren't due until Feb. 11.

Investment bankers who work with Chinese financial institutions say Chinese banks like China Development Bank, wary of provoking political controversy, could seek minority stakes in European lenders rather than acquiring them outright.
