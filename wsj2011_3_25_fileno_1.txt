  A California utility has agreed to pay up to $6 million to the state after regulators accused it of failing to provide all required safety records for its network of natural-gas pipelines. 

The agreement is the latest development following the explosion last fall of a  PG&E Corp.

 pipeline in San Bruno, Calif. that killed eight people and destroyed 38 houses. 

Investigators of the blast identified defects in the San Bruno pipe, which dated to the 1950s, that were not properly described in company records.

PG&E also agreed to do safety tests on pipelines that run through populated areas if records are missing, and to replace them if necessary, a spokesman said late Thursday. And it will continue to search for records to verify that all pipelines are being operated at safe pressures.

The California Public Utilities Commission said it would suspend $3 million of the fine if PG&E met all deadlines and finishes the work by August 31. The fines were to be paid with corporate money and will not be passed on to ratepayers, according to the agreement.

The commission's board, which must ratify the agreement, is expected to review it March 28.

After the San Bruno disaster, regulators ordered PG&E to furnish records on all of its pipelines in populated areas.

But in a report submitted last week, PG&E disclosed that it had no records of pressure tests, which measure the soundness of pipelines, for about 150 miles of pipe similar to the San Bruno line. 

The company also had found pressure-test records on just two-thirds of 1,800 miles of pipe that run through populated areas.

"We made a good-faith effort to fully comply with the commission's directive," said PG&E spokesman  Joe Molica, who added that the current state of the company's records was "absolutely unacceptable to us."
