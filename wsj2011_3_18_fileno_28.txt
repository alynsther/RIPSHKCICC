BANGALORE – The India unit of the U.K.'s Vodafone Group PLC has so far gained the maximum number of subscribers on a net basis, since the launch of mobile number portability on Jan. 20, the telecom operator's association said Friday. 

Vodafone Essar Ltd. gained 192,761 users, while Idea Cellular Ltd. and sector leader Bharti Airtel Ltd. added 150,789 and 148,215 subscribers, respectively, Cellular Operators Association of India said in a statement. 

Mobile number portability lets cell phone users change their service provider while retaining their number. 

The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India earlier this month said about 3.83 million users asked to change their mobile services operator at the end of February, compared with 1.71 million users as of Feb. 5., the first time data was made available by the regulator.

The second-largest mobile phone operator by users, Reliance Communications Ltd., which offers services both on GSM and code division multiple access technology platforms, lost 306,417 users in the same period, the telecom operator's association added.
