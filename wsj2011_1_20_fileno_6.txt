 Read excerpts from The Journal's interview with the Ivory Coast's internationally recognized president, Alassane Ouattara., at the Golf Hotel, in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, Thursday, Jan. 20, 2011. 

"Mediation has not yielded the results we had hoped. Mr. Gbagbo continues to want to be the man in power even though he was not elected. It's clear that this cannot be allowed."

"The position of [West African regional bloc] Ecowas now should be using other measures, including legitimate force. Clearly military intervention now is necessary, to remove Mr. Gbagbo. I talk to President Jonathan [of Nigeria] two times to a week, and he has given me assurances that we're still on course [for military intervention]. If Mr. Gbagbo does not want to leave, military intervention has been used elsewhere in Africa and Latin America, so why not Cote d'Ivoire?"

"Financial and economic sanctions certainly take time, but they have their effect. For myself I have not been in favor of economic sanctions, because it has an impact on the population, but maybe we have to do [broader sanctions] for a short period to make it clear that Mr. Gbagbo is the problem, and he is the cause of the problems for the Ivorian people…If financial sanctions don't bite we should move on to economic and trade sanctions. That includes cocoa exports."

"The Presidential Palace is a symbol of power, which I don't have, but I don't think Mr. Gbagbo will stay there for very long. I have composed a government of just 13 members, instead of the 30 I would like to have. This is the major handicap of being in the hotel. But our plan is not to stay here very long. We've been here too long already, six weeks…For the meantime we have not envisaged that [leaving to stay elsewhere outside the hotel]…."

"I am in contact with the companies, my ministers are in contact with them. It's very difficult for them. Many of the executives have left and their Ivorian managers are handling things…The majority of the companies are not paying taxes…The amount Gbagbo has been getting from the central bank accounts suggests he is not getting the full amount of resources that would come normally."

* * *

"Diplomatically Mr. Gbagbo is isolated…Financially it's tightening. Military moves are being organized…."

* * *

"In terms of paying our hotel bills? We have asked countries and organizations to help us with that. Many countries in Europe and elsewhere have agreed. We have requested help from America and we're waiting for their reply."

* * *

"If Gbagbo cuts off water and light access at the hotel, they will have a problem with everyone. They already have gross human rights violations on their back, and if they did that it would be one action too much. They might not be suicidal to that point yet…"

"I don't think mediation should be on the agenda [anymore]."
