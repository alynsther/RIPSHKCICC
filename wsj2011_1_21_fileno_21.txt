SHANGHAI—China more than tripled its uranium imports last year to feed new nuclear reactors and to raise stocks of the fuel for its aggressive civil nuclear expansion program. 

Beijing aims to raise nuclear power's contribution to 5% of total generating capacity by 2020, from less than 2% now, as it is cleaner-burning than coal and oil, despite the problem of permanently storing the deadly waste. 

The country imported 2,999 metric tons of uranium in December, more than 10 times as much as a year earlier, final monthly data released by the General Administration of Customs showed Friday. 

Last month's imports brought the year's total to 17,136 tons. China shipped the raw material feedstock for nuclear power plants from Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Namibia, Russia and Australia in 2010. 

The country brought online two reactors last year, bringing its total annual nuclear power generating capacity to 10.8 gigawatts. 

Beijing plans to build dozens more reactors by 2020 in order to reach a target of deriving 15% of its energy mix from non-fossil fuels by the end of the decade, which may lead to uranium shortages, as its domestic output is limited. 

Leading state-owned nuclear power developers China National Nuclear Corp. and China Guangdong Nuclear Power Holdings Corp. continued to lock in long-term uranium contracts last year to safeguard future supplies. 

China Guangdong Nuclear signed a uranium trade contract with Uzbekistan's Navoi Mining & Metallurgy Combine in June, and an agreement with Canada's  Cameco Corp. in November for the supply of 29 million pounds of uranium concentrate through 2025. 

China National Nuclear signed an agreement in June with Cameco involving approximately 23 million pounds of uranium concentrate supplies through 2020.
