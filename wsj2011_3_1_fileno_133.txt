  Warren Buffett has loaded his "elephant gun" and says he is "itchy" to make some big-game acquisitions. 

Time to go on safari. As outlined in his just-released 2010 shareholder letter, Mr. Buffett has some exacting target criteria: big, industrial businesses with near-monopoly positions and solid sales growth; at least $75 million in pretax income; market values of about $5 billion to $20 billion.

The beauty of  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is that it needn't play by the same rules as other corporate acquirers: The running "float" of some $66 billion from insurance businesses gives Mr. Buffett access to lower-cost capital, all at massive scale. And he can leverage his personal cachet into financial value. So many boards and owners want to sell their businesses to Berkshire that Mr. Buffett won't participate in auctions. That helps keep prices down. The Warren Buffett acquisition model is built on exploiting Buffett-ness itself.

That in mind, the following are acquisition suggestions, based in part on reporting about Mr. Buffett's actual interests as well as screening for the criteria laid out in his shareholder letter. These include excellent, but not overheated, benchmarks: return on equity of between 10% and 30% and estimated future earnings-per-share growth of between 7% and 20% as screened via CapitalIQ. 

•  Illinois Tool Works Inc.
ITW

 (market cap: $26.8 billion; 17% return on equity; 18% margins on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda): This company has long caught Mr. Buffett's fancy, according to a person familiar with his interest, and a potential deal was bandied about a few years ago. If a bit large, it still fits Mr. Buffett's criteria to a T, housing businesses from furniture lamination to arc-welding equipment that should expand in a secular economic upturn. If the mix of businesses seems too diverse, don't forget that Berkshire purchased the Pritzker family's industrial holding company, Marmon Holdings Inc., for $4.5 billion at the start of 2008. 

• Automatic Data Processing Inc. (market cap: $24.8 billion; gross margins, 51%; high-trading Ebitda multiple of 11.25 times): A high-margin service business with deep customer base, high customer switching costs, no inventory worries and no debt. Rumors have abounded recently about a Berkshire-ADP deal. One of the benefits of folding such a business under Berkshire is that all the margin information, so useful to competitors, stays hidden from public view.

•  Kennametal Inc.
KMT


-1.91
%




 ($3.2 billion market cap; 36% gross margins; negative revenue growth since 2006): In his latest shareholder letter, Mr. Buffett couldn't stop crowing about his purchase of Israel's Iscar Cutting Tools, where he says sales are expected to soon cross prerecession levels. Iscar bought a business similar to Kennametal in 2008, spending $1 billion on a company named Tungaloy Corp. Kennametal still is trading below its prerecession highs, but its multiple remains nearly 10 times Ebitda, typically higher than the usual Buffett multiple range, in the mid to high single digits. A spokeswoman says "there have been no discussions with Berkshire Hathaway."

• Expeditors International of Washington Inc. ($10.1 billion market cap; no debt; average five-year return on equity: 21.3%): A quiet but critical West Coast cog in the global shipping and logistics business, Expeditors International boasts decent margins, zero debt and a chief executive,  Peter Rose, in place since 1988. Expeditors would be a complementary fit for Burlington Northern, moving goods from ships to railcars, as the procession of global trade between North America and Asia continues an inevitable rise. If "culture counts," as Mr. Buffett says, then Expeditors fits just fine. It eschews earnings calls and instead answers investor questions in periodic securities filings.

• Schindler Holding Corp. ($12.5 billion market cap; 26.6% return on equity; no debt): The Swiss elevator and escalator company is a bet on urbanization in China, India and the rest of Asia. With excellent brand recognition and a 137-year history, this would be a true gem of the Berkshire portfolio. The key to any purchase, however, would be persuading the presiding Schindler family to do a deal. Its chief executive,  Alfred N. Schindler, has been CEO since 1985, and now might be a good time to make a transition. Mr. Buffett can promise plenty of autonomy to nervous family members. 

•  W.W. Grainger Inc.
GWW


-0.81
%




 ($9.2 billion market cap; valued at 9.2 times Ebitda; 14.1% Ebitda margins): Interestingly, both the stock screen and bankers homed in on Chicago industrial-distribution company Grainger, with an enviable roster of 1.8 million customers in 153 countries. Best known for its namesake catalog, Grainger shares have increased by some 30% over the past year, not ideal conditions for a takeover bid. But a Berkshire bid might be a nice swan song for 7% shareholder and former CEO  David W. Grainger, 82 years old, whose father founded the company.
