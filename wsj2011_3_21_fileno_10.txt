BERLIN—German authorities won the extradition of suspected Nazi death-camp guard  John Demjanjuk from the U.S. two years ago, promising an orderly trial and swift justice. 

With closing arguments in Munich's regional court set to commence this week, it's clear they have achieved neither. The proceedings, now in their 15th month, have been bogged down by disputes over the authenticity of key pieces of evidence, the 90-year-old defendant's failing health and a torrent of defense motions. 

The trial, likely one of the last of its kind, was supposed to signal Germany's enduring commitment to facing its past and pursuing justice for Holocaust victims. Instead, the country risks a public debacle.

"It's turning into exactly what the defense wanted," says  Thomas Henne, a legal historian at the University of Frankfurt. The problem, he says, is that it's all but impossible to obtain concrete evidence or reliable witness testimony 70 years after the alleged crimes took place. 

The judge originally hoped to reach a verdict this week, but a recent barrage of defense motions means there might not be a decision until May.  Cornelius Nestler, who represents families of Holocaust victims who are co-plaintiffs, accuses the defense of deliberately trying to stall the trial by filing frivolous motions. Mr. Demjanjuk's laywer,  Ulrich Busch, says the motions—the judge recently rejected 350 of them—are simply part of his strategy to prove his client's innocence. 

Mr. Demjanjuk, a native of the Ukraine who emigrated to the U.S. after the war, has faced scrutiny for alleged war-time crimes for decades. He was stripped of his U.S. citizenship in 1981 and deported to Israel where he was sentenced to death in 1988 for being "Ivan the Terrible," a guard at the Treblinka death camp in Poland. He was freed five years later after evidence emerged that he wasn't Ivan the Terrible. 

Following his acquittal, Mr. Demjanjuk returned to the U.S. and his citizenship was reinstated. A U.S. District Court in Cleveland revoked his citizenship again in 2002, however, based on the evidence currently being debated in the German court. Prosecutors no longer accuse Mr. Demjanjuk of being Ivan the Terrible, but believe he was a guard at another death camp in Poland, Sobibor. 

Mr. Demjanjuk has been charged with 28,060 counts of accessory to murder. He has maintained his innocence throughout and sees political motives in Germany's pursuit of him. 

"The nation which murdered with merciless cruelty millions of innocent people, attempts to extinguish...my life with a political show trial seeking to blame me, a Ukrainian peasant, for crimes committed by Germans," he wrote in a statement last week.

Prosecutors describe the defendant as a cold-blooded, SS-trained guard who willingly herded thousands of Jews into gas chambers. 

Mr. Demjanjuk's lawyer insists he was in a prisoner-of-war camp throughout the war, a claim Mr. Nestler, the victims' lawyer, calls "his lifelong lie."

Prosecutors have had difficulties producing concrete evidence against Mr. Demjanjuk, relying on historical evidence, damaged documents and testimony from witnesses who have since died or are elderly.

Saying only three letters were readable, a court-appointed handwriting expert refused to authenticate Mr. Demjanjuk's alleged Sobibor identity card—a key piece of prosecution evidence the defense maintains is forged. 

Mr. Nestler and other lawyers produced two sworn statements by a now deceased Sobibor guard from 1949 and 1979 alleging he worked with the defendant. But Mr. Busch produced a another statement from the same witness mentioning other fellow guards but not Mr. Demjanjuk. 

Mr. Demjanjuk insists he never worked in a Nazi death camp. Even if the court determines that Mr. Demjanjuk is lying, a prisoner of war can claim exemption from war crimes, under German law, if he can prove he committed the crime out of fear for his life. 

Critics say German prosecutors are unfairly pursing a geriatric defendant to compensate for Germany's decision to let many perpetrators escape punishment in the immediate aftermath of the war. After the war, many men escaped trial by saying they were too elderly or low-ranking, a mistake "a whole generation of young prosecutors" now regrets, says Mr. Henne, the historian. 

For Mr. Nestler, however, prosecution comes better late than never.

"Should Germany stay away from prosecuting a murderer because of stupid mistakes of lawyers in the past?" he asks. "The answer is ano.'"
