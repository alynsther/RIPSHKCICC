Defenseman Mike Weaver's first goal in 42 games, scored off the back of Rangers forward Artem Anisimov, broke a third-period tie and lifted the Florida Panthers to a victory over New York on Tuesday night.

Mr. Weaver flipped a shot from the right side that hit Mr. Anisimov in front and bounded past surprised goalie Henrik Lundqvist with 8:19 remaining. 

Mr. Anisimov was victimized twice as Rostislav Olesz's first-period goal also caromed off him and past Mr. Lundqvist. Derek Stepan, Brian Boyle and Brandon Prust scored for the Rangers.
