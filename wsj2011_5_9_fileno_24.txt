LONDONâ€”The world's largest economies are set to grow at different speeds, with the U.S., Germany and Russia performing strongly, while Italy, Brazil and India will experience slower growth than they are used to, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's composite leading indicator. 

The Paris-based think tank Monday said its leading indicator of economic activity in its 34 members rose to 103.2 in March from 103 in February, signalling that growth among developed economies as a whole will pick up. But it said some developed and developing economies will lag, experiencing growth that is below the long-term trend. 

"Composite leading indicators ... are pointing to some divergence in the pace of economic activity across major economies," the OECD said. "The CLIs for Italy, Brazil and India are pointing to slowdowns in economic activity relative to trend." 

The OECD said that given recent events in Japan, it was impossible to calculate a CLI for that country. The organization said that the CLIs for the U.K. and France suggest growth will be "slow, albeit stable," while those for Canada and China "signal regained momentum." 

The OECD's leading indicators are designed to provide early signals of turning points between the expansion and slowdown of economic activity. They are based on a wide variety of data series that have a history of signaling changes in economic activity. 

The leading indicator for the U.S. rose to 103.4 from 103.2 in February, while Germany's rose to 105 from 104.9 and Russia's rose to 105 from 104.9. 

Italy's leading indicator fell to 101.5 from 102, Brazil's fell to 98.4 from 99 and India's fell to 99.4 from 99.7.
