On Thursday, at Cipriani Wall Street at the Operation Smile gala,  Santo Versace, older brother of Gianni and Donatella and the president and co-chief executive officer of Gianni Versace SpA, will receive the  John Connor Humanitarian Award for his contributions to the organization. Operation Smile supports the need for quality cleft care around the world. 

In 2007, Mr. Versace became chairman of the Operation Smile board in Italy, which has raised more than $1.8 million in the past year. In his hotel suite this week, Mr. Versace said, through a translator, that he was involved with the organization "to give back hope to children who have no hope. That's fundamental. In 45 minutes, you can give back life to children who are seen as castaways. This is an illness that can be treated and right way. Bureaucracies are not helping." 

"My father always said to me, 'One day without a smile is no day,' and I feel that that's my legacy," added Mr. Versace, who is also involved in Italian government. As for the relationship between fashion and philanthropy, he said that "creative people are very sensitive. They're focused on their work, but also on charity."

While in New York, he plans to visit with his son, a student at Columbia, check up on the Versace boutique on Madison as well as local department stores. Not much time for fun, he explained. "I'm used to working seven days a week," he said. "I learned that from my mother and father, too, and I haven't lost the habit."
