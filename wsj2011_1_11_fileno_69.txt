SHANGHAI—The eastern Chinese city of Wenzhou, in a pilot program, will let residents invest directly overseas, a small liberalization step that is part of a wider effort by China to reduce controls on its currency that could take some pressure off the yuan to rise. 

Wenzhou residents will be allowed to invest up to $200 million a year, though investment in a single project can't exceed $3 million, according to a statement posted on the website of the Wenzhou Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Bureau.

Residents aren't allowed to invest in overseas property or equities markets under the trial, the bureau added. 

Though smaller and less well-known than nearby Shanghai, Wenzhou is among China's wealthiest cities. Many of its entrepreneurs have made fortunes in manufacturing, trading and real estate, and $200 million is by no means an unreachable number for some of the most prosperous. Tycoons from the city have already found ways to invest their cash in the far corners of the world, from textiles in Italy to trucking ventures in Africa.

Since the new measure is focused on one city—albeit a prosperous one—its larger impact is likely to be limited. 

However, China has a history of liberalizing its economy through small and careful steps, what is called "crossing the river by feeling the stones." Authorities launch an experiment, pause to examine the impact, and iron out any problems and then, if successful, the experiment is broadened. That was how free-market capitalism spread through China from Special Economic Zones along the coast. In the same way it is possible that Wenzhou is being used as a laboratory for exploring the consequences of allowing a much broader liberalization of offshore investment.
