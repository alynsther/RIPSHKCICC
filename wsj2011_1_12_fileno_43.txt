Asian markets ended on a positive note Wednesday as resource sector shares and financials got a lift from a higher finish on Wall Street and an overnight jump in commodity prices.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 1.5% to 24125.61, China's Shanghai Composite added 0.6% to 2821.31 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 and South Korea's Kospi each advanced 0.3% to 4724.21 and 2094.95, respectively.

Indian shares snapped a six-day losing streak, with the Sensex rising 1.8% to close at 19534.10. Banking shares led the gains. ICICI Bank climbed 4.5% and HDFC Bank added 2.8%. 

Despite the regionwide advance, sentiment remained cautious ahead of European sovereign bond auctions this week. Portugal is due to auction 2014 and 2020 bonds on Wednesday, Spain is auctioning 2016 bonds Thursday and Italy is due to auction 2026 government bonds on the same day.

"Tensions concerning European conditions will continue through the week," said  Kenichi Hirano, operating officer at Tachibana Securities.

Japan's Nikkei Stock Average ended little changed, up 0.02% to 10512.80.

Gains in Australian shares were capped by concerns over the impact of massive flooding in the state of Queensland.

"Everyone's waiting to see just how much damage occurs in Brisbane," said RBS Morgans investment adviser  Chris MacDonald. "It's too early to make any assumptions on how the government will respond, but I think an infrastructure bond would be a good idea."
