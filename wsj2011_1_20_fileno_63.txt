Hollywood insiders are buzzing about the fact that Nicole Kidman isn't featured in trailers for the new Adam Sandler/Jennifer Aniston vehicle, "Just Go With It," which hits movie theaters in mid-February. 

In the film, Mr. Sandler plays a plastic surgeon who asks his office manager (Ms. Aniston) to pose as his wife so he can continue a charade to land a character played by Brooklyn Decker. Ms. Kidman stars in a supporting role, as Ms. Aniston's college sorority sister.

Ms. Kidman was interviewed by Ms. Aniston in support of the movie for the February cover of Harper's Bazaar. A still from the film showed them dressed as hula dancers in Hawaii. In a recent online interview, Mr. Sandler called a hula scene the actresses performed for the film "an awesome sight." (Separately, Ms. Kidman also appears on the cover of this week's People magazine in a story about her new surrogate-born daughter, Faith Margaret.) 

Trailers, like films, are subject to countless edits, research tests and focus groups, so many factors could be related to Ms. Kidman's absence. One behind-the-scenes observer privy to studio research suggested that the women who like Mr. Sandler's films do not also respond to Ms. Kidman. 

On another note, Ms. Kidman's films don't do nearly as well at the box office as Ms. Aniston's. Ms. Kidman's last five pictures—"Margot at the Wedding," "The Golden Compass," "Australia," "Nine" and "Rabbit Hole," which is still in theaters—grossed about $142 million domestically. Ms. Aniston's—"The Switch," "The Bounty Hunter," "Love Happens," "He's Just Not That Into You" and "Marley & Me"—grossed about $355 million.

A spokesman for Sony Pictures, however, which is releasing "Just Go With It," said Ms. Kidman's role is a "fun, smaller one" and "a true treat of the movie we are trying to keep a surprise."
