WASHINGTON--The White House on Friday eased travel restrictions to Cuba and expanded payments to the country as part of an effort to allow U.S. citizens and institutions to engage directly with Cuba. 

President Barack Obama has ordered changes in U.S. policy that would allow religious groups to travel to the country and increase journalistic activities on the island. Other changes include the ability for U.S. citizens to send as much as $2,000 per year in remittances to non-family members in order to support private economic activity. 

The new measures also allow educational institutions to sponsor travel to the island.

These "are important steps in reaching the widely shared goal of a Cuba that respects the basic rights of all its citizens," the White House said in a press release. The directives build on earlier moves by the Obama administration designed to increase the flow of people and goods between the U.S. and Cuba. 

The measures announced Friday also allow all U.S. international airports to apply to provide services to licensed charters flying to Cuba.

The policies comes after the island's aging dictator, Fidel Castro, transferred power to his brother,  Raul Castro.
