Currently on display at the Carolina Nitsch Gallery in Chelsea are several new sculptures by the artist Richard Dupont. They are oversize busts constructed out of archival polyurethane resin and modeled after Mr. Dupont's own head. Inside are pieces of garbage the artist and his family have produced the past few years, including miniature Care Bears, beer cans, an old battery pack and outgrown shoes. 

"My kids' artwork is in there," said the artist's wife, Lauren, who was joined at the opening late last week by pals Aerin Lauder, Hamilton South and literary agent Luke Janklow. "He starting collecting our trash and I thought he was crazy. But the pieces have turned out beautifully. I told him I wanted one for Mother's Day."

Mr. Dupont said that his studio had been filled with eight years of molds "from making stuff and having false starts. When you're a sculptor there is just so much material." 

After dumping much of it in a barn in Connecticut, he had the idea to create "these reliqueries or memory banks made of everything we consumed, used or processed." He organized 3,000 pounds of trash into piles to make these sculptures, which each have different themes and titles. (There are also a few additional resin works that simulate trash bags.) It would have been nice (not to mention time-consuming), Mr. Dupont added, to catalog each piece of detritus in the heads. "But they all have their own story."
