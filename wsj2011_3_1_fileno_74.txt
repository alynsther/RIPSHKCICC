Even with a cast on his hand, Greg McElroy managed to make noise at the NFL combine. The Alabama quarterback, who broke a bone in his hand at the Senior Bowl, scored 48 out of 50 on the Wonderlic intelligence test, two people familiar with the situation said. (The average quarterback's score is said to be 24.) McElroy got his undergrad degree in three years and earned a master's with a 4.0 GPA. Only one player in NFL history has aced the Wonderlic: former Harvard and Bengals punter Pat McInally.

The Knicks lost on Friday to the Cavaliers and their .175 winning percentage, then two days later New York beat LeBron James's Miami Heat and their .729 mark. Not only must that have put a smile on the face of Clevelanders, it was a rare feat. Since 2000-01, only three teams at least 40 games into the season faced a wider winning percentage in consecutive games and lost first to the inferior team then beat the better one.
