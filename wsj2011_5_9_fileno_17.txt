MUMBAI â€“ Indian shares ended flat Monday as a sharp rebound in Hindustan Unilever following its strong quarterly earnings performance helped offset weakness in auto stocks after local car sales grew at the slowest pace in nearly two years in April. 

The Bombay Stock Exchange's Sensitive Index closed up 10.15 points, or 0.1%, at 18528.96 after moving between 18367.21 and 18643.58. On the National Stock Exchange, the 50-stock S&P CNX Nifty fell 0.35 points, or 0.01%, to end at 5551.10. 

Trading volume on the BSE fell to 23.05 billion rupees ($515 million) from Friday's 33.89 billion rupees. Gainers lagged decliners 1,284 to 1,512, while 109 stocks were unchanged. 

"People are uncertain about the direction of the market because commodity prices have eased off over the past two sessions, but concerns about the impact of the central bank's monetary tightening remain," said K.N. Rahaman, deputy head of research at Way2Wealth Securities. 

He expects the benchmark to remain range-bound in coming sessions with investors taking profits in large-capitalization shares on rallies. 

Of the 30 Sensex constituents, 18 ended lower Monday. 

Hindustan Unilever, India's largest consumer goods maker by sales, rose 3.6% to 284.45 rupees after exceeding January-March estimates due to a lower-than-expected increase in expenses. 

Telecom services provider Bharti Airtel gained 3.9% to 364.55 rupees due to bargain buying after having shed nearly 9.0% over the previous four sessions. 

Among other gainers, Tata Power climbed 2.5% to 1,258.25 rupees.

Sensex losses were led by autos, after data showed local car sales in April grew just 13% from a year earlier, compared with a 30% rise in the fiscal year ended on March 31, as higher loan rates as well as rising fuel prices forced people to put off purchases. 

Maruti Suzuki, India's largest car maker by sales, fell 2.2% to 1,240.40 rupees and  Tata Motors shed 1.9% to 1,178.15 rupees.

Among non-Sensex laggards, SKS Microfinance fell to a new all-time low after swinging to a fiscal fourth-quarter net loss due to a jump in bad-loan provisions. A rating downgrade from Credit Suisse spurred selling as the stock tumbled 18.3% to 270.80 rupees, on top of Friday's near 20% fall.
