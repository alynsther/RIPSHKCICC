 for the construction of a $6-billion steel plant, the southern state's chief minister said Tuesday. 

"We expect ArcelorMittal to start construction of the plant by May," B.S. Yeddyurappa told reporters on the sidelines of an event. 

ArcelorMittal plans to set up a steel plant in the Bellary district with a capacity of six million metric tons a year. 

If the plant sees the light of the day, it would mark ArcelorMittal's first successful foray in steelmaking in the country, as two of its ambitious steel projects in the eastern states of Orissa and Jharkhand have failed to take off due to bureaucratic hurdles and protests by local landowners.
