BRUSSELS—The economic recovery has increased patent filings to record levels, the European Patent Office said Wednesday. 

The EPO, a Munich-based alliance of the European Union's 27 members and 11 neighboring nations, received 235,000 filings in 2010, up 11% from 2009, and the highest number ever in the organization's 34-year history. 

"After a two-year slump, the EU and U.S. are nearly back to their levels of patenting before the crisis," said  Benoit Battistelli, a 60-year-old French lawyer who is the EPO's president. "This, combined with a massive rise in patent applications from Asia, led by China, has made 2010 a record year at the EPO." 

As the world's largest consumer market, many global companies use the EPO to register patents in the EU. 

The number of filings from Chinese companies grew 54%, to 13,000 in 2010. 

Still, the numbers released Wednesday show why European companies are still coveted by China for their technological prowess. 

The top three companies are European. Germany's  Siemens AG, with 2,135 patent filings, and  BASF AG

 with 1,765, is second. 

The EU accounted for 35% of all filings, the highest of any region. 

The fields with the most patents are those dominated by Europeans. Medical technology was first, with 10,500 submissions, followed by computer technology with 8,300 and electrical machinery at 8,200. Telecoms and automobiles have slumped. 

With a staff of around 7,000 and a self-financed annual budget of €1.64 billion ($2.37 billion), the EPO is one of the world's pre-eminent patent bureaus, and it is about to get more power. 

Currently, after applying to the EPO for patent protection, companies have to then register their patent in the EU countries where they want protection. 

On Wednesday, the European Commission is due to publish new rules allowing companies to register in 25 EU countries at once through the EPO. Spain and Italy have declined to participate in the scheme because its working languages are English, French and German. 

The unitary patent system should boost patents in the EU, Mr. Battistelli said. 

"There is a strong link between patent capacity and the growth of the economy," Mr. Battistelli said. 

The percentage of patents successfully granted was 43%, and going down, he added. A few years ago, it was 50%. It takes an average of 40 months for the EPO to grant a patent.
