 Global said in a statement. 

Fortis Global had made two acquisition announcements last month--about buying a controlling stake in Australian dental care services provider Dental Corp. Holdings Ltd. and taking over of an under-construction cancer hospital from Singapore-listed First Real Estate Investment Trust. 

The Singh family has been projecting Fortis Global as the entity for international expansion following an aborted bid for Parkway Holdings Ltd., Singapore's largest hospital chain. In July, Fortis Healthcare bowed out of a bidding race for Parkway and sold its stake of about 25% in Parkway to Malaysia's sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional Berhad. 

"Fortis Global Healthcare's latest acquisition, the fourth in five months, marks an important step in achieving the Singh family's vision of creating a premier global healthcare group outside India," the company statement said. 

Fortis Healthcare now focuses on the Indian hospital business.
