The Tribeca Film Festival on Saturday night announced that Michael Collins's "Give Up Tomorrow" won the festival's Heineken Audience Award. 

Throughout the festival, which wrapped up on Sunday, audiences were able to vote for the award by completing nomination ballots during screenings. "Give Up Tomorrow," which had already received a Special Jury Mention in the festival's World Documentary competition, was also supported by the Tribeca Film Institute's Gucci Tribeca Documentary Fund, and Mr. Collins is an alumnus of the Tribeca Film Institute's Tribeca All Access program. He will receive a cash prize of $25,000.

"Tribeca was there from the beginning," Mr. Collins said in a statement. "They really gave us the introduction to the film world. This award gives us so much hope. Now I know that the film is going to be seen by a broader audience and I'm incredibly grateful." 

"Give Up Tomorrow" tells the story of culinary student Paco Larrañaga, who, at 19 years old in 1997, was arrested for the kidnap, rape and murder of two sisters on the island of Cebu in the Philippines. His subsequent trial, which included demonstrable evidence of his innocence, became a galvanizing focal point for a far-reaching exposé of miscarriage of justice at the highest levels. 

"We hope that the film will raise awareness of Paco's plight and lead to his freedom," said Nancy Schafer, the festival's executive director, in a statement. "This film is remarkably well-crafted and I hope this award brings it the additional visibility it deserves."

Mr. Collins's film came out on top of 93 feature-length movies at the festival, from an initial list of 5,624 submissions—the most in Tribeca's 10-year history.
