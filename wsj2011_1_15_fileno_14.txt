Peaches HotHouse reminds you of a rustic joint in the South, where the focus is on food, not frills. This Bedford-Stuyvesant restaurant, sister to the Smoke Joint and the contemporary Southern-styled Peaches, opened in March. 

Peaches HotHouse in Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood offers rib-sticking egg scrambles and Nashville-style hot chicken.

There are several rib-sticking egg scrambles, including the Country Sausage, which comes with a generous helping of crumbled sausage, red onions and cheddar cheese. All are best with a side of creamy grits. The granola-crusted french toast with peaches and cream is perfect for those who appreciate a big, sweet brunch. No syrup is needed.

The restaurant's name refers to its signature dish, the Nashville-style hot chicken, also on the brunch menu. Served mild, hot and extra hot, it's guaranteed to leave lips tingling and noses running. The restaurant won't reveal its secret recipe but admits to using Bhut Jolokia, aka "ghost chili," more than 400 times hotter than Tabasco sauce. 

Most brunch dishes are $7 to $12. A variety of sides are $3 each. Beer, wine and a variety of brunch "likkers" are served.
