MUMBAI â€“ Indian shares closed sharply lower Thursday, dragged down by lower-than-expected earnings from  Infosys Technologies and as renewed concerns over rising interest rates sparked a selloff in banking stocks. 

The Bombay Stock Exchange's Sensitive Index fell 351.28 points, or 1.8%, to close at 19182.82, after moving between 19136.27 and 19522.38. On the National Stock Exchange, the 50-stock S&P CNX Nifty lost 111.35 points, or 1.9%, to end at 5751.9. 

Trading volume on the BSE decreased to 35.61 billion rupees ($790 million) from Wednesday's 39.81 billion rupees. Gainers lagged decliners 1105 to 1690, while 186 stocks were unchanged. 

"We were expecting the markets to consolidate after yesterday's gains, but the food inflation numbers came as a disappointment," says  Dipan Mehta, director at Dipan Mehta Share and Stock Brokers. 

Food inflation for the week to Jan. 1 was 16.91%, easing from the previous week's 18.32%, but still worryingly high. Vegetable prices shot up 70% year-on-year and 4% from the previous week, government data showed Thursday. 

Mehta said the declines have made the markets vulnerable to a large potential downside of 4%-5% and investors will be closely watching the inflation data for December, due Friday. 

Of the 30 Sensex constituents, 25 stocks closed lower. 

Infosys slid 4.8% to 3212.3 after it lagged analysts' estimates with a 14.2% rise in third-quarter net profit to 17.8 billion, and cautioned that a slow economic recovery in developed markets and currency fluctuations could derail growth of India's outsourcing sector this year. 

Other technology stocks fell, too. 

Tata Consultancy Services, scheduled to release earnings Monday, closed 1.0% lower at 1,124.2 rupees while Wipro was down 2.7% at 455 rupees. 

Banking shares gave up Wednesday's gains on concerns that persistently high food inflation would increase pressure on India's central bank to aggressively raise policy rates. The central bank is widely expected to raise its lending and borrowing rates for the seventh time since March 2010 when it meets to review monetary policy on Jan. 25. 

"Banking stocks have been very volatile in recent sessions and are expected to stay so until banks start reporting earnings from next week," said an analyst with a local brokerage who declined to be identified. 

ICICI Bank lost 3.9% to 1,027.4 while State Bank of India closed 3.9% lower at 2,560.65 rupees. 

Reliance Industries, India's largest company by market capitalization, fell 1.5% to 1,01525 rupees. 

Among gainers, Oil and Natural Gas Corp. rose 1 % to 1,199.3 rupees, tracking a rise in crude prices, which are near a two-year high.  Tata Motors added 1.6% to 1,235.65 rupees while property developer DLF finished 0.6% higher at 265.1 rupees.
