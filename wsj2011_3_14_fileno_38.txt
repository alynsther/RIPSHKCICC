Heightened worries over the financial impact of the earthquake in Japan and ensuing nuclear emergency sent European stocks sharply lower Monday.

In response to the catastrophe, the Bank of Japan jumped into action early in the Asian day to temper the economic blow from the devastation, doubling the size of its asset-purchase program and pouring a record $183.17 billion into money markets to ease liquidity concerns. 

However, the total impact on Japan is unlikely to be fully assessed until the end of this week. "Horrifying estimates of the human toll are mounting, and the financial damage is likely an order of magnitude higher than [the $35 billion] estimate," said  John J. Hardy, a forex consultant with Saxo Bank.

Tokyo's Nikkei Stock Average fell 6.2%, and Mr. Hardy noted that the index is down more than 10% from its close on Wednesday.

Investors were also on edge about further devastation from damaged nuclear reactors. 

"Doubts still remain over the worse-damaged nuclear power plants' abilities to avoid a meltdown and investors will be keeping their fingers tightly crossed in the hope that further catastrophe doesn't happen," said  Angus Campbell, head of sales at Capital Spreads in London.

Against this backdrop, the Stoxx Europe 600 index slid 1% to 272.60. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 index fell 0.9% to 5775.24, France's CAC-40 index shed 1.3% to 3878.04 and Germany's DAX lost 1.6% to 6866.63.

Losses in Europe spiraled further after Wall Street stock indexes fell in reaction to the earthquake. Late in Europe, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.2% at 11903.17 and the Standard & Poor's 500 shed 1.3% to 1287.05.

Shorter-dated U.S. Treasurys rose. The benchmark 10-year note was up 9/32 in price to yield 3.367%.

Insurance stocks were a major focus as investors tried to assess the impact of the earthquake and how much it would cost the reinsurance industry. The Stoxx Europe 600 insurance index dropped 2%.

Earlier, an economic report showed that euro-zone industrial output increased steadily in January by 0.3% from December, although by slightly less than analysts' expectations. 

In the foreign exchanges, the dollar fell against the euro, which climbed after euro-zone leaders agreed to expand the single currency bloc's temporary bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Facility, to its full capacity of â‚¬440 billion. There also was agreement to cut interest rates on Greece's bailout loans by one percentage point. 

The dollar also rose against the yen. While repatriations would tend to buoy the yen, the BOJ liquidity injections, combined with signals from Japanese officials that they could intervene in currency markets if necessary, kept the U.S. dollar supported for now. A strengthening yen could hurt Japan's export-dependent economy.

By late European trade, the common currency was trading at $1.3987 from $1.3903 late Friday in New York. The dollar was at 81.65 yen yen from 81.89 yen.

Late in Europe, light, sweet crude for April delivery was down 88 cents at $100.28 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Gold for April delivery was up 0.34% at $1426.60 per troy ounce late in Europe on the Comex division of Nymex.
