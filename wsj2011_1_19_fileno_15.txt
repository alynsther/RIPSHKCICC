The ObamaCare repeal debate began on the House floor yesterday, generally with more heat than light, but the most over-the-top claim came from the Obama administration: To wit, if the new entitlement that doesn't start until 2014 is abolished, as many as 129 million Americans will lose their health insurance today.

According to a Health and Human Services report released yesterday, somewhere between 19% and 50% of the U.S. population under 65 has some kind of pre-existing condition that leaves them exposed to the ravages of the insurance industry. "Americans living with pre-existing conditions are being freed from discrimination in order to get the health coverage they need," HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said.

Except that most people get health insurance from their employers, who rarely screen for health status, and anyway, they won't even be eligible for ObamaCare. As for the minority who might be helped—those who buy insurance on their own on the individual market—nine out of 10 are offered a policy in today's supposedly ruthless wilderness.

But maybe the best refutation of HHS's claim are the "high risk pools" that ObamaCare did create and are already up and running—and have already bombed. Intended to cover all those insurance refugees supposedly denied coverage, these pools should be covering 375,000 people at the moment, according to HHS projections. Nationwide, around 10,000 people have signed up.

Expect many more such exaggerations as the repeal debate continues.
