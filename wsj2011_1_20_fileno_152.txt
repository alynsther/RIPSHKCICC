A La Turca, one of a handful of Turkish restaurants in San Francisco, serves a wide range of Turkish cuisine to people who live and work in the city's Tenderloin district.

The eatery offers quick meals—including sandwiches and pides, or canoe-shaped flatbreads with a variety of fillings, for $6.75 to $8.50—as well as more traditional, homemade-style dishes such as the popular Turkish dish İskender kebap, comprising slices of lamb and beef slathered in tomato sauce and served over cubes of bread, for $10.25.

Owner  Özgül Yolcu, an Istanbul native who opened A La Turca in 2002, says the restaurant draws lunch diners from a nearby language school and hospital. 

It also attracts government workers from San Francisco's Civic Center neighborhood who are willing to make the trek, such as Janice Brickley, a state employee who recently visited A La Turca with a friend.

"It seems very authentic," says Ms. Brickley, who is planning a trip to Turkey this year. She ordered the chicken kebap sandwich, made with meat cooked on a vertical spit. 

Located at 869 Geary St. in San Francisco, A La Turca is open Sunday through Thursday from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. and Friday through Saturday from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m.
