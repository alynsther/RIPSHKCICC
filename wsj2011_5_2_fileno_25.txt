MUMBAI â€“ India's central bank Monday said inflation may remain elevated in the fiscal year that began on April 1 and the persistence of price pressures warrants continuation of an anti-inflationary monetary stance to ensure growth. 

"Risk to growth from sustained high inflation could condition the stance of the monetary policy in the near-term," the Reserve Bank of India said in a report titled 'Macroeconomic and Monetary Developments in 2010-11', released ahead of Tuesday's quarterly rate-setting meeting. The RBI is widely expected to increase key policy rates at the meeting. 

"Since high inflation itself could disrupt growth, it is important for the monetary policy to ensure a slow inflation environment as a pre-condition for sustained high growth," it added. 

Inflation in India remains stubbornly high, with pricing pressures originally driven by food now spilling over into manufactured products. 

Wholesale price index-based inflation rose 8.98% in March, significantly overshooting market estimates of 8.30%. It also overstepped the RBI's end-March estimate of 8%, which had been revised upward three times. 

The central bank cautioned that there are risks to the deficit projections of 2011-12 as subsidies may exceed the budgeted provisions.
