Here's the current college-basketball Top 25 ranked by how many miles the teams traveled in their non-conference schedules so far (only counting road and neutral-site games).

It's an annual college basketball tradition: Syracuse races to a hot start, soars up the rankings—and immediately catches flak for a cozy early-season schedule that rarely takes it away from New York.

The criticism may be justified. The No. 4 Orange traveled a total of 465 miles during non-conference play—the fourth fewest of any team currently ranked in the top 25. They faced Michigan and Georgia Tech at a tournament in Atlantic City (270 miles, as the crow flies), then took on Michigan State at Madison Square Garden, their unofficial second home (195 miles). Syracuse did not play a true road game until last Saturday at Seton Hall and will not venture outside of New York or New Jersey until it visits Pittsburgh on Jan. 17. 

The only ranked teams to travel fewer miles also hail from the Big East: No. 5 Pittsburgh (315), No. 7 Villanova (179) and No. 18 Louisville (95). The Cardinals played one game away from their home court, against in-state foe Western Kentucky.

Conversely, No. 13 Kentucky leads top-25 programs with 6,890 miles, followed by No. 10 Connecticut with 6,617—both schools played in the Maui Invitational, hence the big numbers. Next is No. 11 Brigham Young, which logged 6,388 miles on six separate road trips, including two journeys to upstate New York about three weeks apart.

It's hard to blame Syracuse and its conference brethren for staying close to home. Eight Big East teams are ranked, and the Orange plays five of them on them on the road. The schedule is difficult enough as is.
