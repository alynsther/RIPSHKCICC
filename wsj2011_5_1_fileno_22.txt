 Q: The Internal Revenue Service lost a court case a few years ago involving stock that a taxpayer had received when a mutual insurance company converted into a stock company. At the time, the IRS said it was studying the court's decision. What is the IRS's position now?  D.L.L., Yorba Linda, Calif. 



 A: "No change," an IRS spokesman replies. 

The spokesman referred to IRS Tax Topic 430, which can be found on the IRS website (www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc430.html). You also can read the IRS's position in Publication 550 and in the 2010 instructions for Schedule D, the form for reporting capital gains and losses. 

Here is some background on the issue: Many insurance companies in recent decades have switched from being mutuals, or owned by their policyholders, into being publicly traded stock companies, which are owned by shareholders. This conversion typically is referred to as a "demutualization."

Suppose you were among the many people who received stock in the process of a demutualization. If you later sell those shares, how do you figure out their cost for capital-gains tax purposes?

The IRS says the correct answer is zero. But, as our reader correctly points out, the IRS lost a court battle over this issue. The U.S. Court of Federal Claims said the taxpayer in the case didn't have any taxable income on the sale of stock in a demutualization case and was entitled to a refund. A federal appeals court affirmed that ruling.

Based on that case, should you challenge the IRS? This can be a complex issue, and you may need to consult an expert, such as a lawyer or an enrolled agent. The lawyer who won the case against the IRS in the Court of Federal Claims is  Burgess J.W. Raby of Tempe, Ariz. (The case is  Eugene A. Fisher, Trustee,  Seymour P. Nagan Irrevo Irrevocable Trust v. the United States.)
