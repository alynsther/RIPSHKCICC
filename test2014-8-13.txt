BALTIMORE—For the first time in 45 years, baseball's owners are publicly split
on electing their next commissioner, with factions backing different
candidates and no clear consensus heading into baseball's equivalent of a
papal election Thursday.

Retiring Commissioner Allan H. "Bud" Selig has long backed his right hand man,
Major League Baseball chief operating officer  Rob Manfred, as his successor.
But recently, a surprising insurrection headed by Chicago White Sox owner
Jerry Reinsdorf has become public, opposing Manfred's candidacy and backing
Boston Red Sox chairman  Tom Werner instead. MLB's Vice President of Business,
Tim Brosnan, is also on the ballot, but isn't expected to command as much
support as the other two candidates.

The MLB commissioner's elections have been a mere formality since the
controversial election of Bowie Kuhn in 1969. So Reinsdorf's surprising
efforts stirred the pot so much that Selig felt compelled to put out a
statement ahead of Wednesday's meeting that the "reports of personal animosity
between Jerry Reinsdorf and me…are unfounded and unproductive."

Wednesday, the owners gathered in a Baltimore hotel to hear hourlong
presentations from the three candidates in advance of Thursday's vote. A
candidate needs 75% of the vote to win, meaning 23 teams, and the question is
whether Manfred has enough votes to prevail.

If no candidate can get the necessary 23 votes, the vote will be tabled to the
next set of meetings in November. That would be a victory for Reinsdorf's
group—as the expectation is that either Manfred will be elected Thursday, or
the situation will be deadlocked; there is little expectation of Werner
winning outright Thursday.

That means that the question of the day Wednesday became whether a
commissioner will be chosen Thursday at all. Most of the parade of owners
leaving the meetings demurred, but Cardinals chairman Bill DeWitt, head of the
search committee that presented the three finalists, was one of several who
hinted that they believe it will get done.

"I'm optimistic," he said—meaning, essentially, that Manfred would carry the
day.

[Hal Steinbrenner](http://topics.wsj.com/person/S/Hal-Steinbrenner/7091),
whose Yankees are believed to be part of the faction of roughly 20 teams
backing Manfred, wouldn't go quite that far. "All three of them are very, very
good candidates, and all three of them did a great job in there expressing
their thoughts about the future, and what they can bring to the game."

But the dissenters subtly made it clear that they didn't expect to go quietly,
with Angels owner Arte Moreno, believed to be in the Reinsdorf bloc, saying he
wasn't so sure a choice will be made Thursday.

Werner wouldn't handicap his own chances, but he emerged from the meeting
seeming pleased with what he had done.

"I think it went well," Werner said. "There will be more conversations
tomorrow."

Manfred wouldn't even go that far, exiting the hotel quickly without
addressing the assembled media.

"I've done enough talking for today," Manfred said.

Washington has its White House, Venice its Campanile, and—in another grand
reconstruction—Berlin will soon have its 18th-century palace.

After much contention and delay, the Hohenzollern Palace, seat of Prussia's
monarchy and the jewel in the city's crown until the East Berlin regime
leveled the building in 1950, has begun rising again.

The interior of the Schloss, or Palace, as it is known, will be modern and
will house university facilities, a museum and a library. Its eastern facade,
overlooking the Spree river, will also be contemporary.

But it is the palace's remaining outer walls, with their historical ornaments,
that have generated the most controversy: Off-site sculptors are crafting an
exact replica of the palace's baroque facade as it was before World War II.

Berlin is joining the ranks of cities whose most famous architectural
landmarks are in fact reconstructions of lost originals with the rebuilding of
Hohenzollern Palace, the seat of Prussia's monarchy. But the plan is not
without controversy.

Since Wilhelm von Boddien, a Hamburg businessman with an aristocratic
background, first floated the idea of rebuilding the Schloss in 1991,
progressive architects have attacked the plan as reactionary, while fiscal
conservatives balked at the €590 million ($788 million) bill. It took two
votes in parliament, in 2002 and 2007, and the decision that the €80 million
facade would be financed by private donations, to tame the discussion. Now
builders are finally erecting the core of the palace on the city's Museum
Island, Berlin's historic center, as nearly two dozen artisans work to
recreate the facade and courtyard piece by piece.

As there are no original plans from Andreas Schlüter—court architect to
Frederick I, whose baroque design updated the 15th-century castle—sculptors
rely upon a variety of clues.

"We have to work on the basis of photos, fragments and bills," said Bertold
Just, who runs the studio in charge of stonemasons. He adds that one of the
most satisfying aspects of the project is how the building is taking shape
through the sculptures that form the building's face.

"The visual language, the methods of working, which tools they had—it's like
stepping into history," says Mr. Just from the studio on the outskirts of
Berlin.

Although aerial bombing badly damaged the Schloss during World War II, the
royal seat was hardly beyond repair when it was dynamited by the East German
authorities to make way for the Palace of the Republic. Before that
demolition, original fragments were salvaged and stored in museums; others
were foraged by passersby and kept in gardens and basements in East Berlin.

Some people, after they heard about the reconstruction, came forward with
sections, Mr. von Boddien says. Significant pieces earned a financial reward.

The sculptors actually do the work four times over. A scale model of an
element, known as a _bozzetto_, is created for approval by an expert
commission. Next comes a life-size duplicate in clay. A plaster cast is then
made—the model from which the final decoration is hand-carved in sandstone.
The list of 2,800 ornaments includes reliefs, elaborate portals, balustrades,
columns, ram's heads, sea shells, Roman gods, eagles and crowns.

The Schloss, scheduled to open in mid-2019, poses "challenges with regard to
deadlines," says Mr. Just. Sculpting just one of the 43 eagles that will adorn
the building takes over a month in clay and two months in sandstone.

Surprisingly, the end of the Cold War made finding qualified craftsmen less
than problematic: German reunification provided a glut of restoration projects
in cities that had been Communist—the former East Berlin, Potsdam,
Dresden—which gave rise to a new generation of stonemasons.

Questions remain as to whether the organizers will raise enough to finance the
facade. About half the budget has been collected so far, including €750,000
from U.S. donors. (Honorary members of the Schloss's U.S. board include George
Bush Sr. and Henry Kissinger.) Mr. von Boddien, now director of the
fundraising association, is optimistic.

"When we first said we wanted to build the palace, everyone said, 'He's crazy,
he'll never manage it,' Mr. von Boddien says from the fundraising office at
the Humboldt Box, a futuristic information center at the palace building site.
And even after raising roughly €40 million, Mr. von Boddien still fields
doubting questions.

"We're always asked about Plan B, in case we don't raise the money," Mr. von
Boddien says, to the thud of a jackhammer outside. "There is no Plan B. We'll
manage it."

Japan's economy was pushed off a cliff in the second quarter, contracting 6.8%
on an annual basis. We say pushed because the drop was due to the April
increase in the consumption tax to 8% from 5%. Much of the effect will be
temporary, since consumers moved big purchases into the first quarter to avoid
the tax. But there is reason to worry that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's
decision to raise the tax will damage his program for economic revival.

Japan has been here before. In 1997 a consumption-tax increase to 5% from 3%

Recep Tayyip Erdogan called his triumph in Turkey's weekend presidential
election a "trophy night for democracy." That's one way to put it. Another is
that Mr. Erdogan is using his success at the polls to move his country toward
a politics of illiberalism that will undermine democracy.

Sunday's vote marked the first time Turks directly elected a president. Mr.
