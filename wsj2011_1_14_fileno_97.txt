LONDON—U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron said Thursday that Britain would not be drawn into fresh mechanisms to solve the euro-zone's problems.

Speaking at a press conference following a meeting with French Prime Minister Francois Fillon, Mr. Cameron said the U.K. supported a strong and successful currency bloc, but indicated that Britain would not be taking part in new strategies to bolster it.

Mr Cameron said: "We want the countries of the euro zone to sort out the difficulties and the problems that they have, and we won't stand in the way as they do that—indeed, we will be a helpful partner in making sure that happens. 

"But that does not mean that Britain should be drawn into new mechanisms or new procedures, or have to give up new powers. That is absolutely not what we see as necessary as happening."

Mr Cameron also said there was "absolutely no chance" of the U.K. joining the currency bloc while he was prime minister. 

Earlier Thursday, Mr. Fillon, in an interview with The Times newspaper in London, urged Mr. Cameron to back further European integration in order to save the euro. 

"The question is: is the U.K. ready to accept or encourage greater integration of the euro zone or is the U.K. distrustful of that and will it create obstacles and make it more difficult to happen," he said.
