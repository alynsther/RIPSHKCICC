Yankee pitcher Phil Hughes is feeling better following a late April cortisone shot, and the Yankees now say they expect him back in six to eight weeks. Hughes saw a specialist Monday to rule out a rare condition called Thoracic Outlet Syndrome, hat would have required season-ending surgery. 

"We're pleased that he doesn't have the Thoracic Outlet Syndrome….But you don't want to lose any pitcher for six to eight weeks," manager Joe Girardi said. 

The Yankees now believe that the issue may be inflammation in his shoulder. Regardless, they are optimistic that they will have a full-strength Hughes back this season.

Knicks guard Toney Douglas had surgery Wednesday to repair a torn labrum in his right shoulder and is expected to be out for 12 to 16 weeks, which could interfere with the start of training camp in the late September. 

Nets center Brook Lopez also had surgery Wednesday. Doctors removed bone mass and calcium deposits from Lopez's arm, which had been bothering him since he was hit earlier in the season. He will resume basketball activity in six weeks, according to doctors,.

The Mets placed reliever Pedro Beato on the 15-day disabled list Wednesday with right elbow tendinitis, three days after he pitched three innings of an extra-innings game against the Philadelphia Phillies. Beato said he felt some tightness in his elbow Tuesday. His absence will hamper the Mets' bullpen, which is also missing the injured Bobby Parnell. The Mets called up lefty Mike O'Connor from Triple-A Buffalo to fill the roster spot.
