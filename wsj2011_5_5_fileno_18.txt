MUMBAI â€“ National carrier Air India Ltd. Thursday called for bids to lease planes and crew from other airlines to tide over an operational crisis caused by an indefinite strike by about 750 of its pilots.

 737, as well as Boeing 777s and Airbus A330s, both used for longer haul flights. 

It didn't elaborate on numbers for either planes or crew. 

The last date for receiving bids is May 12. 

The airline said it needs the planes and crew for local routes, such as the impacted Delhi-Bangalore and Mumbai-Kolkata sectors, as well as some international routes, including Chennai-Singapore. 

The strike was called on April 27, midnight, by pilots who previously belonged to Indian Airlines, which was merged with Air India in August 2007. Almost four years after the two companies were united, the wage structures haven't been aligned, and several Indian Airlines employees continue to be paid less than their Air India counterparts. 

The strike has forced the carrier to cancel several domestic flights in the last few days. Most international flights haven't been disrupted. 

News reports have said Air India is losing at least 100 million rupees ($2.25 million) a day due to the strike, though the airline hasn't confirmed that figure. 

Air India said it flew 198 local and overseas flights Wednesday, but it hasn't given numbers for Thursday.
