Roger Federer lose in the second round of a Grand Slam? Sorry, Gilles Simon, that wasn't going to happen.

Mr. Federer, who has won a record 16 Grand Slam singles titles, gave his fans a scare at the Australian Open on Wednesday, when he needed five sets to beat Mr. Simon of France. Had Mr. Federer lost, it would have been his earliest exit from a major tournament since the 2004 French Open, when he lost in the third round.

Mr. Federer's smoothness often masks his grit. Since Mr. Federer won his first major title, at Wimbledon in 2003, it has taken a command performance to beat him at a Grand Slam. He hasn't lost in the first two rounds in that span and has two total losses in the first four rounds. Rafael Nadal, who has played in 20 fewer majors than Mr. Federer, has four losses in the first four rounds since winning his first Slam in 2005, including a shocking fourth-round loss at the 2009 French Open.

Among the game's legends, Mr. Federer's consistency is remarkable. Even the best of the best have suffered surprising defeats. Pete Sampras took early bows at the U.S. Open in his prime. Andre Agassi could win a title one year and lose in the second round the next. At the 1983 U.S. Open, Bill Scanlon—no legend, he—beat John McEnroe in the fourth round. The only past champ who compares to Mr. Federer is Bjorn Borg, but he had a relatively short career.

At his best, Mr. Federer is nearly unbeatable—this we knew. But perhaps his greatest achievement is that he's almost always at his best.
