Even if the New York Jets don't win the Super Bowl, one must respect how relentless their playoff path has been. In fact, after they meet Ben Roethlisberger and the Pittsburgh Steelers Sunday, the Jets will have faced the toughest gauntlet of opposing quarterbacks—at least in terms of previous playoff games won—in NFL history.

The Jets already have defeated the Colts' Peyton Manning and the Patriots' Tom Brady. Those quarterbacks had a combined 23-13 postseason record entering their games against New York. Facing Mr. Roethlisberger, who has a 9-2 playoff mark, will mean the Jets' slate of opposing quarterbacks had the most wins of any group in a single postseason. The team the Jets will surpass in this category are last year's New Orleans Saints, who mowed through Kurt Warner, Brett Favre and Mr. Manning—three quarterbacks who could occupy their own wing in the Pro Football Hall of Fame one day. If the Jets win Sunday, they'd pad their opposing-QB-victory total in the Super Bowl, but not by much. Chicago's Jay Cutler and Green Bay's Aaron Rodgers both notched their first playoff wins this year. 

Also noteworthy Sunday, the Jets are set to tie the 1993 Buffalo Bills by facing quarterbacks with a combined six Super Bowl wins, the most ever. That Bills team had to play Jeff Hostetler, Joe Montana and Troy Aikman—who owned the same number of rings at the time as Messrs. Brady, Manning and Roethlisberger do now.
