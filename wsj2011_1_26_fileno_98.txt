For years, Spanish football's league championship has been a straight shootout between Real Madrid and Barcelona. This season, the country's premier cup knockout competition is shaping up the same way. 

Ahead of the Copa Del Rey semifinals, which begin on Wednesday, Barça and Madrid are overwhelming favorites with oddsmakers to contest the final in April.

Barcelona, which hosts Almeria in Wednesday's first leg, is 1/50 with Victor Chandler to advance, while Madrid—which travels to Sevilla—is 1/6 with the same firm to reach the final.

Neither bet is particularly attractive despite both clubs being in almost unstoppable form this season.

With homefield advantage, Barça is 1/12 to win Wednesday's fixture at Camp Nou. Instead, consider buying Barcelona's winning margin at 3.3 goals with Sporting Index. It's a high price, but Barça beat Almeria 8-0 in the league this season and has nine wins by at least four goals.

Madrid has also been in outstanding form so far this season, albeit without being quite as devastating in front of goal. Real is odds-on at 19/20 to beat Sevilla at the Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán stadium, but there is better value in backing Cristiano Ronaldo to score anytime at 15/16 with Unibet. 

The Portuguese forward has scored 32 goals from 31 appearances already this season.
