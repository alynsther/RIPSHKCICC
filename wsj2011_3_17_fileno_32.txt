PARIS – French Foreign Minister  Alain Juppé has cancelled a visit to Berlin on Thursday and is instead headed to New York to attend a key United Nations meeting on Libya, a French government official said.

The U.N. Security Council is scheduled to vote later Thursday on a draft resolution aimed at preventing Libya's strongman Col. Moammar Gadhafi from using military force against his own people.

France so far has been struggling to rally support for its idea of conducting air strikes on runways and other military targets in Libya to clip the wings of Col. Gadhafi's air force.
