Samsung Electronics Co. on Friday reported fourth-quarter net profit of 3.42 trillion won, or $3.06 billion, a 12.5% increase from the year-ago period but the most difficult three months of a record-setting year for the company.

Two of the company's four divisions–memory chips and liquid crystal displays, or LCDs–experienced substantially smaller profits in the October-to-December period than they did earlier in the year. Meanwhile, the division that makes TVs, computers and other finished consumer goods experienced a second straight quarterly loss. 

Only Samsung's cellphone division showed improvement against results from earlier in 2010 and over 2009.

Executives said they expect the first half of this year to remain challenging for the memory chip, LCD and consumer-goods businesses. They said they will cut costs and push sales growth in the cellphone division as they count on that unit to be the profit leader for much of 2011.

"We expect the traditional earnings pattern of a weak first half, with a strong second half, to return in 2011,"  Robert Yi, Samsung's investor relations chief, said in a statement.

Samsung's profit compares with 3.04 trillion won in the last three months of 2009. Revenue was 41.9 trillion won, up 6.7% from 39.3 trillion won a year ago.

But the company finished 2010 with a record profit of 16.2 trillion won, well above the record of 10.8 trillion won set in 2004 and also far outpacing 2009's profit of 9.8 trillion won, which had been Samsung's second-most profitable year.

Following the announcement, Samsung shares were flat on the Korea Stock Exchange. Since November, Samsung shares have risen to record levels on investor expectations that the profit downturns in the memory chip and LCD businesses will be short. As well, Samsung has benefited from a global surge of investment money to developing markets like South Korea.

Samsung's chip business, as it usually does, contributed the most to the company's bottom line. Its operating profit margin of 19.5% was up from 16.8% in the fourth quarter of 2009 but down from 32% in the third quarter of 2010.

The cellphone business reported an operating profit margin of 11.9%, up from 10.3% in the year-ago period and 10.2% in the third quarter. The company attributed the gain to greater sales of higher-margin smartphones and the introduction of a tablet computer powered by Google Inc.'s Android operating software. Samsung shipped 80.7 million cellphones in the fourth quarter, up from 68.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2009.

Samsung's LCD component business reported a operating profit margin of just over 1%, down from 7.2% a year ago and 6.4% in the third quarter. The company idled some of its LCD panel production capacity to cope with reduced demand as TV sales grew slower than industry forecasts.

Samsung's consumer-goods division, its largest by revenue, reported a loss of about $150 million despite sharp growth in TV sales. The company is the world's largest TV maker.
