For centuries, the emerald—one of the rarest and priciest gemstones—has been an emblem of rebellious beauties from Cleopatra, whose fetish for green sparklers was almost as storied as her beauty, to Angelina Jolie. 

But the stone's most famous admirer might have to be the late Elizabeth Taylor, who collected more emeralds than husbands in her lifetime—which is saying something. 

Ms. Taylor's fifth (and sixth) husband, Richard Burton, showered her with diamond and emerald jewels from the Italian jeweler Bulgari, starting with a brooch for their first engagement followed by a matching necklace on their wedding day. 

Whether your preference is for modern, Art Deco or emerald look-alikes such as tourmaline or jade, if you're going to go for a big investment this month, opt for the color adored by the biggest jewelry lover—with the biggest heart—of all.
