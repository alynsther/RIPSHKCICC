Brian Rolston and Travis Zajac each had a goal and an assist as the Devils scored four times in the first period Friday night on the way to a victory over the Lightning in Tampa. The Devils' Ilya Kovalchuk scored twice as his team put on a strong offensive display against the Southeast Division's leaders.

Patrik Elias also scored to help the Devils snap an 11-game road losing streak, just one off their record.
