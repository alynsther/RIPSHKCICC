Singapore's economy is rocketing, with an estimated 2010 growth rate of 14.7%. And it's a wealth-management hub for Asia. Until now, however, attempts to start a suitably dynamic art fair have fizzled, with little buzz, weak attendance and low sales.

On Wednesday, the art-fair showman Lorenzo Rudolf hopes to change all that, with the five-day Art Stage Singapore. The fair, which will host 120 galleries, will showcase artists like Pablo Picasso, fashion and art photographer David LaChapelle and sculptor-performance artist Zhang Huan, who's based in Shanghai and New York.

The 50-year-old Mr. Rudolf ran the major Swiss art fair Art Basel from 1991 to 2000, transforming it into an event for serious collectors. He played a role in creating what is now the pre-eminent contemporary art fair in the U.S., Art Basel Miami Beach, as well as ShContemporary, the Shanghai art fair that attracted almost 30,000 visitors to its fourth annual show in September. 

For Art Stage Singapore, he helped sign up established international dealers like France's Emmanuel Perrotin and Britain's Marlborough, along with Asian galleries like South Korea's Arario, Japan's Tomio Koyama and Malaysia's Valentine Willie. Patrick Lecêtre, owner of the modern and contemporary art fair artparis, is the principal of the private company that owns Art Stage Singapore. The Swiss Mr. Rudolf, who splits his time between Singapore and Switzerland, has shares in the enterprise, which will stage its show at the Marina Bay Sands resort. 

Prominent American collectors Don and Mera Rubell say they'll come to the fair, seeing it as a "gateway to the art of the East." 

All of Mr. Rudolf's art fairs have distinguished themselves with strong curated displays. In this case, Collector's Stage, an exhibit organized by the Singapore Art Museum, features works from the holdings of prominent Asian art lovers. It highlights how much of the best contemporary art in Asia is in private hands.
