Apparently, it's the year of the quilt. At least according to the American Folk Art Museum, which is featuring a quilt exhibit in both its East and West Side venues this year, as well as a third one at the Park Avenue Armory called "Infinite Variety: Three Centuries of Red and White Quilts."

On Thursday, nearly 200 supporters previewed the Armory show, where 651 red-and-white quilts from the private collection of  Joanna S. Rose hung from elaborate circular tracks.

"It's a dream world. It's a fantasy. It's spectacular," said guest  Jana Jaffe. "Some of them I'd love to wear myself, to drape them over me."

Guests were instructed to wear red or white. This was, it seemed, a more appealing set of instructions for the women than the men. "I didn't get the memo on red," claimed Citigroup Chairman  Richard Parsons. 

"My underwear is red," said  Jerry Lauren, an executive vice president of Ralph Lauren, "but I'm not going to show it to anyone."

At the gift shop, those who wanted to make a deeper inquiry into quilts could purchase books like "Start Quilting," "City Quilts," "Crazy Quilting," or even "You Did What in the Ditch?: Folklore of the American Quilter."

For the festive meal,  Cornelia Guest designed a menu of leek and watercress soup and lobster Newburg from early American dinners at the White House "Kids today," Ms. Guest said, "They go home, they go on the computer. It's a shame they're not quilting."
