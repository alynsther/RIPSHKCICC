NEW YORKâ€”The Dow Jones Industrial Average posted its first down session of the year on Thursday, as retail and telecommunications shares lagged and euro-zone debt worries resurfaced. 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 25.58 points, or 0.2%, to 11697.31. The Nasdaq Composite edged up 7.69, or 0.3%, to 2709.89. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index shed 2.71, or 0.2%, to 1273.85.

The S&P 500's telecommunications sector tumbled nearly 2.8%. Leading the declines,  MetroPCS Communications tumbled 96 cents, or 6.7%, to $13.30 after the prepaid wireless provider disclosed its fourth-quarter subscriber growth slowed from the prior period.  AT&T fell 40 cents, or 1.4%, to 29.15 after cutting its price for  Apple's iPhone 3GS to $49 from $99 as the carrier prepares for heightened competition from a Verizon Wireless iPhone launch expected early this year.  Verizon Communications, which operates Verizon Wireless as a joint venture with  Vodafone, slid 95 cents, or 2.6%, to 36.23. 

Retailers also lagged in the wake of a soft round of December same-store sales figures, which largely fell short of analysts' expectations.

"I don't know if that says more about the retailers or about the expectations," said  Max Bublitz, chief markets strategist at SCM Advisors. The recent crop of better-than-expected economic data may have spurred too much optimism for consumer spending, he said. "Expectations are probably beginning to exceed reality a little bit."

  Gap fell 1.53, or 6.9%, to 20.70 after reporting a surprise drop in December sales, with particular weakness at its namesake stores in North America.  Target dropped 4.01, or 6.8%, to 54.93 after same-store sales increased only 0.9% last month, falling far short of analysts' estimates.

Department-store operators were largely lower after same-store figures missed analysts' expectations.  Macy's fell 1.00, or 4%, to 23.97, while  Kohl's shed 1.67, or 3.1%, to 52.23 after missing Street expectations, though the retailer raised the low end of its earnings forecast for the fourth quarter.

A handful of teen retailers also came in below Street forecasts, including  Zumiez, which plunged 2.23, or 8.4%, 24.44, and  Wet Seal, down 45 cents, or 12%, to 3.46.

However, investors noted that ferocious snowstorms in late December may have pushed some post-holiday shopping into January.

Worries in the euro-zone debt markets flared up after the European Union proposed a framework for dealing with bank and investment-firm failures that asked whether bondholders should share the burden in paying for future bailouts.

"People are realizing there's still risk," said  Pete Sorrentino, senior portfolio manager at Huntington Funds. "There's still some concerns that are not over with, and that's sobered some people up."

The worries weighed on the euro and boosted the dollar. Investors, fresh off a run of three straight days of gains for the Dow, pulled away from riskier assets.

In U.S. economic data, Thursday's weekly jobless-claims report fueled mounting hopes that the labor market is strengthening. The number of U.S. workers filing new claims for jobless benefits rose slightly less than economists' expected, though the previous week's figures were revised modestly upward. The weekly jobs data came on the heels of an unexpected surge seen Wednesday in private-sector jobs last month, which prompted optimistic investors to revise upward their estimates for Friday's key government nonfarm-payrolls report.

Among stocks in focus, graphic-chip maker  Nvidia rallied 2.35, or 14%, to 19.33 after announcing late Wednesday that it is developing its first computer processor aimed at mainstream computing, a move that makes the company a direct challenger to  Intel and  Advanced Micro Devices. Shares of Intel fell 17 cents, or 0.8%, to 20.77, while Advanced Micro Devices slid 22 cents, or 2.5%, to 8.69.

  TJX, parent of off-price chains T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, gained 2.52, or 5.9%, to 45.52 after raising its earnings outlook for the fourth quarter, pointing to growth in the number of customer transactions.

Shares of seed giant  Monsanto rose 1.66, or 2.4%, to 70.79 after the company swung to a first-quarter profit, boosted by growth in its seeds and genomics business.

  Moody's added 2.35, or 8.6%, to 29.67, after raising its 2010 forecast a second time in three months, saying it benefited from robust bond issuance in the fourth quarter and accelerated completion of software projects for its analytics customers. 

Crude-oil prices fell to settle below $89 a barrel, while gold futures advanced.

Demand for Treasurys rose, pushing yield on the 10-year note down to 3.40%.
