WASHINGTONâ€”A blue-ribbon panel investigating the financial crisis has made several referrals of factual evidence from its probe to law-enforcement agencies over the last year, according a person familiar with the matter.

The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, established by Congress, has made the referrals to other agencies as possible evidence of wrongdoing has come to light during the course of its investigation, this person said. 

Details of the referrals couldn't be learned. 

The referrals could include matters of potential interest to civil or criminal authorities at the federal and state levels, including the U.S. Department of Justice, this person said. The referrals don't necessarily mean that any charges will result.

The commission was formed by Congress to investigate the causes of the financial crisis. Its final report is due to be released on Thursday and is expected to delve into multiple causes of the 2008 meltdown. 

Much of its focus has been on the packaging and sale of mortgage securities on Wall Street, but it also has examined mortgage originations, as well as a range of actions by regulators and other policy makers in Washington and elsewhere, as well as economic factors. One of its explicit powers is the ability to refer matters to other agencies for further investigation.

A spokesman said only that the commission takes its referral authority seriously.
