In recent years, the Brooklyn Museum Artists Ball amused its loyal trustees with everything from Murakami-designed placemats to edible Warhol piñatas. This year, A-lister chairwomen like Sarah Jessica Parker and Liv Tyler braved the Obama-induced traffic and yes, crossed the bridge, giving the haute outer borough gala a very welcome boost.

While Ms. Parker "chaired" for all of 14 minutes before jetting back to Manhattan, Ms. Tyler was fully committed to her duties. "I've never stepped into this museum before but I've made quite a few pilgrimages to Brooklyn with my son," said the actress. "Dustin Yellin is one of my best teenage friends so I've visited his studio with my [son] Milo.

We paint and make the coolest things with him."

The artists in attendance helped fashion each table as it if were a new work. Mr. Yellin created one of the evening's most outstanding ones, highlighted by his sculptures. "I thought about collages, clouds and other great things in life," he said.

 Shinique Smith fashioned a Western-themed potluck. "It features real bills and coins," explained Ms. Smith. "So everyone sitting here will be a bit richer tonight."

The night's honorees included the artists Fred Tomaselli and Lorna Simpson, whose daughter Zora Casebere was the night's youngest attendee. "I helped her get ready for the party," Zora said of her mother. "But honestly, her outfit isn't new tonight."
