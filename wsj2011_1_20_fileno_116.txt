Restaurant owners can relax: Those whose establishments earn an A grade at their first or second inspection under the city's letter grading system will no longer pay fines.

Mayor  Michael Bloomberg announced the change in his State of the City speech Wednesday, eliciting instant praise from the restaurant industry, which has complained about what it viewed as excessive fines.

"The cost of fines cuts into the tight profit margins that small businesses run," said Mr. Bloomberg during his speech. "So from now on, we will add a new incentive: any restaurant that earns an 'A'—either on its initial inspection or on a re-inspection—will not have to pay one penny in fines for any violations found on that inspection. Not one penny."

The change follows months of complaints from restaurant owners that they were racking up thousands of dollars in fines because of more frequent inspections. The city is projecting that it will collect $36.3 million from restaurant fines in the fiscal year ending June 30. Last fiscal year the city collected $32.9 million, up from $27.8 million in the previous year.

The city's grading system launched in late July. During inspections, food establishments are given violation points related to cleanliness and food-safety practices; the lower the score, the better the grade. Restaurants eventually receive an A, B or C letter grade that they must post.

But each point translates into fines, so even restaurants scoring an A on their first inspection previously had to pay fines. 

The change was welcomed by restaurateurs. "My god, that's awesome news," said  Paul Grieco, co-owner of Hearth restaurant and Terroir wine bars. "The fines seemed obscene."
