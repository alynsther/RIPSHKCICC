Last week, Kodak, a player in digital-book printing, hosted a two-hour roundtable discussion titled "The Future of Book Publishing." Eight industry executives—and a blogger from themommyblog.net—gathered in the Trustees Room at the New York Public Library, where Publisher's Weekly Editorial Director Jim Milliot guided them through a conversation about the industry's hopes and fears.

We roughly tabulated the time they spent discussing each major topic proposed by Mr. Milliot, represented by the graphic. 

Many of the panelists waxed poetic about the imperiled printed book, and 10 minutes were spent on the digital-era "print on demand" process, where new copies of a book are not printed until an order has been received. The topic of inventory—big runs and returns—also loomed large. "In the last 10 years," said Jim Robinson, the vice president of operations and administration at Harlequin, "forecasting has waffled from good to poor."

Panelists seemed most hopeful when discussing social networking, apps, and enhanced e-books—advances that multiply the ways in which books become "discoverable" to the public. After the discussion, Jeffrey Matthews, vice president for corporate strategy at Scholastic, wished the group had had more time to "deconstruct the reading process." 

"What is a book?" he asked rhetorically. "That's the $64 million question."
