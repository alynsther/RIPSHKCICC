Robust gains for resource and automobile stocks boosted China's main stock index despite sharp losses for property stocks that followed a fresh set of government measures to control home prices.

Most Asian markets climbed Thursday.

"I think it's just a technical rebound," said Conita Hung, head of equities at Delta Asia Financial Group. "Before the weekend, there will be concerns that the Chinese government may raise interest rates again and I don't expect the market to jump sharply." 

Investor sentiment in the region was also underpinned by the U.S. Federal Reserve's unanimous decision to continue with its $600 billion bond-purchase plan to support the economy. 

The Shanghai Composite advanced 1.5% to 2749.15. Property developers tumbled after Beijing decided to raise the minimum down payment on second-home purchases to 60% from 50% Wednesday. The State Council also called on local authorities to set reasonable 2011 property-price targets by the end of the first quarter and decided to limit home purchases in some cities. Poly Real Estate Group dropped 4.3% in Shanghai and China Vanke fell 2.5% in Shenzhen.

But the strength of commodity prices on Wednesday lifted resource stocks in Shanghai, while automobile stocks also advanced on hopes for an improvement in 2011 sales. 

Jiangxi Copper rose 3.8% and Zhongjin Gold climbed 4.5%, while SAIC Motor added 2.8%.

In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index fell 0.3% to 23779.62. The fall in mainland property shares pushed the market lower, with China Overseas Land & Investment skidding 4.9% and China Resources Land giving up 3.9%.

"The authorities are waiting for property-price inflation to slow to below 6.0%, which we expect will occur" in the first quarter of 2011, said ING economist Prakash Sakpal. If this slowdown doesn't occur, officials' next step would be to introduce a property tax, he said.

In Tokyo, the Nikkei Stock Average rose 0.7% to 10478.66 as expectations mounted for strong earnings reports. Weakness in the yen against the euro added support. News that Standard & Poor's cut Japan's credit rating came after the market closed.

Fanuc jumped 4.6% and Kyocera advanced 1.2% on growing expectations for solid earnings. Exporters were also broadly higher; Sony rose 1.7% and Sharp gained 0.9%.

Toyota Motor was up 1.2% after falling Wednesday on news the firm will recall more than 1.7 million vehicles world-wide due to faulty parts, including defective fuel devices.

In Sydney, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 ended little changed at 4806.09. Engineering group Downer EDI tumbled 20.1% after announcing a $250 million Australian dollar ($247.8 million) write-down on a train-building contract for the state of New South Wales. The firm announced a A$190 million provision on the same contract in June last year, putting the deal in a loss-making position.

South Korea's Kospi index rose 0.2% to 2115.01. Singapore's Straits Times index was marginally lower at 3219.83. 

In Mumbai, the Sensitive Index dropped 1.5% to 18684.43. Banks lost ground on fear that rising costs for deposits might cut into interest-rate margins. Automobile and property companies fell on concern rising interest rates might hurt demand.

Shares of ICICI Bank slipped 2.1%. Real-estate company DLF slid 5.4% and Mahindra & Mahindra, a maker of tractors and utility vehicles, slid 4.9%.

In currency trading, the Japanese yen slumped against major currencies in late Asian trade after ratings agency Standard & Poor's cut Japan's long-term sovereign-credit rating to AA minus from AA, saying it expects Japan's fiscal deficits to remain high in the next few years, "which will further reduce the government's already weak fiscal flexibility."

The U.S. dollar was buying 82.91 yen, compared with 82.16 yen late Wednesday in New York, while the euro was fetching 113.33 yen from 112.65 yen.

The euro was changing hands for $1.36666 from $1.3711.

Lead Japanese government bond futures were up 0.17 at 139.78 points. The 10-year cash bond yield was down 0.5 basis point at 1.225%.
