Though Tuesday is the first day of college football's offseason, the sport's coaching carousel has been spinning for weeks. The most surprising stop was made by Charlie Weis, who traded in his offensive-coordinator position with the Kansas City Chiefs for the same gig at Florida. His move back to the college ranks prompted a twist on a familiar question: Should universities hire more coaches with NFL backgrounds?

We looked at the head coaches, offensive coordinators and defensive coordinators for the 66 major-conference schools, plus Notre Dame, and found that with a few high-profile exceptions, NFL experience isn't a great recipe for success on Saturdays. Most notably, Pittsburgh's Dave Wannstedt, the former Bears and Dolphins head coach, resigned under pressure in December. Meanwhile, California, Virginia and Oregon State all finished below .500 despite the gaudy NFL résumés of their coaches. The staff that logged the most NFL years was Stanford's. New 49ers coach Jim Harbaugh and his coordinators, David Shaw and Vic Fangio, combined to coach in the NFL for 35 years, and the 12-1 Cardinal were better for it. 

But Monday's BCS championship game was more proof that coaches can do just fine without NFL grooming. Of the game's two coaches and four coordinators, only Oregon defensive coordinator Nick Aliotti made a pit stop in the NFL, while Auburn's troika was one of 21 that's never worked on Sundays.
