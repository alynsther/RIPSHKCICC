Senate Democrats blinked this week and agreed to some budget cuts in exchange for GOP support of a two-week extension of funding for the government. The reason was simple: the polls.

While neither party is itching for a shutdown, both are nervous about the political consequences. And two new polls show that the public would spread the blame around if a government shutdown occurred.

The Pew Research folks found in a poll of all adults that 36% would blame the GOP more, versus 35% who would blame Democrats. A week before the 1995 government shutdown, polls showed the public blamed Republicans by a 2-to-1 margin.

A key reason why those numbers diverge from 1995 is that Democrats lack a boogeyman Republican to blame. Back in 1995, a full 54% of the public viewed House Speaker Newt Gingrich unfavorably. Today, only 25% have a negative view of Speaker John Boehner.

A separate survey taken for the Hill newspaper found that 43% of voters would blame both Republicans and Democrats for a shutdown. But among independent voters, 34% would blame Democrats more and only 19% would fault the GOP more.

It's poll numbers like those that have left both parties nervous about doing anything that turns out the lights at a federal agency.
