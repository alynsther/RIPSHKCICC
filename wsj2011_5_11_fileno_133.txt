DENVER—Chris Iannetta's solo home run in the seventh inning Monday dealt the Mets a 2-1 loss to the Colorado Rockies. But the Mets could hardly point to the Rockies catcher—or their own pitcher, Chris Capuano—as the reason for the loss.

The biggest reason was a familiar one: missed chances with runners in scoring position. The Mets finished 0 for 7 in that department, wasting a quality outing from Capuano, who allowed only the two runs on five hits in 6 2/3 innings. In their last eight games, the Mets are just 11 for 77 (.142) with runners in scoring position.

The Mets' lone run came in the sixth inning, when Jason Bay reached first on a throwing error by Ian Stewart, allowing Carlos Beltran to score from third.
