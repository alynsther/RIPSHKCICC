Each of the 3,000 photographs featured in the 2011 New York Photo Festival took a different path to get to Dumbo, where they will be on display May 11-16 at more than 11 venues throughout the neighborhood. To get a sense of how a picture becomes part of an event like this one, we asked the festival's curator, Enrico Bossan, to specify how he became aware of the work of the 14 photographers he will feature in "Hope: Between Dream and Reality." The exhibit highlights the work of young artists who are, in his words, "fresh and clear like a child but honest enough to see reality." 

A photojournalist himself, Mr. Bossan heads the photography department at Benetton's "talent incubator," Fabrica. His exhibit is, he said, "the result of years of work in trying to discover new talent."

What emerges are the many points of contact between scout and artist: Some photographers in his show were aided by an award, others by a connected friend, still others from their own websitesâ€”like 30 year-old Andrea Gjestvang, whose site of photographs taken of Greenland Mr. Bossan stumbled upon while researching a separate project on the North Pole. 

While whittling the final 14 down from more than 100 photographers, he conceded that he tried, as much as possible, to ignore how he'd first been introduced to the works. "Not to be influenced is the hardest thing," he said. "I like to forget who suggested me to the photographer, and just watch the picture."
