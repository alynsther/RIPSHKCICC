  Q: Why are the bottoms of sweaters and blouses so long so they don't look neat when you wear them outside? If you try to tuck them in your skirt or pants, you've got all that fabric bunching underneath. I hate the "oversized" slouchy appearance. Are there any ways to avoid this?

A: Your complaint is probably my No. 1 pet peeve. It seems impossible to find a top or sweater that doesn't fall well below the waistband. 

Back in the mid-1990s, all kinds of bodysuits—leotard-like tops that often snapped underneath the body—were popular, allowing a woman to achieve the streamlined look of tucked-in sportswear. For years, I used to carefully choose sweaters and tops cropped just short enough that the bottom ribbing covered the waistband of my pants or skirts. 

But the advent of low-rise pants caused clothing makers to offer tops that were longer in general, and these days, alas, cropped tops are almost impossible to find. Pants' waistlines are starting to rise again, so I expect to see more short tops and cardigans in the mix. But for now, I pick from the limited selection of knit bodysuits at American Apparel, Top Shop and Forever 21. 

Why not consider a dress that garment makers like to call a "two-fer"? It looks like blouse neatly tucked into a skirt, but it's really a one-piece garment made of two different fabrics, popularized by designers such as Rachel Roy. 

Also, you can employ this trick from fashion stylists on photo shoots: Use sharp scissors to whack any top to the right length. To prevent unraveling, your local tailor can cheaply top-stitch a shirttail hem.
