MUMBAI --Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC has said it has paid 100,000 rupees ($2,215) to settle an inquiry by India's capital markets regulator into why the company didn't obtain approvals for indirect changes in control of its Indian equities unit.

The bank has settled the matter with the Securities and Exchange Board of India, a bank spokeswoman said. 

A notice on the regulator's website showed that RBS Equities (India) settled the issue "without admission or denial of guilt" and that SEBI has dropped all proceedings initiated against the company. 

The regulator in 2009 had asked RBS why action shouldn't be taken against the company for failing to seek prior approvals for changes in its ownership structure on two occasions. The first was in late 2007 when RBS, after acquiring ABN Amro's global assets, integrated its Indian unit and renamed ABN AMRO Asia Equities as RBS Equities (India); and then in 2008, when the U.K. government acquired a majority stake in RBS during the global financial crisis.
