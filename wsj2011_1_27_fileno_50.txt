Eric Staal scored two goals and assisted on another to help the Carolina Hurricanes beat the Islanders on a snowy Wednesday night in Uniondale.

Zach Boychuk and Brandon Sutter also scored and Cam Ward made 23 saves for Hurricanes. Ninth in the Eastern Conference, Carolina has won three of its last four games.

Michael Grabner and Andrew MacDonald scored for the Islanders.

Snow limited the announced attendance to 4,976, the second-smallest crowd at the Coliseum this season. Only 3,136 attended on Dec. 26 because of a blizzard.
