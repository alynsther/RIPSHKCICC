PARISâ€”Operations at the French oil terminal Fos Lavera have resumed after port authorities suspended activities following a blast at the Gazechim plant on Thursday killed one worker and injured another, according to local police. 

The explosion didn't cause major pollution from the plant that processes chlorine, soda and bleach, said  Roger Reuter, the head of the local police at Istres town, where the plant is located, near the Fos Lavera terminal. 

He said some chlorine gas leaked from the factory but it was a small amount and far from any houses. Firefighters are still securing the area, Mr. Reuter said. 

For a couple of hours after the blast, which happened a little before 0800 GMT, workers from ships and port facilities were locked in their workplaces to avoid contact with any possible pollution, a spokeswoman from the port authority said. Workers were authorized to resume work in all the terminals except Gazechim and the neighboring gas storage Geogaz. 

The spokeswoman said the Gazechim plant has no direct connection with the port facilities. No officials at Gazechim, which is privately owned, were immediately available for comment.
