OTTAWAâ€”Canadian Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty won't be among the high-level participants at a currency seminar in China at the end of the month, amid speculation the government could fall as a result of next week's budget. 

According to people familiar with the situation, Mr. Flaherty isn't attending the high-level seminar March 31 in Nanjing, where attendees will include a number of G-20 finance ministers. Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney will be at meeting, a central bank spokeswoman said. 

Mr. Flaherty's spokesman couldn't immediately be reached to comment. 

Mr. Flaherty will present the 2011 budget on Tuesday. The government will fall if the budget isn't supported by at least one of the three opposition parties as the ruling Conservatives don't command a majority of seats in the House of Commons, the elected lower house of Parliament. 

Other than budget votes, the government could also fall if the main opposition moves a motion of no confidence on March 25 and it is backed by a majority of lawmakers. 

Mr. Flaherty is scheduled to host a meeting of finance ministers of the Americas and Caribbean in Calgary on March 25-26.
