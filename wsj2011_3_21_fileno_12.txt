ROME—Forces loyal to Col. Moammar Gadhafi have seized an Italian ferry in the port of Tripoli, detaining its crew, a senior Italian official and the ship's owner said Sunday. 

The crew of the Asso 22—eight Italians, two Indians and one Ukrainian—was detained Saturday evening by armed port guards who boarded the ship, according to  Mario Mattioli, chief executive of Augusta Offshore spa, a Naples-based shipping company that owns the vessel.

"Unfortunately the Asso 22 has been caught up in this situation," Mr. Mattioli said, adding that he was in contact with Italian authorities about the matter.

The ship is one of several vessels that regularly ferry employees from a nearby oil rig operated by Italian energy company  Eni SpA to Tripoli, Mr. Mattioli said. A group of Libyan Eni employees, who work on the rig, had taken the Asso 2 to Tripoli and safely disembarked on Saturday before the ship was commandeered, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Italian officials said it was unclear why the ship's crew was detained but signaled the move by Libyan forces could be linked to Italy's role in enforcing the no-fly zone over Libya.

"We don't know the intentions" of Col. Gadhafi's regime, Foreign Minister  Franco Frattini told Italian TV on Sunday, adding that "we cannot exclude (the possibility) they've been taken hostage."

Italy, which has deep economic ties with Libya, has backed military action against  Col. Gadhaffi's regime, providing U.N.-sanctioned forces with use of its seven military base to operate a no-fly zone over Libya. Italy has also imposed European Union sanctions on the regime freezing assets such as Libya's 7.5% stake in Italian bank  UniCredit
