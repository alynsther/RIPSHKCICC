MADRIDâ€”Spain met its overall 2010 budget deficit target, an important milestone in its efforts to repair its battered finances, though most of the country's powerful regions posted budget overruns. 

Spain's 2010 budget deficit was equal to 9.24% of gross domestic product, ahead of its 9.3%-of-GDP target, and down from 11.1% of GDP in 2009. Spain is forecasting a 2011 deficit of 6% of GDP and plans to bring the gap in line with the 3%-of-GDP limit for European Union countries by 2013. 

"We can now be confident of meeting our 2011 targets," Spanish Finance Minister Elena Salgado told journalists. "Though it's true that regional administrations will have to have to make a very determined effort to reduce their deficits." 

Spain is grappling with the collapse of a decade-long housing boom that pushed the economy into recession, sent unemployment spiraling and punched a big hole in its public-sector accounts. 

As a result, the country's borrowing costs have soared as investors fret that Spain won't be able to pay off its debts. To avoid the fates of Greece and Ireland, which required external support when they were effectively frozen out of financial markets, Spain has pushed through steep budget cuts and economic changes. 

The country's financial overhaul, however, is made more complicated by the decentralized nature of the Spanish state. In 2010, the majority of the 17 regional governments that collectively control over a third of spending in Spain breached their budget targets. Overall, the regions had a budget deficit equal to 2.83% of GDP, higher than their 2.4%-of-GDP target. 

The central government compensated for the overrun with a budget deficit equal to 4.97% of GDP, better than its 5.9% target.
