 GRIPPIER MITTS 

Gloves are meant to keep your hands warm, but they only work when they're actually on your hands, not tucked under your arm as you reach for keys, tie your shoelaces, pull out a stick of Juicy Fruit or do anything requiring more dexterity than making a snowball. Might as well just wear mittens, right? The Arc'teryx Alpha SV Glove fixes the immovable finger problem. By fusing a waterproof layer to the inside of its leather digits (which is a more pliable material than the Gore-Tex used in the bottom part of the glove), there's less shifting fabric that gets in the way. Additionally, the seams are moved away from the fingertips making your hands more tactile. They're super-breathable considering the warmth they provide, but if you ever do need to wash the Alpha SVs after a sweaty day on the hill, you can remove the fleece lining. arcteryx.com, $275 

 FROST-FIGHTING BOOTS 

 You know that comforting relief of coming indoors and putting your feet by the heater after a long day of snowshoeing or, more realistically, shoveling your driveway after a blizzard? Columbia's Bugathermos let you take that feeling outdoors. While the boots are warm on their own, heat pads powered by small rechargeable batteries provide that extra bit of toastiness when you need it most, and can last up to eight hours on the lowest of the three temperature settings. Think of these shoes as the footwear equivalent of hot cocoa. columbia.com, $325
