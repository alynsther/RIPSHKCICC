WASHINGTON--President Barack Obama said Saturday that a national goal for generating electricity from "clean" sources could provide "certainty" for clean-energy companies, echoing a major theme from his State of the Union speech during his weekly radio address.

Mr. Obama renewed his push to require America's electricity generators to get 80% of their energy from "clean" sources like nuclear power, biofuels, wind, solar, so-called clean coal, and others by 2035. 

To give clean energy companies "the certainty of knowing there will be a market for what they sell, I've set this goal for America," he said.

 Inc. in Wisconsin, where he gave a speech on Friday, Mr. Obama continued his call for America to "win the future" by investing in transportation and internet infrastructure, education, and research. 

He called for research tax credits for companies. 

"We'll win the future by being the best place on Earth to do business. That is what we are called to do at this moment," Mr. Obama said. 

Convincing Congress to view those sorts of investments as worthwhile rather than wasteful will be a hurdle for the president in coming weeks as officials in Washington work to develop the federal government's budget. 

"We have to reform our government and cut wasteful spending, so that we eliminate what we don't need to pay for the investments we need to grow," Mr. Obama said.
