MUMBAI â€“ Indian shares ended higher Monday as falling crude prices boosted investor sentiment and outweighed a higher-than-expected inflation reading for February, with heavyweight Reliance Industries leading gains. 

The Bombay Stock Exchange's Sensitive Index rose 265.39 points, or 1.5%, to close at 18439.48 after moving between 18155.43 and 18463.84. 

Trading volume on the BSE fell to 29.75 billion rupees ($660 million) from Friday's 39.92 billion rupees. Gainers outnumbered decliners 1,519 to 1,329, while 145 stocks were unchanged. 

On the National Stock Exchange, the 50-stock S&P CNX Nifty gained 86.05 points, or 1.6%, to end at 5531.05. 

Among Asian markets, Japan's Nikkei slumped 6.2% as the country struggled to deal with the fall-out of a powerful earthquake that struck its northern coast Friday and spawned a tsunami. However, Hong Kong's Hang Seng and China's Shanghai Composite recovered from early declines to close up 0.4% and 0.1%, respectively. 

"The [Indian] market has reacted predictably to the softening of oil prices and the absence of a major event over the weekend in the Middle East and North Africa. The impact of the quake in Japan on global markets was also limited today [Monday]," said  Dipan Mehta, director at Dipan Mehta Share & Stock Brokers. 

Benchmark Nymex crude for April delivery was trading at $99.07 a barrel, $2.09 below its previous settlement. 

Mr. Mehta added that softening crude prices will ease inflationary expectations. 

Government data released Monday showed the wholesale price index rose 8.31% in February from a year earlier, quicker than January's provisional 8.23% rise and higher than the 7.8% forecast in a Dow Jones Newswires poll of 15 economists. 

Mr. Mehta expects the market to trade in a narrow range in the coming sessions in the absence of major triggers. 

Of the 30 Sensex constituents, 25 ended higher Monday. 

Gains were led by Reliance Industries, India's largest company by market capitalization, as investors bet rebuilding activity in Japan will increase the demand for petroleum products. The stock ended up 2.6% at 1,017.65 rupees.

Steel led gains in metal shares on expectations the disruption of supplies from Japan would increase demand for steel and boost prices. Tata Steel rose 3.3% to 601.05 rupees while  Jindal Steel & Power closed 2.1% higher at 664.25 rupees. 

Among non-Sensex gainers, Reliance Capital jumped 9.7% to 561.80 rupees after the company said it has agreed to sell a 26% stake in its life insurance unit to Japan's Nippon Life Insurance Co. for 30.62 billion rupees. The news also buoyed shares of other Reliance Group firms founded by billionaire  Anil Ambani. Reliance Communications rose 4.4% to 100.50 rupees while Reliance Infrastructure climbed 3.5% to 625.70 rupees. Both companies are part of the Sensex. 

In technology,  Infosys Technologies, which has a more than 10% weight in the Sensex, rose 1.5% to 3,099.25 rupees while Tata Consultancy Services ended 1.9% higher at 1,096.65 rupees. 

Among the handful of Sensex losers, Bharti Airtel shed 0.4% to finish at 321.55 rupees.
