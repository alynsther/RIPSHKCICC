MUMBAI -- Reliance Industries Ltd. Friday posted a 28% rise in third-quarter net profit, helped by strong performances in its refining and petrochemicals business.

India's largest listed company by market value had a net profit of 51.36 billion rupees ($1.12 billion) for the three months to Dec. 31, compared with 40.08 billion rupees a year earlier.

Sales rose to 597.89 billion rupees from 568.56 billion rupees.

Profit, however, lagged the 53 billion rupees average of estimates in a poll of 10 analysts.

The company, controlled by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, improved its gross margin from refining a barrel of crude in the October-December quarter to $9 a barrel from $5.9 a barrel a year earlier.

Analysts had expected Reliance Industries, India's largest private-sector refiner by capacity, to post a gross refining margin of $9 a barrel. Gross refining margin was $7.9 a barrel in the second quarter.

Reliance Industries operates the world's single largest refinery complex at Jamnagar in the western state of Gujarat, with a nameplate crude processing capacity of 1.24 million barrels a day, which is about one third of India's refining capacity.

In the third quarter, the company refined 16.1 million tonnes of crude and the refinery operated at an average utilization rate of about 104%.

"The utilization rate was lower [from the year earlier] due to a planned shutdown of one train of the crude distillation unit for 22 days in the third quarter," Reliance Industries said.

Revenue from the refining business rose to 525.24 billion rupees from 480.00 billion rupees.

Petrochemicals revenue during the quarter also rose to 159.62 billion rupees from 147 billion rupees.

"On the back of strong domestic demand growth, lack of adequate new capacities globally and historically high cotton prices, the polyester chain witnessed robust margin environment," the company said.

For the nine months ended Dec. 31 production from KG D6 was 6.43 million barrels of crude oil and 559 billion cubic feet of natural gas, the company said. The company didn't provide production figures for the KG-D6 for the October-December quarter.

However, natural gas production from the Panna-Mukta fields off India's west coast fell 32% to 34 billion cubic feet and crude oil production fell 38% to 6.21 million barrels from a year earlier. Gas production from the Tapti fields in west India also fell 10% to 74 BCF.
