Asian markets came under renewed selling pressure, led by Shanghai and Hong Kong stocks, after Chinese data underscored Beijing's need to tighten monetary policy to rein in price pressures. 

The data weighed on regional shares on a day when financial stocks were already weak in some markets after Wall Street retreated Wednesday, after disappointing earnings from big U.S. banks, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. 

The Shanghai Composite index tumbled 2.9% to 2677.65, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index shed 1.7% to 24003.70, Japan's and Australia's indexes each fell 1.1%, with the Nikkei Stock Average closing at 10437.31 and the S&P/ASX 200 at 4783.68. Indonesia's JSX Composite slid 2.3% to 3454.12.

China's gross domestic product rose 9.8% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, exceeding forecasts for 9.2% growth in a Dow Jones Newswires poll, as well as the third quarter's 9.6% expansion. 

The nation's consumer-price index rose 4.6% in December, below an expected 4.7% rise, and slowing from November's 5.1% rise. 

But several economists highlighted the need for more policy tightening—including the case for an imminent interest-rate increase—to check consumer prices and cool economic growth. 

"The data doesn't change our predictions that Beijing will continue to tighten as prices are still rising on month," said BNP Paribas economist  Isaac Meng. "There's a lot of liquidity in the system and price pressure is building up." 

Citigroup economists said that with inflationary expectations remaining high, interest rates were likely to stay at elevated levels, adding that China could allow the yuan to appreciate at a faster rate to "fend off imported inflation." 

While Chinese stocks fell across the board, metals, airline and real-estate stocks were hit especially hard.
