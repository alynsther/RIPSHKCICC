The third round of English football's FA Cup, the sport's oldest knockout competition, is usually a showcase of shocking upsets and Cinderella stories.

This is the stage when Premier League teams enter the tournament, meaning a handful of the country's smallest clubs get a chance to spring surprises against illustrious opponents.

This year, however, the third round is highlighted by an encounter between two of this sport's most storied franchises as Manchester United and Liverpool meet at Old Trafford on Sunday. The two most successful clubs in the history of English football, approach the game in contrasting fortunes: United is top of the Premier League standings and has lost just once in 30 games this season. Liverpool has already suffered nine defeats in the league where it is in 12th place.

Liverpool has also managed just a single league win on the road and is as long as 5/1 to beat United. Such a scenario looks highly unlikely and Coral's 4/6 for a home win looks a good price.

No club has had its name engraved on this trophy more than United which boasts 11 tournament wins. Sir Alex Ferguson, the United manager, has been at the helm for five of those triumphs and his club is 6/1 joint-favorite with Chelsea to be this season's winner.

Manchester City, at 7/1, as well as Arsenal and Tottenham, available at 8/1 and 10/1 respectively, are the other leading contenders.
