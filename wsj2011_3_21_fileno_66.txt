Like a great opera,  Tre Otto offers enjoyment tinged with occasional sadness.

The Italian restaurant at Madison and East 97th street recently turned a year old. Without providing anything too showy, it's carved out a niche in a part of town not known for fine cuisine. 

Tre Otto offers mostly straightforward Italian classics, turning out tasty thin-crust pizzas and warming pastas like a lasagna served in terra cotta dish. Its Sicilian chef spices up the menu with a few specials from back home, like grilled marinated octopus and stuffed saffron rice ball with beef ragout. 

Then there's the sadness. The restaurant's name is Italian for three eights, a reference to the day the grandmother of one of the owners passed away. 

Tre Otto is also a short walk from Mount Sinai medical center, making it a popular destination for people who have visited someone in the hospital. "They could have just had a really happy moment," says  Lauren Cangiano, another owner, "or a sad one."
