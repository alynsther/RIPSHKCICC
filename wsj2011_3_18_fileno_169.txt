Actor  Robert De Niro is expected to testify Friday in the trial of a former deputy to prominent art dealer Lawrence Salander, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Mr. De Niro's testimony in New York state Supreme Court in Manhattan is expected to center on the sale of his father's paintings by  Leigh Morse, who worked for Mr. Salander at his Upper East Side gallery until the dealer was exposed for operating an art Ponzi scheme. Mr. Salander pleaded guilty and was sentenced last year to six to 18 years in state prison. 

A spokesman for Mr. De Niro did not respond to a request for comment.

Ms. Morse is charged by the Manhattan District Attorney's office with fraud and grand larceny for allegedly keeping the proceeds from the sale of Mr. De Niro's father's work instead of turning them over to the actor, who administers his father's estate. An attorney for Ms. Morse did not respond to a request for comment.
