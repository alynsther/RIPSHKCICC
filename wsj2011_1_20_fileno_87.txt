Stocks suffered their steepest one-day drop in nearly two months, but you wouldn't have known it by looking at the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average.

That index fell a mere 12.64 points, or 0.11%, to 11825.29. But the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index tumbled 13.10 points, or 1.01%, to 1281.92. That was the biggest one-day drop for the S&P 500 since Nov. 23 and comes after a seven-week run that saw the markets trickle steadily 7.8% higher.

The difference was the product of the two index's different constituents. The Dow, which tracks 30 of the biggest blue-chip stocks in the U.S., doesn't include some of the day's biggest losersâ€”including  Ford Motor, Office Depot, steelmakers  U.S. Steel and  AK Steel Holding and financial institutions  Northern Trust, Regions Financial, State Street and Goldman Sachs. Each of those stocks tumbled 4% or more on Wednesday, as weak earnings from big banks sent investors into safer assets.

The Dow, in contrast, saw only limited declines, thanks in part to the heavy weighting of  International Business Machines in calculating the Dow's performance. IBM soared 3.4% after a strong earnings report to claim the top spot among both Dow and S&P 500 components.

"I can't really remember the last time the Dow and the S&P 500 have been this far apart," said  Bob Auer, portfolio manager of Auer Growth Fund.

According to Birinyi Associates, the last time the gap between the S&P 500 and the Dow was this wide was in June 2009, when Boeing pulled the Dow down while the S&P 500 outperformed by 0.93%, far more than the long-term average gap of 0.21%. 

Even with Wednesday's gap between the two indexes, it was clear stocks were under pressure. Only one in five stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange advanced, while 88% of trading happened in declining stocks.

Small-cap stocks fared particularly badly, with the Russell 2000 Index sliding 2.6%, its biggest one-day fall since August.

As investors dumped stocks, they sought refuge in Treasurys, which rose across the board to push the yield on the benchmark 10-year note down to 3.339%.

"This was due; for the past four months, the market has almost gone straight up," Mr. Auer said. "Four months without even shaking the tree? I don't think this is too bad."

Wednesday's declines were led by financial giants  Bank of America and  American Express, the Dow's two weakest components. Amex lost 2.4% after the card company projected fourth-quarter earnings slightly below Wall Street estimates and said it will cut about 550 jobs as it consolidates some facilities. BofA fell 4.2% ahead of its earnings results on Friday, amid general gloominess around the country's largest banks.

A crop of disappointing bank earnings soured the market's mood on financials, one of the biggest beneficiaries of the recent rally on the stock market.

The biggest letdown came from Goldman Sachs, which saw its fourth-quarter earnings narrowly beat Street estimates but fall short on revenue. Shares of Goldman fell 4.7%, while rival  Morgan Stanley sank 3.5%.

Northern Trust sank 5.7% after its fourth-quarter earnings dropped 22% as persistently low interest rates constrained the trust-and-custody bank's interest income and trust fee levels. State Street fell 4.1% after fourth-quarter profit plunged 84% on charges, and the money manager said it would reduce its work force by 1,400 employees and trim its real-estate holdings.

  Wells Fargo fell 2.1% after its fourth-quarter earnings just met expectations, though the bank posted stronger-than-expected revenue. J.P. Morgan Chase fell 2.3%, while  Citigroup was off 0.8%.

Materials also lagged behind as commodity prices sagged, with U.S. Steel off 5.9% and AK Steel Holding falling 4.4%.  Monsanto was also down 4.6%. Copper fell 1.3%, while crude-oil prices slipped to below $91 a barrel. Gold futures edged up.

Technology stocks were also a drag, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite falling 40.49 points, or 1.46% to 2725.36.

Shares of  Apple finished down 0.5% in choppy trading after the consumer-electronics company said first-quarter net income jumped to $6 billion, or $6.43 a share from $3.38 billion, or $3.67 a share, for the same period last year. Revenue jumped more than 70% to $26.74 billion on strong holiday sales of the iPhone and iPad. The declines add to Apple's 2.2% drop on Tuesday, after the company announced Chief Executive  Steve Jobs would be taking another medical leave.

The day's U.S. economic data was mixed. Housing starts fell 4.3% in December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 529,000 from a downwardly revised 553,000 a month earlier, the Commerce Department reported. Economists had expected overall housing starts to fall only slightly in December to a rate of 554,000. However, building permits, a gauge of future construction, surged 16.7% to an annual rate of 635,000.

The dollar weakened against both the euro and the yen. The euro traded at $1.3469, up from $1.3385 late Tuesday in New York. The U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the currency against a basket of others, fell 0.5%.

The market decline came on a day when the Investment Company Institute reported net inflows of $3.77 billion into domestic equity for the week ended Jan. 12, compared to net outflows of $4.23 billion the week before that.

"The market went up before the retail investor came in, and it can come down after they join," Mr. Auer said. "It's basically an institutional market, and if institutions are worried about China, Steve Jobs getting sick, that's going to override what  Joe Public's trying to do."
