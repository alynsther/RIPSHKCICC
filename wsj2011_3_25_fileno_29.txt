Hedge-fund manager Steve Cohen is betting big on the late Elizabeth Taylor, who died Wednesday. Mr. Cohen has enlisted Phillips de Pury to auction off a turquoise Andy Warhol portrait of the screen star for at least $20 million at its major sale of contemporary art on May 12 in New York.

The 1963 silkscreen, "Liz #5," depicts the actress during her "BUtterfield 8" heyday, her red lips forming a serene smile and her eyelids swathed in blue eyeshadow. The work comes from Warhol's signature 1960s series of pop-culture icons like Marilyn Monroe and first lady Jacqueline Kennedy.

Mr. Cohen bought the work for an undisclosed sum from the estate of major New York dealer Illeana Sonnabend, who died in 2007. Ms. Sonnabend was known for championing post-World War II artists like Jasper Johns and Robert Raushenberg. A spokesman for Mr. Cohen declined to comment, but sources familiar with the deal say he agreed to put "Liz #5" up for auction roughly two weeks ago. He also owns a turquoise Warhol portrait of Marilyn Monroe.

Near the market's peak four years ago, Christie's sold actor Hugh Grant's 1963 Warhol portrait of Ms. Taylor, "Liz," for $23.5 million.

The auction house has tried to leave as little as possible to chance. It has arranged for outside investors to guarantee Mr. Cohen an undisclosed price for the painting unless another bidder offers even more during the auctionâ€”an arrangement called a third-party guarantee.

The current auction record for Warhol was set four years ago when Christie's got $71.7 million for the artist's 1963 "Green Car Crash."
