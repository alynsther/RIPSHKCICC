NEW DELHI â€“ TVS Motor Co. said Friday its fourth-quarter net profit doubled after it sold more two- and three-wheelers, but its shares slumped as the earnings fell far short of expectations. 

India's third-largest two-wheeler maker by sales said net profit for the January-March period climbed to 416.8 million rupees ($9.4 million) from 202.9 million rupees a year earlier. Sales gained 35% to 16.05 billion rupees from 11.92 billion rupees. 

The average of forecasts from three analysts in a poll was for net profit of 566.3 million rupees. 

TVS shares plunged as much as 9.2% after the results missed estimates, but later recovered to close down 5.7% at 56.35 rupees in a Mumbai market that finished 0.8% lower. 

Increasing personal incomes, easier availability of loans and the introduction of new models is helping drive sales in the world's biggest two-wheeler market after China. Local sales of two-wheelers rose 26% to 11.79 million vehicles in the year to March 31. 

But gains from higher sales volume are getting increasingly eroded by higher costs of steel, aluminum, copper, natural rubber and other raw materials. Increased competition is also restricting companies from raising vehicle prices as much to fully protect margins. 

TVS Chief Executive  K.N. Radhakrishnan said rising costs of raw materials can impact the company's profit margins in coming quarters. "We raised vehicle prices in April and are constantly monitoring them [raw material prices]." 

TVS spent 11.82 billion rupees on buying raw materials such as steel, aluminum and tires during the fourth quarter, up 47% from a year earlier. Input costs surged 53% in the past year to 46.26 billion rupees.

Net profit for the just-ended year more than doubled to 1.93 billion rupees from 880.1 million rupees. Sales rose 42% to 61.78 billion rupees.

In the past year, TVS Motor's scooter and motorcycle sales climbed 32% to 2.01 million units while three-wheeler sales nearly tripled to 39,860 vehicles. 

The company's head of marketing, H.S. Goindi, said TVS vehicle sales are expected to grow at a slower pace of between 12% and 15% this financial year due to the higher sales base of last year. 

"We will be raising our two-wheeler capacity to 2.6 million vehicles a year from 2.2 million vehicles currently," he said. 

The company plans to launch a new motorcycle and a scooter during the January-March quarter of 2012, he added. 

TVS Motor produces two- and three-wheelers at its two factories in south India and at another in the north. Its motorcycle models include the Flame, Jive and Star City. It also produces the Wego scooter.
