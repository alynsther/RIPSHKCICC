BUENOS AIRES -- A member of Argentine President  Cristina Fernandez's staff was robbed Wednesday while taking a bundle of cash to his home in the city's trendy Palermo Soho neighborhood. 

A presidential spokesman said Thursday that the man,  Rodolfo Stefanon, is an air force official whose job is to coordinate presidential trips abroad. 

Mr. Stefanon was robbed outside his house while carrying $68,000 in U.S. dollars and 17,000 euros, according to statements that Mr. Stefanon made to federal police. He declared that the money was to be used to pay for incidental and operational costs during the president's trip later this week to the Middle East. 

A press officer at the Casa Rosada, the president's administrative office building, said it is normal for staffers and military officials to carry cash on presidential trips.
