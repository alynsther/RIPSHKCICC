House Speaker John Boehner quickly responded to talk that his plans for an early vote on repealing ObamaCare would be sidetracked or killed in the Senate.

Even before he was sworn in, Mr. Boehner sent a terse letter to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and other key Democrats. "Thank you for reminding us -- and the American people -- of the backroom deal that you struck behind closed doors with 'Big Pharma,' resulting in bigger profits for the drug companies, and higher prescription drug costs for 33 million seniors enrolled in Medicare Part D, at a cost to the taxpayers of $42.6 billion," the letter read. "The House is going to pass legislation to repeal that now. You're welcome."

If this week's sniping between the Republican House and Democratic Senate is any indication, you can look for precious little comity and cooperation between the two branches over the next two years. But that doesn't mean Republican initiatives are doomed in the Senate. Senate Democrats have at least eight vulnerable seats to defend in the 2012 election, and if they lose only a few of them control could flip to the Republicans. Expect Democrats in several of those vulnerable seats to cast strategic votes in favor of some key GOP priorities, including a vote rescinding the mandate requiring individuals to buy health insurance.
