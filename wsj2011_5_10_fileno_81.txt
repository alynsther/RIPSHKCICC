DENVER—The pregame news out of the Mets' clubhouse Monday was mostly grim, between Chris Young's shoulder ailing and David Wright's back (although Wright said it wasn't serious and was in the starting lineup). 

But there was at least one entertaining sight to keep the mood light.

Shortstop Jose Reyes taught utility infielder Chin-lung Hu how to play Connect Four. 

Evidently, Hu had never played the game. Reyes took three of the first four games. But improbably, Hu came back to win the next three games to take the best-of-seven set.

Reyes slammed the board and checkers in mock indignation. At least he'll always have 2010. 

During the Mets' visit to Coors Field last year, Reyes beat catcher Rod Barajas in an upset.
