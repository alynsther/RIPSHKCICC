Arizona shooting suspect Jared Lee Loughner was turned away from a Walmart store when he tried to buy ammunition, but was sold the bullets at another Walmart nearby, hours before the rampage, according to people familiar with the matter.

Federal investigators probing the shooting are focusing on the sequence of Mr. Loughner's actions as they try to establish that he was acting with some planning despite his apparent mental-health issues, according to these people.

It was unclear what caused the first Walmart store clerk to turn Mr. Loughner away that morning.

The shooting, which took place at an open meeting held by Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D., Ariz), left six dead and injured 14 others, including Ms. Giffords, who remains in critical condition with a bullet wound to her head.

Investigators are also reviewing surveillance footage showing the suspect standing in line Saturday, behind a federal judge who was later killed, in order to speak with the congresswoman, according to people familiar with the matter.

The image and the information about the bullet purchases offers further evidence the shooting was not a spur-of-the-moment incident, but was planned, these people say.

Federal authorities charged Mr. Loughner on Sunday with two counts of murder, two counts of attempted murder and a count of attempting to assassinate a member of Congress during a scheduled public appearance by Ms. Giffords here Saturday. 

More charges are expected, officials said, and Mr. Loughner, age 22, remains in federal custody. 

He is set to appear in federal court in Phoenix on Monday afternoon.

A Wal-Mart Stores Inc. spokesman did not immediately comment.
