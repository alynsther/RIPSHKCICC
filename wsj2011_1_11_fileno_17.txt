MUMBAI â€“ iGate Corp. plans to raise between $500 million and $700 million through a dollar-denominated bond to refinance the bulk of a bridge loan taken to acquire India's  Patni Computer Systems Ltd., its chief executive said Tuesday. 

The U.S.-listed software services company plans to sell the bond in the first half of 2011, and expects to pay 9% to 9.5% on the planned note, Phaneesh Murthy told Dow Jones Newswires. 

Monday, a consortium of iGate and private-equity firm Apax Partners agreed to buy a 63% stake in Patni Computer from three Patni founders and General Atlantic LLC for about $921 million. iGate has also made an offer to buy 20.6% more of Patni, which could cost another $301 million if all the shares are tendered. 

iGate secured a $700 million bridge loan from RBC Capital Markets and Jefferies & Co. to help finance the acquisition. 

Murthy said the company plans to retain Jefferies and RBC Capital Markets to manage the bond sale.
