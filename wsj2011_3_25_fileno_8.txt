PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla.â€”With time running short, the Mets are making a last-ditch push to get Carlos Beltran ready for opening day.

Beltran, who has been beset by knee injuries, played in a simulated game Thursday, which included batting practice, running the bases and taking fly balls in right field. He is slated to do the same Friday and, if all goes well, play the field in a minor-league game for the first time this spring Saturday.

The Mets still believe Beltran could be ready to start in right field when they open the season April 1 against the Florida Marlins.

But even the slightest setback now would likely land Beltran on the disabled list.

"Unfortunately, I think it is kind of a day-by-day proposition at this point," Mets general manager Sandy Alderson said. "We'll just have to see whether or not we hit the benchmarks between now and opening day, but it's tight."

The question entering spring training was whether Beltran would remain in center field or move to right. But the issue for the past month has been when Beltran would play at all.

He volunteered to move to right field early in camp, but he has yet to play the position in a game. He was the designated hitter in one exhibition game, but tendinitis in his left knee has kept him out of games since.

If he remains out of major-league spring training games, the Mets can backdate his stint on the disabled list, which would make him eligible to return April 6 at Philadelphia. Still, Alderson said there is added significance to having Beltran ready for the opener.

"I think opening day is kind of like the Dow at 10,000," Alderson said. "If it dips below it, you don't know where it comes to rest. I think the idea is, let's see if he can be ready for opening day and let's go for it. And if he can't be, he can't be."
