Carnegie Hall released renderings on Wednesday of its Studio Towers Renovation Project, which is slated for completion in 2014. The plans will transform artists' studios and administrative offices into a 61,000-square-foot education wing. The project also will include major upgrades to backstage areas.

Clive Gillinson, executive and artistic director of Carnegie Hall, said the project is estimated to cost $200 million. Joan and Sandford Weill and the Weill Family Foundation have donated $25 million, and New York City and State have made pledges to the institution's capital campaign. 

The plans call for 24 new music rooms to accommodate different types of ensembles. The spaces will be used for educational activities, mainly in relation to the Weill Music Institute and the Academy, a two-year fellowship that brings together Carnegie Hall, the Juilliard School, the Weill Music Institute and the city's public schools.

Also included in the design is a new roof terrace—envisioned by the building's original architect—to be available to all visitors, including concertgoers. 

The accommodations for artists are meant to keep up with new halls around the world. "Every country is building concert halls. They're competing for the greatest artists. We still have to compete," said Mr. Gillinson.

Programming for the 2011-12 season—the hall's 120th—was also announced Wednesday. It will start Oct. 5 with a celebration of Tchaikovsky's only visit to America in 1891, when the composer conducted at the opening night of the music hall.
