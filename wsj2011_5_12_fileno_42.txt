Kavveri Telecom, a maker of telecommunications products, says it will consider an acquisition in Europe at its board meeting on May 20. 

The company, in a filing to the Bombay Stock Exchange, didn't divulge any other details. Earlier this week, the company had said it was in talks with private equity investors to raise between $8.94 million and $11.2 million by selling a stake in its infrastructure unit.

"The sale would be through an issue of fresh shares," said Managing Director Shivakumar Reddy at that time. 

The Indian telecom products maker owns 51% of unit Kavveri Telecom Infrastructure, while the rest is held by the founding family.
