TORONTOâ€”Quebec's premier said the province is aiming to invest in added energy capacity in a bid to lure mining companies to Quebec's vast northern reaches, part of a 25-year development plan his government unveiled Monday.

In an interview, Premier Jean Charest said the fresh government investment in energy production and infrastructure will bolster the province's already plentiful hydroelectric capacity. Quebec officials say the province's hydroelectric output will become increasingly attractive for companies, including energy-intensive mining concerns, as global scrutiny ratchets up on carbon emissions.

"One of the things that investors like about Quebec is the price of energy," Mr. Charest said. Government investment in energy and private-sector mining investment will "superimpose one on the other," he said.

Quebec's northern territory holds abundant reserves of precious and industrial metals but has been largely overlooked amid today's global commodities boom. On Monday, Quebec officials announced an ambitious, 25-year economic development plan for the north of the province, which Quebec hopes will attract 80 billion Canadian dollars (US$83 billion) in investment and generate tens of thousands of new jobs.

As part of that push, Mr. Charest said the province had already lined up 11 firm commitments by mining companies to build new projects, for a total investment of more than C$8 billion.

He also said the province's recent increase in government royalties for mining projects hasn't deterred new entrants. "It has not had an effect on investment," he said. 

He said fresh mining legislation his government is pushing in the provincial parliament will also provide "predictability" for mining investors. "I think it will make everyone's life easier," he said.
