This weekend, the 21-year-old Australian actress Mia Wasikowska tackles yet another 19th-century literary heroine: Charlotte BrontÃ«'s Jane Eyre in Focus Features's new adaptation of the novel. 

"After 'Alice in Wonderland,' there was thought that things might change for me, but they didn't really," Ms. Wasikowska said at Wednesday's "Jane Eyre" premiere at the Tribeca Grand. "I think I'm too boring for the paparazzi."

Not too boring for Glenn Close. "Mia is a complete joyous original," Ms. Close said. "I loved the movie, and that's a toughie. Did you know she filmed the rainy scene at the beginning of filming and was basically sick for the rest of the shoot?"

Michael Fassbender, who stars opposite Ms. Wasikowska in the film, is also poised to break out this year in a handful of films, including an "X-Men" prequel. On Wednesday, he was so busy he went straight from the red carpet to the shoot of an upcoming feature co-starring Carey Mulligan. "I still haven't seen 'Jane Eyre,'" he joked.
