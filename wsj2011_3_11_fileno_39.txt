Stocks edged narrowly lower on Wednesday as tensions in Libya trapped trading in a tight range on the two-year anniversary of the bull market's start. 

The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 1.80 points, or 0.1%, to 1320.02, exactly two years after the measure hit its lowest close of the bear market at 677. 

Since March 9, 2009, the S&P 500 has surged more than 95%. That is the strongest two-year bull market since 1962 and one that added $6.2 trillion in market capitalization to the S&P 500, according to Birinyi Associates.

The Nasdaq Composite fell 14.05, or 0.5%, to 2751.72. The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged down fractionally, by 1.29 points to 12213.09, a gain of nearly 87% from its March 2009 low of 6547. 

Earlier this year, the S&P 500 had doubled its level from the March 2009 lows, but it has pulled back recently in the wake of unrest in the Middle East and North Africa.

On Wednesday, prices for crude oil retreated slightly, with Nymex crude for April delivery settling below $105 a barrel as an increase in U.S. oil stockpiles briefly turned traders' attention from the fighting in Libya. 

Investors predicted the market would trade sideways in the absence of any significant data or development overseas.

"We'll see this up-and-down motion until the Middle East situation calms down one way or the other," said  Dick Del Bello, senior partner at Conifer Group. "The improvement in the jobs picture is actually overshadowed by the unrest in the Middle East and the potential for oil prices to rise," he said. "I think we are going to waffle here for a while."

Others said the market had been looking for an excuse to slow its rapid climb since August and could resume its upward momentum.

"To this point, there's not enough clear evidence of economic weakness or enough rise in the price of energy to cause economic weakness—this is more an excuse to correct," said  Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank. 

"Unless something truly blows up in the Middle East with respect to oil supplies, probably some of that uncertainty will die down and we'll see the market go back to rally mode again," he said. 

In U.S. economic data Wednesday, wholesale inventories rose a more-than-expected 1.1% to a seasonally adjusted $436.88 billion in January, its highest level since November 2008. Economists had predicted a 0.9% increase. Meanwhile, sales rose 3.4%, boosted by sales of cars and petroleum.

The dollar weakened against both the euro and the yen. Late in New York, the euro was at $1.3904, little changed from its level late Tuesday. In a bond auction, Portugal sold the maximum intended €1 billion ($1.39 billion) of debt but had to pay a high yield that did little to reduce expectations the country will end up asking for a bailout.

U.S.-listed shares of Nokia rose nine cents, or 1.1%, to 8.60, after the Finnish cellphone giant said it will continue selling handsets that use its own Symbian operating system for as long as it is profitable to do so. Bernstein also upgraded the company to "market perform" from "underperform" late Tuesday. 

Fiber-optic equipment maker Finisar tumbled 15.43, or 39%, to 24.61, after its fiscal third-quarter earnings more than tripled, but it offered a weak forecast for the current quarter.
